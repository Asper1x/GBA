Spices contain natural antioxidants that can inhibit the\noxidation of fats and oils and the formation of hazardous substances. In this experiment, the effect of\nadding different levels (0.25%, 0.75%, 1.25%) of ginger or rosemary during meatball preparation on\nthe formation of HCAs, PAHs and TFAs in fried pork balls was investigated. The results showed\nthat the addition of ginger and rosemary reduced the content of HCAs in fried pork balls compared\nto the control group (no added spices). The inhibition of total HCAs was 63% when 0.25% ginger\nwas added, while the total HCA content was reduced to 59% when 0.25% rosemary was added. The\naddition of 0.25% and 0.75% rosemary reduced the PAH content in fried pork balls by 30% and 35%.\nIn addition, ginger and rosemary showed signi\ufb01cant inhibition of C20:1 11t in TFAs, with a maximum\ninhibition rate of 40%. Therefore, adding appropriate levels of ginger or rosemary to fried pork balls\ncould simultaneously inhibit the formation of HCAs, PAHs, and TFAs.\nKeywords: heterocyclic amines; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; trans fatty acids; inhibitory\npro\ufb01le; antioxidant\n1. Introduction\nDeep-fried meat products have an attractive color and unique \ufb02avor, so they are\noften favored in daily life. However, numerous studies have shown that deep-fried meat\nproducts contain heterocyclic amines (HCAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),\ntrans fatty acids (TFAs), and other harmful substances [ 1,2]. IQ in HCAs is classi\ufb01ed as\na probable human carcinogen (Class 2A) by the International Agency for Research on\nCancer (IARC), and MelQ, MelQx, PhIP , A \u000bC, MeA \u000bC, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, and Glu-P-1 are\nalso labeled as possible human carcinogens (Class 2B) [ 3]. Hundreds of PAHs are found\nin the environment and have been classi\ufb01ed by the International Agency for Research\non Cancer. Benzo[a]pyrene has been categorized as group 1 (carcinogenic to humans).\nDibenzo[a,h]anthracene (DahA) and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene have been classi\ufb01ed as group\n2A (possibly carcinogenic to humans). Benzo[a]anthracene (BaA), benzo[b]\ufb02uoranthene\n(BbF), and benzo[j]\ufb02uoranthene (BjF) are listed as group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to\nhumans) [ 4]. The PAHs present in food are benzo(a)anthracene (BaA), chrysene (Chr),\nbenzo(b)\ufb02uoranthene (BbF), and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). The formation of PAHs in food is\nmainly due to pyrolysis of the organic matter thermal-synthesis reaction and incomplete\ncombustion of the heat source [ 5]. In addition, for fried foods, the quality and type of oil\nused for frying has an important in\ufb02uence on the formation of PAHs in fried foods, where\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11233767 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767 2 of 12\nblended oils are more stable than single oils [ 6]. TFAs in people\u2019s daily diet are mainly\nformed during the processing of food, such as the hydrogenation and heat treatment of\nfats and oils, and research has also shown a link between TFAs and cancer and type 2\ndiabetes [ 7]. Since these hazards are not only carcinogenic but also cause other diseases,\nthere is a great deal of interest in measures to effectively reduce the production of harmful\nsubstances in fried meat products.\nScholars have proposed a number of measures to retain the characteristics of fried\nmeat products while effectively reducing the risks, including through improved processing\nmethods, low temperature and short cooking times, the use of appropriate frying oils, and\nthe addition of antioxidants [ 8,9]. As the safety of industrial synthetic antioxidants is still\nin doubt, the inhibition of natural antioxidants against hazards generated during food\nprocessing has become one of the focal points of research. The main sources of natural\nantioxidants are herbs and spices, in addition to some fruits that also contain antioxidant\nsubstances. Some have been shown to inhibit the production of hazardous substances\nduring the processing of meat products. Wang et al. studied the effect of eight pure\nphenolic compounds, including green tea extract, on the formation of PAHs in charcoal\ngrilled chicken wings and found that these phenolic compounds inhibited PAH formation\nfrom 15.1% to 54.5% [ 10]. Meurillon et al. reported that resveratrol completely inhibited\nMeIQ in beef patties and reduced the formation of MeIQx and PhIP by 40% and 70%,\nrespectively [ 11]. However, there are few reports on the synchronous inhibition of multiple\nhazards in meat products by natural active substances.\nGinger and rosemary are two spices with unique \ufb02avors that are often used in daily\nfood preparation. The active ingredient in ginger is mainly curcumin, which has strong\nantioxidant activity, while rosemary contains substances with antioxidant capacity such as\nsyringic acid, rosmarinic acid, syringol, etc. [ 12,13]. In addition, studies have shown that\nrosemary extract has high heat resistance, with a loss of only 6% at a frying temperature of\n190\u000eC, and could effectively inhibit the production of polar substances during frying [ 14].\nBecause of the above properties of ginger and rosemary, these two spices were chosen as\nthe subjects of this experiment. Currently, the simultaneous inhibitory effects of ginger and\nrosemary on HCAs, PAHs, and TFAs in meat products have not been fully investigated.\nThe presence and hazard of HCAs, PAHs, and TFAs have become a major concern for\nboth consumers and researchers. Hence, the effect of adding different levels (0.25%, 0.75%,\n1.25%) of ginger or rosemary on the content of HCAs, PAHs, and TFAs in fried pork balls\nwas investigated in this experiment. The purpose was to provide an effective measure for\nthe reduction of HCAs, PHAs, and HCAs in fried pork balls.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Materials and Reagents\nLean pork was purchased from a local market (Tianjin, China). Visible fat and tendons\nin the pork were trimmed off and stored at 4\u000eC. Ginger powder and rosemary powder\nwere commercial spices produced by McCormick Company (Hunt Valley, MD, USA). The\noil used for frying was commercial soybean oil produced by Shandong Luhua Group Co.\n(Yantai, China).\nThe standards MeIQ (2-Amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline), IQx (2-amino-\n3-methylimidazo [4,5-f]-quinoxaline), MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, 7,8-DiMeIQx (2-amino-3,7,8-\n[4,5-f]quinoxaline), PhIP , Harman, Norharman, Trp-P-2 (3-Amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido\n[4,3-b]indole), A \u000bC (2-Amino-9H-pyrido [2,3-b]indol), MeA \u000bC (2-Amino-3-methyl-9H-\npyrido [2,3-b]ind-ol), IQ, BaA (Benz[a]anthracene), Chr (chrysene), BaP (benzo[a]pyrene),\nBbF (benzo[b]\ufb02uorant-hene), C16:1 9t, C18:1 9t, C18:1 11t, C18:2 9t 12t, and C20:1 11t\nwere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Thiobarbituric acid (TBA),\ntetraethoxypropane (TEP), anhydrous sodium bisulfate, potassium ferrocyanide, formic\nacid, hydrochloric acid, n-hexane, Isooctane, cyclohexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate,\nacetonitrile, and ethanol were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd.\n(Shanghai, China). Gallic acid and 1,1-diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazine (DPPH) were\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767 3 of 12\npurchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Petroleum ether, potas-\nsium hydroxide, ammonia water, sodium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, and sodium\nacetate were purchased from Tianjin Baishi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).\nFolin\u2013Ciocalteu reagent and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were purchased from\nSolarbio Life Science Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Zinc acetate and sodium hydroxide were\npurchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Methanol was\npurchased from Fisher Scienti\ufb01c (Loughborough, UK). Solid phase extraction C-18 column\n(500 mg, 6 mL) was purchased from Bonna-Agela Technologies Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).\nSolid phase extraction UPAH columns (500 mg, 6 mL) were purchased from Zhongpu\nScience (Fuzhou, China). Solid phase extraction Oasis\u00aeMCX column (60 mg, 3 mL) was\npurchased from Waters Corporation Co. (Milford, MA, USA).\n2.2. Preparation and Cooking Process of Pork Balls\nTenderloin in the fresh pork was cleaned, and the excess fat and tendons were removed\nand ground by a meat grinder. Then 0.25%, 0.75%, or 1.25% of ginger or rosemary were\nadded to the ground meat, mixed thoroughly, and placed in a refrigerator at 4\u000eC for 6 h.\nA control group (no spices added to the minced meat) was also set up. A total of 20.0 g\n(accurate to 0.01 g) of mince was then weighted and shaped into balls using molds. The fryer\nwas preheated, and the meat was fried using soybean oil at 180\u000eC for 3 min. Excess oil was\nabsorbed using absorbent paper to record the \ufb01nal weight and calculate the cooking loss\nrate. Cooking loss rate calculations were as follows: [(Wr\u0000Wc)\u0004(Wr\u0002100)], where\nWr is the weight of raw pork balls and Wc is the weight of cooked pork balls after frying.\nThe fried pork balls were stored at \u000018\u000eC for further analysis and testing.\n2.3. Moisture, pH, and Fat Content Analysis\nThe moisture content of fried pork balls was determined according to the Chinese\nnational standard method (GB5009.3, 2016). The pH of fried pork balls was determined\naccording to the Chinese national standard method (GB5009.237, 2016). The fat content\nwas determined by the Soxhlet extraction method.\n2.4. Determination of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) Values\nThe TBARS values in the samples were determined by referring to the method of\nJin et al., with slight modi\ufb01cations [ 15]. A standard curve was plotted using 20 \u0016g/L,\n50\u0016g/L, 100 \u0016g/L, 200 \u0016g/L, and 500 \u0016g/L 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane (TEP) solutions.\nTo 2 g of meat sample, 10 mL of 7.5 g/100 mL TCA (containing 0.1% EDTA) was added,\nand the sample was homogenized with a 5000 rpm high-speed homogenizer for 30 s; then,\nto 3 mL of \ufb01ltrate, 3 mL of 0.02 mol/L TBA solution as added, mixed well and kept in\na boiling water bath at 100\u000eC for 1 h. After removing the samples and cooling them\nto room temperature, the absorbance values were measured at 532 nm using an enzyme\nmarker (Varioskan LUS, Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). The TBA values of the samples were\ncalculated by comparison with the TEP standard curve, and the results were expressed as\nmg MDA/kg (in meat samples) (MDA is malondialdehyde).\n2.5. Determination of Total Phenolic Content (TPC) and Antioxidant Capacity of Spices\nTotal phenolic content was determined using Folin\u2013Ciocalteu agent. Then, 1 g of spices\nwas added to 30 mL of ethanol and water (6:4, v/v) and extracted ultrasonically at 70\u000eC\nfor 1 h; the sample was then centrifuged at 6000 \u0002gand the supernatant was extracted.\nThe supernatant was diluted appropriately, and 0.5 mL of the diluted extract was mixed\nwith 1 mL of Folin\u2013Ciocalteu reagent for 5 min; then, 1 mL of 10% Na 2CO 3was added and\nallowed to react under light-proof conditions for 1 h. The absorbance was measured at\n760 nm wavelength using an enzyme marker (Varioskan LUS, Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA).\nThe standard curve was prepared using 40 \u0016g/mL, 60 \u0016g/mL, 100 \u0016g/mL, 150 \u0016g/mL,\nand 200 \u0016g/mL of gallic acid solution. The results were expressed as gallic acid equivalents\n(GAE) per gram dry weight (dry weight). The supernatant obtained from spice extraction\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767 4 of 12\nwas freeze-dried to obtain spice extracts and con\ufb01gured into different concentrations of\nsample solutions to determine the antioxidant capacity of spices. The scavenging capacity\nof spices for DPPH radicals referred to the method of Sethi, with slight modi\ufb01cations [16].\nThe scavenging capacity of ABTS radicals referred to the method of Villano, with slight\nmodi\ufb01cations [17].\n2.6. Determination of HCAs\nThe detection method of Wang et al. was used [ 18]. A total of 1 g of minced meat\nsample was weighed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and 10 mL of 0.1 mol/L NaOH was added\nand vortexed for 5 min; then, 10 mL of acetonitrile was added and vortexed for 1 min, and\n6 g of MgSO 4and 1.5 g of sodium acetate were added and vortexed for 5 min. Finally,\nthe mixture was centrifuged at 2300 \u0002gfor 5 min, and the supernatant was collected and\nthe and solid phase extraction performed. The MCX column was activated with 3 mL\nof methanol and 3 mL of 0.01 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution. The entire collected\nsupernatant was transferred to the activated column so that the target was adsorbed in\nthe packing of the solid extraction column. After the supernatant transfer was completed,\n3 mL of 2% formic acid water, 9 mL of deionized water, and 3 mL of methanol were used to\nwash the debris. The MCX column was then lavaged with 3 mL of methanol/ammonium\nhydroxide (9:1, v/v), and the eluate was collected. The eluate was nitrogen blown dry\nand then re-dissolved with 1 mL of methanol. The resolution was \ufb01ltered through an\norganic microporous membrane (0.22 \u0016m) and placed in a sample vial to be analyzed by\nUPLC-MS/MS (ACQUITY/XevoTQ-S micro, Waters, Milford, MA, USA).\nThe separation of HCAs was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column. The\ntemperature of the column was set at 45\u000eC. The mobile phases, A and B, were ultrapure\nwater and acetonitrile, respectively. The \ufb02ow rate was set at 0.5 mL/min, and the injection\nvolume was 1 \u0016L. The mobile phase gradient program was: 0\u20130.5 min, 90% A; 0.5\u201310 min,\n50\u201390% A; 10\u201310.1 min, 50\u201390% A; 10\u201315 min, 90% A. ESI was performed in positive-ion\nmode; MRM mode was used for MS/MS detection. The optimal ionization source working\nparameters were as follows: nebulizer pressure, 40 psi; capillary voltage, 900 V . The drying\ngas \ufb02ow rate and temperature were 800 L/Hr and 400\u000eC, the cone gas \ufb02ow rate was\n60 L/Hr, and the ion source temperature was 150\u000eC. The validation results of the method\nare shown in Supplementary Table S1.\n2.7. Determination of P AH4\nThe detection method of Lee et al. was used, with slight modi\ufb01cations [ 19]. A total of\n5 g of minced meat sample was weighed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and 20 g of anhydrous\nsodium sulfate and 20 mL of cyclohexane-ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) were added. After vortex\nshaking for 1 min and ultrasonic extraction for 15 min, the sample was then centrifuged at\n2300\u0002gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was aspirated and blown under nitrogen until\nnearly dry. Then, 5 mL of 1.5 mol/L potassium hydroxide-ethanol solution was added\nto the ultrasonic solution for 5 min, followed by a water bath at 70\u000eC for 2 min, and the\ncentrifuge tube was removed and cooled rapidly. Then, 4 mL of ultrapure water and 5 mL\nof hexane was added, vortexed, and shaken for 2 min; it was then centrifuged at 9400 \u0002g\nfor 2 min, and the upper layer of the hexane extract was aspirated for puri\ufb01cation. The\npuri\ufb01cation step was to add 1 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the UPAH column and\nthen activate the UPAH column with 5 mL of dichloromethane and 5 mL of n-hexane in\nturn (control the liquid drop rate of 1\u20132 drops/s); all supernatants were aspirated over\nthe activated UPAH column, washed with 4 mL of n-hexane to remove impurities, and\n\ufb01nally eluted with 5 mL of dichloromethane-ethyl acetate mixture. The eluate was collected\nand concentrated to near dryness by nitrogen blowing at 4\u000eC. A total of 0.5 mL of the\nacetone-isooctane mixture was added, vortexed, mixed to fully dissolve the PAHs, and\nanalyzed by GC-MS (7890B-5977A, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\nThe separation of PAHs was achieved using an HP-5MS (30 m \u00020.25 mm \u00020.25\u0016m)\ncolumn with programmed temperature rise. The carrier gas was helium at a \ufb02ow rate of\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767 5 of 12\n1.0 mL/min. A total of 1 \u0016L of the extract was automatically injected using a non-split\nmode with an inlet temperature of 320\u000eC. The column temperature was programmed\nwith a programmed ramp, and the starting temperature of the column was set at 0.5\u000eC.\nThe column temperature was programmed to start at 80\u000eC, held for 1 min, and ramped\nup to 220\u000eC at a rate of 4\u000eC/min, and then to 280\u000eC at a rate of 20\u000eC/min and held\nfor 10 min. The transfer line and ion source temperatures were set to 280\u000eC and 250\u000eC,\nrespectively, using an electron bombardment (EI) ionization source with an electron energy\nof 70 eV and a solvent delay time of 3 min. The analysis of PAHs was performed in selective\nion monitoring mode (SIM mode). The validation results of the method are shown in\nSupplementary Table S1.\n2.8. Determination of TFAs\nThe TFAs in the samples were in accordance with the method of Zribi et al., with\nslightly modi\ufb01cations [ 20]. The fat was extracted by Soxhlet extraction, and 60 mg was\ntaken to prepare the fatty acid methyl esters. First, 4 mL of hexane was added for dissolv-\ning, followed by 0.2 mL of 2 mol/L potassium hydroxide-methanol solution; the sample\nwas vortexed, mixed for 1 min, and left until the mixture in the tube was clari\ufb01ed. The\nsupernatant was \ufb01ltered through an organic microporous membrane (0.22 \u0016m) and placed\nin a sample bottle for GC analysis (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).\nThe GC analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen\n\ufb02ame ionization detector and a split injector. The samples were separated using an HP-88\ncapillary column (100 m \u00020.25 \u0016m\u00020.2\u0016m). The inlet temperature was 250\u000eC, and\nthe detector temperature was 250\u000eC. The sample was manually injected at a split ratio\nof 1:29 in a volume of 1 \u0016L. The carrier gas was helium at a \ufb02ow rate of 1.0 mL/min.\nThe determination was performed by gas chromatography. The column temperature was\nprogrammed to start at 120\u000eC and held for 4 min, then increased to 175\u000eC at a rate of\n10\u000eC/min and held for 6 min, and then increased to 210\u000eC at a rate of 5\u000eC/min and held\nfor 12.5 min.\n2.9. Inhibitory Rates of HCAs, P AH4, and TFAs\nInhibition rate (%) calculations were as follows: [(Ac\u0000At)\u0004(Ac\u0002100)], where\nAc is the concentration of hazards in the control sample and At is the concentration of\nhazards in the pork balls containing spices.\n2.10. Statistical Analysis\nThe results were expressed as mean \u0006standard deviation (SD). SPSS (v. 26.0) was used\nfor the analysis of experimental data. Origin Pro (v. 2021) was used for drawing \ufb01gures.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Antioxidant Capacity and TPC of Spices\nThe antioxidant capacities of ginger and rosemary as well as the total phenolic content\nare shown in Table 1. The antioxidant activities of DPPH radicals and ABTS radicals were\nexpressed as IC 50values (mg/mL). In the DPPH radical scavenging capacity assay, the\nIC50values were 0.26 mg/mL for ginger extract and 0.03 mg/mL for rosemary extract. The\nIC50values of the ABTS radical scavenging capacity assay of ginger and rosemary extract\nwere 4.60 mg/mL and 0.93 mg/mL, respectively. The results showed that rosemary had a\nstronger scavenging capacity for DPPH radicals and ABTS radicals than ginger. In addition,\nthe total antioxidant capacity of the two spice extracts measured by the FRAP method was\n0.58\u00060.01\u0016mol/mL and 3.74 \u00060.04\u0016mol/mL, respectively, indicating once again that the\nantioxidant capacity of rosemary was stronger than that of ginger. From the data in Table 1,\nit can be observed that the total phenolic content of the two spices differed signi\ufb01cantly,\nwith the total phenolic content of ginger being 9.90\u00060.27 mg GAE/g and that of rosemary\nbeing 61.34 \u00061.23 mg GAE/g. The results indicate that the higher the total phenolic\ncontent, the stronger the antioxidant activity. Many studies have also reported a correlation\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767 6 of 12\nbetween total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Erkan et al. investigated the\nphenolic content and antioxidant activity of blackseed essential oil and rosemary extract,\nand the results showed that the phenolic content of rosemary was higher than blackseed\nessential oil and the antioxidant activity of rosemary extract was also higher [ 21]. Noreen\net al. showed experimentally that phenolic compounds were the main contributors to the\nantioxidant activity [22].\nTable 1.

Moisture, pH, Fat Content, and Cooking Loss of Deep-Fired Pork Balls\nTable 2 shows the effect of ginger and rosemary on the cooking loss rate, moisture\ncontent, pH, and fat content of deep-fried pork balls at different addition levels. The\naddition of spices had a signi\ufb01cant effect on the cooking loss values of the deep-fried pork\nballs compared to the control group, and the cooking loss values in the samples decreased\nas the amount added increased. This result is in agreement with the \ufb01ndings of Oz, who\nshowed that the use of black cumin in meatball preparation signi\ufb01cantly reduced the\ncooking loss values [ 23]. It has been reported that some substances such as myogenic \ufb01bers,\ncollagen, and lipids are lost during cooking, in addition to water [ 24]. The moisture content\nof deep-fried pork balls treated with spices increased signi\ufb01cantly ( p< 0.05) compared to\nthe control group, and this result could be attributed to the absorption of some of the free\nwater in the pork balls by the spices as a dry substance. It is noteworthy that a negative\ncorrelation between cooking loss and moisture content was shown, which is logical. From\nthe values shown in Table 2, it can be observed that the pH values of all samples were\nslightly acidic, with values ranging from 6.47 to 6.72. The addition level of spices had no\nsigni\ufb01cant effect on the pH of deep-fried pork balls ( p> 0.05). Kilic et al. also found that\nthe added level of turmeric did not affect the pH of deep-fried chicken pork balls [ 25].

Effect of Spice Addition on the TBARS of Deep-Fried Pork Balls\nThe production and storage of meat products are often accompanied by lipid oxidation,\nand numerous studies have shown that the lipid oxidation of meat is one of the causes of the\nquality of meat products. In this experiment, TBARS values were used to characterize the\ncontent of lipid oxidation secondary products [ 26]. The TBARS values of the samples are\nshown in Figure 1. The TBARS value for the control group was 0.44 \u00060.01 mg MDA/kg.\nThe addition of ginger and rosemary signi\ufb01cantly reduced the TBARS values of deep-\nfried pork balls ( p< 0.05), with TBARS values ranging from 0.11 to 0.15 mg MDA/kg,\nwhile the type of spice also had a signi\ufb01cant effect on the TBARS values ( p< 0.05). The\naddition of rosemary to pork balls was more effective in reducing lipid oxidation than the\naddition of ginger, probably due to the stronger antioxidant capacity of rosemary than\nginger. Numerous studies have also shown that the addition of antioxidant substances\nto meat products is effective in reducing their TBARS values. The addition of hawthorn\nextract to chicken and beef pork balls has been reported to be effective in reducing lipid\noxidation [ 27]. The addition of black cumin to deep-fried pork balls also signi\ufb01cantly\nreduced TBARS values, and the TBARS values in the samples decreased with increasing\naddition [23].\nFoods 2022, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW  7 of 13 \n \n Table 2.

Effect of Spice Addition on the TBARS of Deep-Fried Pork Balls  \nThe production and storage of meat products are often accompanied by lipid oxi-\ndation, and numerous studies have shown that the lipid oxidation of meat is one of the \ncauses of the quality of meat products. In this experiment, TBARS values were used to \ncharacterize the content of lipid oxidation secondary products  [26]. The TBARS values of \nthe samples are shown in Figure 1. The TBARS value for the control group was 0.44 \u00b1 0.01 \nmg MDA/kg. The addition of ginger and rosemary significantly reduced the TBARS \nvalues of deep -fried pork balls ( p < 0.05), with TBARS values ranging from 0.11 to 0.15 mg \nMDA/kg, while the type of spice also had a significant effect on the TBARS values ( p < \n0.05). The addition of rosemary to pork balls was more effective in reducing lipid  oxida-\ntion than the addition of ginger, probably due to the stronger antioxidant capacity of \nrosemary than ginger. Numerous studies have also shown that the addition of antioxi-\ndant substances to meat products is effective in reducing their TBARS values. Th e addi-\ntion of hawthorn extract to chicken and beef pork balls has been reported to be effective \nin reducing lipid oxidation  [27]. The addition of black cumin to deep -fried pork balls also \nsignificantly reduced TBARS values, and the TBARS values in the samp les decreased \nwith increasing addition  [23]. \n \nFigure 1.

Effect of Spices on the Formation of HCAs in Deep-Fried Pork Balls\nTable 3 shows the HCA content in the control and spice-added fried pork balls. In\nthis study, the major contributors to the total HCA content were IQ, Harman, Norharman,\nand IQx, while other HCAs, including MeIQ, MeIQx, MeA \u000bC, 4,8-DiMeIQx, 7,8-DiMeIQx,\nPhIP , Trp-P-2, and A \u000bC, were found in low levels in fried pork balls. The amount of IQ in\ndeep-fried pork balls under ginger and rosemary treatment was signi\ufb01cantly lower than\nthe control (4.16 \u00060.16 ng/g), and the least amount of IQ was obtained when 0.25% ginger\nwas added (0.43 \u00060.12 ng/g), which was inhibited by 90%. The rest of the experimental\ngroups also showed inhibition rates between 58% and 84%, indicating that the addition\nof ginger and rosemary to deep-fried pork balls effectively inhibited the production of IQ.\nThis result is consistent with the results of other studies. Lu et al. found that ginger was\neffective in inhibiting IQ in deep-fried chicken pork balls [ 1]. Murkovic et al. showed that\nrosemary can reduce IQ in meat products [ 28]. Harman was similar to the IQ results, the\nHarman content in the spice-treated samples decreased signi\ufb01cantly ( p< 0.05) compared\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767 8 of 12\nto the control group (2.02 \u00060.18 ng/g), with inhibition rates ranging from 43% to 81%.\nAmong them, the addition of rosemary had a signi\ufb01cant effect ( p< 0.05) on the content\nof Harman, and the best inhibition of Harman was achieved when 0.25% rosemary was\nadded. Unlike IQ and Harman, the addition of ginger and rosemary to pork balls had\nno inhibitory effect on the production of Norharman and showed a signi\ufb01cant increase\n(p< 0.05) compared to the control (1.44 \u00060.21 ng/g). Both the level and type of spices\nadded had a signi\ufb01cant effect ( p< 0.05) on the content of Norharman in fried pork balls,\nwith rosemary-treated pork balls having a higher amount of Norharman than that of ginger.\nThis result is similar to other reports, where Zeng et al. showed a signi\ufb01cant increase in\nNorharman content after the addition of Sichuan pepper to beef patties before cooking,\nand also suggested that the reason for this result could be the presence of Norharman or\nits precursors in Sichuan pepper [ 29]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that phenolic\nacids in spices during the processing of meat products have an enhancing effect on the\nproduction of Norharman [ 30]. The enhancement of Norharman by ginger and rosemary\nmay be due to the phenolic richness, and the stronger enhancement of Norharman by\nrosemary may be due to the higher total phenolic content of rosemary than ginger. The\naddition of ginger and rosemary was also effective in inhibiting the formation of IQx in\nfried pork balls.\nTable 3.

Shin et al. found\n13.91\u00061.81 ng/g of HCAs in fried pork [ 31]. Oz et al. also reported that the total HCA\ncontent of control beef patties fried at 175\u2013225\u000eC for 10 min per side ranged from 1.40\nto 37.81 ng/g [ 32]. The results of this study showed that the addition of spices reduced\nthe total HCA content in fried pork balls, with inhibition rates ranging from 5% to 63%.\nNumerous studies have also shown that the addition of spices such as black cumin [ 23],\ngalangal [ 33], and chili pepper [ 34] to meat products could reduce the content of total\nHCAs. In this study, the addition of 0.25%, 0.75%, and 1.25% ginger inhibited 63%, 48%,\nand 11% of total HCAs in pork balls, respectively; the addition of rosemary to pork balls at\nthe same dose as ginger resulted in 59%, 32%, and 5% inhibition of total HCAs, respectively.\nThis result indicates that the inhibition of HCAs in fried pork balls by spices was dose-\ndependent, with lower levels of spice addition showing higher inhibition effects. This result\nis similar to that reported by Zeng et al., who showed inhibition of 46%, 35%, and 24% of\ntotal HCAs when 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% of chili peppers were added to roast beef patties,\nrespectively, and suggested that it may be that some components of chili peppers have\na facilitative effect on HCA production [ 35]. In addition, Damasius et al. also indicated\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767 9 of 12\nthat some phenolic compounds and spice extracts promote the production of HCAs [ 36].\nTherefore, it may be that some phenolic compounds in ginger and rosemary promoted\nthe formation of HCAs in this study. Furthermore, antioxidants not only have antioxidant\neffects but also promote oxidation, and their effects depend on the concentration and\nconditions of the antioxidants [37].\n3.5. Effect of Spices on the Formation of P AH4 in Deep-Fried Pork Balls\nTable 4 shows the content of PAH4 in fried pork balls. BaA, Chr, and BaP were\nquanti\ufb01ed in the study, and BbF was not detected in any sample. The PAH4 content in\nthe control group in this study was 9.34 \u00060.27 ng/g. The results showed that ginger had\nno signi\ufb01cant effect on the content of Chr, BaP , and total PAH4 in deep-fried pork balls.\nThe addition of different concentrations of rosemary did not have a reducing effect on the\nBaA content of the fried pork balls compared to the control group. When 0.25% and 0.75%\nrosemary were added, Chr, BaP , and PAH4 contents in fried meatballs were signi\ufb01cantly\nreduced compared to the control group ( p< 0.05), where the addition of 0.75% rosemary had\nthe best inhibition effect on Chr, BaP , and PAH4, with 41%, 42%, and 35% inhibition rates,\nrespectively. The analysis revealed that the type of spice had a signi\ufb01cant effect on PAH4\n(p< 0.05) , and rosemary had a better inhibitory effect than ginger, probably due to the high-\ntemperature resistance of the active ingredient in rosemary [ 14]. In addition, the formation\nmechanism of PAHs is related to free radicals [ 38]. The antioxidant substances contained\nin rosemary, such as phenols, may inhibit the formation of PAHs in fried pork balls by\neliminating free radicals. However, it has also been well documented that antioxidants can\npromote oxidation at certain concentrations and under certain conditions [ 27]. Therefore,\nthe increase in BaA, Chr, and BaP content in fried pork balls at 1.25% rosemary addition\nmay be due to the pro-oxidant effect of the components in rosemary.\nTable 4.

Effect of Spices on the Formation of TFAs in Deep-Fried Pork Balls\nTable 5 shows the levels of C20:1 11t and C18:2 9t 12t and TFAs in fried pork balls.\nThree TFAs, C16:1 9t, C18:1 9t, and C18:1 11t, were not detected in any sample and therefore\nare not listed in the table. The spices showed a signi\ufb01cant inhibitory effect on C20:1 11t\nin TFAs. The addition of ginger inhibited C20:1 11t from 16% to 40%, and the addition of\nrosemary inhibited C20:1 11t from 27% to 39%. The inhibition increased with increasing\naddition levels, but the difference in content was not statistically signi\ufb01cant ( p> 0.05).\nPearson correlation analysis revealed that the C20:1 11t content of fried pork balls showed a\npositive correlation with TBARS values (r = 0.726, p\u00140.01) and a negative correlation with\ntotal phenol content (r = \u00000.928, p\u00140.01). Numerous studies have shown that cis-fatty\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3767 10 of 12\nacids can be converted to TFAs by isomerization during heating of fats and oils and that\nthermally induced isomerization is associated with lipid oxidation processes; in addition,\nlipid radicals are considered as intermediate products of isomerization reactions [ 39]. The\nantioxidant substances such as phenolic substances contained in ginger and rosemary may\ninhibit lipid peroxidation and unsaturated lipid isomerization reactions by scavenging free\nradicals generated during lipid oxidation. On the other hand, the inhibition of total TFAs\nby the addition of rosemary was stronger than that of ginger powder, and this result may\nbe related to the strong thermal stability of the antioxidant active ingredients contained in\nrosemary, such as syringic acid [14].\nTable 5.

Conclusions\nThis study investigated the effects of ginger and rosemary on the formation of HCAs,\nPAH4, and TFAs in deep-fried pork balls. The results showed that the addition of appro-\npriate amounts of ginger and rosemary had different degrees of inhibitory effects on the\nformation of HCAs, PAH4, and TFAs in deep-fried pork balls. The addition of 0.25% ginger\nor rosemary decreased the total HCAs in the fried pork balls by 63% and 59%, respectively,\ncompared with the control group, and the results showed that the lower spice addition\nconcentration showed a higher inhibitory effect. For PAH4, the addition of ginger had\nno signi\ufb01cant effect on the PAH4 content in fried pork balls, while the addition of 0.25%\nand 0.75% rosemary resulted in a signi\ufb01cant reduction in PAH4 content in fried pork balls\ncompared to the control group, which was attributed to the stronger antioxidant capacity\nof rosemary than ginger. The spices also showed signi\ufb01cant inhibition of C20:1 11t in TFAs,\nwith 40% and 39% inhibition of C20:1 11t for 1.25% ginger and rosemary, respectively.\nThe combined results of the studies found that the best overall inhibition was achieved\nwhen 0.75% rosemary was added to the fried meatballs. The above results indicate that\nthe addition of ginger and rosemary at appropriate concentrations to processed fried pork\nproducts can simultaneously reduce HCAs, PAH4, and TFAs, and the effect of rosemary\nwas stronger than that of ginger in terms of the total inhibitory effect.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:\n//www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/foods11233767/s1, Table S1: The test method veri\ufb01cation results.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.W. and Y.Z.
