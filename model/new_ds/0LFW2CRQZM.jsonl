A review of 11 existing literature articles regarding this association has been used in the\ndevelopment of this review article. There is increasing medical literature documentation of the eventual harmful effect\nof AAS misuse or abuse on the heart. Individuals who misuse these steroids are susceptible to significant debilitationand loss of productive person-hours, and in severe cases, it can lead to death. Raising awareness about this potentially\ndeleterious effect of anabolic steroids is crucial to prevent its misuse or abuse.\nKeywords\nrisk behaviors, behavioral issues, substance use, exercise, general health and wellness, public health, health care issues,body image, mental health\nReceived February 2, 2024; revised April 4, 2024; accepted April 9, 2024\nIntroduction/Epidemiological Perspective\nAn increasingly demonstrable harmful effect of\nanabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) abuse on the heartis being noted in the literature. Educating the public\nabout this then becomes a necessity. AASs are mis-\nused for performance and aesthetic purposes by ath-letes and bodybuilders. Some people abuse AAS forleisure. The untoward side effects of AAS toxicity onthe heart could be increased when used in combina-tion with other abused substances. The flow of theseabused substances is from health care professionals to\nthose who abuse these substances in the community\n(Melnik, 2009). Another way people get theseunauthorized products is via the internet. Gagnonet al. (2022) noted on a global view that about 3 out of100 persons in their lifetime would have abused AAS.This abuse problem is commoner under the produc-\ntive age of 50 years and more than 95% of AAS abuse\nproblems are in males (Kanayama et al., 2018).\nDisease Process and Impact of AAS\nT oxicity on the Heart\nExposure to higher-than-normal doses of these ster-\noids can predispose to a condition where the heartbecomes enlarged and weakened or the heart muscle\nbecoming thickened and stiff or a mix of the two. It\ncan also result in a condition where plaques build up\nin arteries of the body, narrowing and hardening them(a condition called atherosclerosis). When athero-\nsclerosis becomes severe, it can cause significant dam-\nage to the heart and to the blood vessels.\nAn unreversed heart failure after 6 months of treat-\nment in a 31-year-old male who had abused AAS for12 years and growth hormone for 1 year was noted in\na case report. The patient had quit the substance abuse\nfor a year prior to presentation to the hospital. Thesuggestion that the damage to heart muscles may be\nirreversible from prolonged duration of AAS abuse\nwas made in the publication. It was also noted thatthis could be worse in the presence of other potentiat-ing toxic agents (e.g., growth hormone misuse), as well\nas hard gym or exercise sessions (Angelini et al., 2019).\nAnother case report however reported a gradual rever-sal of an abnormal heart affectation after a 9-month\n1William Harvey Hospital, Ashford, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nDr Rabiu Momoh, William Harvey Hospital, Ashford TN24 0LZ, UK.\nEmail: rabiu.momoh@nhs.net\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC BY -NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons\nAttribution-NonCommercial 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use,\nreproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and\nOpen Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nfollow-up period in a 47-year-old non-athletic female\nwho had abused AAS for social reasons and had ini-\ntially presented with heart failure features (Gul &\nShahid, 2022).\nApart from AASs, other commonly abused sub-\nstances with the potential of causing impairment of\nthe heart\u2019s function include cocaine, alcohol, tobacco,\ncannabis, and methamphetamine. There could be an\nadditive or multiplier effect on the number of these\nsubstances abused together (Gagnon et al., 2022). In\nanother case report about a 31-year-old male who\nabused AAS for more than 2 years and abused\nmephentermine for 3 months, he had a hospital admis-\nsion for a new diagnosis of heart failure. A special test\nto look at the patient\u2019s heart (echocardiogram)\nrevealed the left side of the heart was functionallyimpaired. They also found a blood clot in that area.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, he had a type of\nstroke caused by blood clot dislodged from the heart\nto the brain. The patient\u2019s heart function improved\nafter he stopped the use of mephentermine for 2\nmonths, but then got worse again when he started tak-\ning it again after 3 months (Singal et al., 2021).\nA late effect of AAS abuse in a 73-year-old ex-\nOlympic athlete who had quit using AAS for about\nthree decades was described in a case report in 2018.\nThe patient had abused AAS for a period of about 20\nyears in his active sporting years. He presented to the\nhospital with an abnormal fast heart rhythm and, on\nassessment, was found to have a thickened left heart\nregion that had problem with contracting to push\nblood out, as well as with relaxation to receive blood\nin. It was concluded in the publication that there could\nbe long-term consequences on the heart in those whoabuse anabolic steroids many years after discontinu-\ning them (Ha et al., 2018).\nA study reviewing the toxic effect of high doses of\nnandrolone on the heart of young rabbits was pub-\nlished in 2015. The study found that the group of rab-\nbits that were administered with nandrolone (either\nunder their skin or into their muscles) had a worseheart muscle performance index compared to the\ngroup that was not injected with nandrolone. Among\nthe rabbits injected with nandrolone, although their\nheart\u2019s contractile function was preserved, there was a\nproblem with relaxation due to their thickened heart\nmusculature. Their study also noted that the adminis-\ntration of nandrolone under the skin had a worse\neffect on the heart and the body\u2019s blood vessels than\nadministering nandrolone deep into muscles (Vasilakiet al., 2016).\nA study by Bulut et al. (2023) showed that people\nwho have used AASs in the past might have problemswith the small blood vessels in their heart. The study\ncompared people who currently or formerly used AAS\nto those who did not and found that the former grouphad a decrease in the heart muscle blood flow reserve,\nas measured by a type of imaging test-positron\nemission tomogrpahy-computerized tomographyusing Rubidium Rb-82 injection (PET/CT Rb-82).\nThis suggests that the heart\u2019s small blood vessels may\nnot work as well in former AAS users.\nAnabolic Steroid Abuse and Sudden\nDeath Risk\nIn a publication reviewing sudden cardiac deaths\n(SCDs) among AAS abusers, it was noted that there isan abnormal remodeling of the heart in this group of\npeople and could result in an increased risk of life-\nthreatening abnormal heart rhythms. This is differentfrom the normal heart remodeling that occurs in ath-\nletes. The study also mentioned four possible ways\nthat SCDs among AAS abusers can occur. First, itwas mentioned the possible effect of severe plaque for-\nmation in the blood vessels that supply the heart caus-\ning a heart attack (atherogenic model). Secondly, itwas stressed that the risk of sudden severe contrac-\ntions of the blood vessels that supply the heart (vasos-\npasm model) can predispose to SCD among AASabusers. Thirdly, they stated that the formation of life-\nthreatening clots within the blood vessels that supply\nthe heart (thrombosis model) could also be responsiblefor SCD among AAS abusers, and finally, they notedthat the SCDs in AAS abusers may result from direct\ntoxicity to the heart\u2019s muscle composition (Torrisi\net al., 2020).\nClinical Approach to Treating Anabolic\nSteroid T oxicity on the Heart\nAnabolic steroid-induced heart disease can vary from\nbeing asymptomatic to a severe heart failure state or\ncausing sudden death. Clinical history-taking may\nuncover a history of substance abuse including AASabuse. Physical examination may reveal evidence or\nsigns of heart failure. Blood investigations including\nhormone panel studies, chest X-ray, blood gas studies,electrocardiogram, echocardiography, cardiac com-\nputed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging\nstudies may be needed to assess this group of patients.A multi-disciplinary care approach will be useful inthe care of AAS abusers who develop notable heart\ncomplications from anabolic steroid abuse, and this\ncould include the services of a cardiologist, endocri-nologist, substance abuse unit, radiologist, specialist2 American Journal of Men\u2019s Health\nnurses, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, diete-\ntics, and public health specialist. Stopping the use of\nthe abused steroid(s) is the major step needed in a bid\nto achieve some recoverability of the heart\u2019s impaired\nfunction. Seeking advice from a specialist in hormone\ndisorders will be useful to manage steroid withdrawal\neffects in these patients. In addition, treating the ensu-\ning heart failure is important using guideline-directed\napproach. In some cases, patients with life-threatening\nheart rhythm problems may need a pacemaker or\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillator (devices for\ntreating people with severe abnormal heart rhythms).In severe cases, devices that support the heart\u2019s func-\ntion may be used until a heart transplant is possible.\nIt\u2019s important to know that many heart transplant\nprograms require patients to be completely drug-free\nto be considered for a transplant (Bui et al., 2019).\nProposed Public Health Intervention\nPromoting awareness about the danger of AAS abusecannot be over-emphasized. Recognition of the\nimpact of this abuse problem by local, state, or federal\nstakeholders will go a long way toward putting in\nmeasures to curb the abuse problem. Educating peo-\nple via the print and electronic media, in schools, on\nsportsgrounds, and in gyms will equally be useful.\nEnhancing the control of the flow of unauthorized\nsteroids use within communities may need to be done.\nComments on References Cited\nThe publication by Melnik (2009) was a review articleabout AAS abuse problem in Germany. A more recent\nreview article regarding this abuse problem could have\nbeen more useful. Different countries may have differ-\nent experiences with AAS abuse problems. A future\nstudy detailing this multinational experience may\nreveal unique findings that could be adopted by coun-\ntries more burdened with the problem of AAS abuse.\nThe publication by Gagnon et al. (2022) described\nthe cardiovascular diseases that could complicate dif-\nferent abused substances. They noted that there could\nbe a combined effect if these substances are used\ntogether. Studies detailing the speed of onset or sever-\nity of cardiovascular diseases when the different\nabused substances are used together could be done in\nthe future to further assess.\nThe publication by Kanayama et al. (2018) was a\nreview article summarizing other recent publications\non the AAS abuse problem. More prospective and\ncommunity-based interventional studies will be useful\nin relation to the topic under review.The publication by Angelini et al. (2019) was a case\nreport detailing an unreversed effect of AAS abuse onthe heart in the affected patient with a form of heart\nfailure. The case report is informative about the dan-\nger of chronic AAS exposure; however, more molecu-lar and histologic studies of AAS-induced heartfailure will need to be done. More systematic review\nstudies about AAS-induced heart impairment will also\nbe needed.\nThe publication by Gul and Shahid (2022) was a\ncase report noting the reversal of heart failure featuresin a female who abused AAS for leisure purpose. In\ncontrast to the above publication by Angelini et al.,\nthere was a reversal of heart failure features in the casereported by Gul and Shahid. More studies to deter-mine the determinants of reversibility of heart failure\nfeatures following AAS abuse will be needed. It could\nbe preliminarily theorized that the impact of heavyexercise/gym sessions could worsen the impact of\nAAS abuse on the heart.\nThe publication by Singal et al. (2021) was also a\ncase report, but it reviewed the impact of two forms of\nsubstance abuse: AAS abuse and mephentermineabuse. More systematic review articles on the com-bined effects of these abused substances with potential\neffects on the heart will need to be done.\nThe publication by Ha et al. (2018) was a case\nreport explaining the lingering long-term effect of\nAAS abuse years after quitting its use. More tissue/radiologic studies to explain this lingering long-termeffect will be needed. Where possible, larger prospec-\ntive or cohort studies highlighting this effect will need\nto be done.\nThe publication by Vasilaki et al. (2016) revealing\nthe outcome of a prospective animal model experi-ment in relation to AAS high dose use is noted.\nEthical concerns may make such methodology unsui-\ntable in human. However, a retrospective cohort studybetween those who abused AAS and those who didnot may reveal notable findings.\nThe publication by Bulut et al. (2023) demonstrated\nthe above point by reviewing the myocardial flow\nreserve in current and previous AAS users in relation\nto recreational athletes who did not abuse AAS in acommunity-based cross-sectional study.\nThe publication by Torrisi et al. (2020) was a litera-\nture review article that focused on the risk and possi-\nble causes of SCD among AAS abusers. Systematic\nreview article publication on SCD among AAS abu-sers will be needed.\nThe publication by Bui et al. (2019) was both an\nopinion piece and having component systematicreview in it. It gave insight to patients with abuseMomoh 3\nproblems and their suitability for heart transplant. It\nnoted that heart transplant programs would ideally\nwant patients without substance abuse problems.\nConclusion\nPrimary prevention by promoting abstinence fromAAS use is the best way to prevent the associatedheart disease state that can accompany prolonged\nAAS misuse. More research to prevent unauthorized\ndistribution of this abused substance in the commu-nity as well as research aimed at improving the impact\non those with existing heart disease related to this con-\ndition should be encouraged. Public\u2013private partner-ships at curbing this abuse should be facilitated.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication ofthis article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nORCID iD\nRabiu Momoh https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8412-0912\nReferences\nAngelini, G., Pollice, P., Lepera, M.
