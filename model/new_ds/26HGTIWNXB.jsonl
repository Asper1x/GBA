Cook 4,6 & Christine M. Albert 3,4*\nBeneficial and adverse associations with arrhythmias have been reported for omega\u20113 fatty acids \n(omega\u20113 FA) and Vitamin D. The 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) contains quantitative measures \nreflecting diverse aspects of electrophysiology that might provide insights into mechanisms \nunderlying these associations. In a pre\u2011specified ancillary study of the VITaminD and omegA\u20113 \n(VITAL) trial, we examined the effect of 1 g of marine omega\u20113 FA per day, comprised of 460 mg \neicosapentanoic acid and 380 mg of docosahexaenoic acid, and 2000 IU  VitaminD3 per day on ECG \ncharacteristics associated with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias among individuals age 50 years or \ngreater. A total of 911 study participants underwent ECGs at baseline and again at 2 years after the \nrandomization. Individuals randomized to active omega\u20113 FA demonstrated significant net increase \nin PR \u2011interval duration (p  = 0.005) and P\u2011wave duration (p  = 0.03) as well significant net decrease in \nP\u2011wave amplitude (p  = 0.037) as compared to placebo. RMSSD increased to a greater extent in the \nomega\u20113 FA arm compared to placebo (p  = 0.040). For Vitamin  D3, the Cornell voltage increased to a \nlesser extent in the participants assigned to active treatment as compared to placebo (p  = 0.044). There \nwere no other significant differences in QRS, QTc, Cornell voltage or heart rate. Thus, randomized \ntreatment with omega\u20113 FA supplements resulted in changes on the ECG that are potentially reflective \nof heightened vagal tone and/or slowing of intraatrial and AV conduction. Vitamin  D3 supplementation \nresulted in modest reductions in progressive LV voltage suggestive of a potential antihypertrophic \neffect.\nTrial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01169259, NCT02178410 (06/26/2010 and \n06/30/2014).\nHeart rhythm disorders are major causes of mortality and morbidity globally. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most \ncommon heart rhythm disturbance and the prevalence is exponentially  growing1. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) \naccounts for over 300,000 deaths annually in the US.  Experimental2,3 and observational studies have suggested \nthat the intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 FA) might lower the risk of ventricular arrhyth-\nmias and  SCD4,5 and vitamin D deficiency and/or PTH excess has been associated with increased  SCD6\u20139, whereas \nthe observational data regarding atrial arrhythmias are mixed for both.OPEN\n1Research Unit of Internal Medicine, Medical Research Center Oulu, Oulu University Hospital and University of \nOulu, Oulu, Finland. 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Epidemiological Cardiology Research Center, Section On \nCardiovascular Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston- Salem, NC, USA. 3Department of Cardiology, \nSmidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 127 South San Vincente Blvd., AHSP 3100, Los Angeles, \nCA 90048, USA. 4Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, \nHarvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. 5Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, \nMassachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. 6Department of Epidemiology, \nHarvard T.H.

With respect to AF, we recently reported that omega-3 \nFA and/or vitamin D3 supplementation resulted in no significant difference in the risk of incident AF over a \nmedian follow up of over 5.3\u00a0years in the VITAL  trial10; however, a small increased risk of AF could not be \nexcluded. In contrast, three recent randomized trials testing various higher dose formulations of omega-3 FA \nfound significantly increased risks of AF in participants randomized to active therapy versus  placebo11\u201313. When \ncombined in meta-analysis with 3 additional trials of long term omega-3 FA supplementation, omega-3 FA \nsupplementation was associated with a significant increased risk of AF compared with placebo even at lower \ndosages of 1\u00a0g per  day14.\nThe mechanisms underlying this potential increased risk of AF and lower SCD risk associated with omega-3 \nfatty acid supplementation are unclear, although cellular electrophysiologic and autonomic mechanisms have \nbeen  postulated2. Several parameters on the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) represent potential intermediate \nphenotypes for heart rhythm disorders, and thus may provide clues regarding potential mechanisms of  action15\u201317. \nOmega-3 FA intake has been favorably associated with several of these parameters in observational  studies18, \nhowever, randomized trial data are lacking. Although Vitamin D supplementation is less well studied with respect \nto heart rhythm disorders, observational studies have found consistent associations between vitamin D deficiency \nand clinical conditions predisposing to AF and SCD, most notably including  hypertension19 and heart  failure20.\nThe large-scale randomized placebo-controlled VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) primary prevention \n trial21,22 provided a unique opportunity to test the effect of supplementation with omega-3 FA and vitamin D3 \non ECG parameters. In a pre-specified sub-study of the VITAL Rhythm  trial10, serial ECGs were performed at \nbaseline and 2\u00a0years after randomization in a subset of 911 participants. Thus, in this present study, we report \nthe effect of both interventions on a variety of pre-specified ECG characteristics previously associated with AF \nor  SCD17,23.\nResults\nThe clinical characteristics and electrocardiographic features of study groups at baseline are presented in Tables\u00a0 1 \nand 2, respectively. At baseline, those individuals randomized to active EPA + DHA treatment had significantly \nhigher BMI (p  = 0.023, Table\u00a0 1), lower resting heart rate (p  = 0.033, Table\u00a0 2), and higher Cornell voltages (p  = 0.049, \nTable\u00a0 2) than those receiving the placebo treatment. Individuals randomized to vitamin D3 treatment had sta -\ntistically lower diastolic blood pressure (p  = 0.041, Table\u00a0 1) and lower mean arterial pressure (p  = 0.045, Table\u00a0 1), \ncompared to those in the placebo group.

Baseline levels of EPA  + DHA and vitamin D also did not vary by baseline \ntreatment assignment.\nEffect of EPA + DHA supplementation on ECG measures (Table 3). Table\u00a0 3 illustrates the change \nin analyzed ECG variables within and between treatment groups between baseline and year 2 for those rand-\nomized to EPA + DHA and placebo. At year 2, individuals receiving active EPA + DHA treatment demonstrated \na significant net increase in PR interval duration. The PR interval increased in both groups, but to a significantly \ngreater extent in those assigned to EPA + DHA (difference in net change, 2.68\u00a0ms; 95% CI 0.82 to 4.54; nominal \np = 0.005). In contrast, the P wave duration decreased in both groups, but to a lesser extent in those randomized \nto EPA + DHA; resulting in a significant positive net change of 2.07\u00a0 ms (95% CI, 0.20\u20133.93; p = 0.03) in the \ncomparison between randomized treatment groups. The P-wave amplitude also decreased in those assigned to \nplacebo but remained stable in the EPA + DHA group; resulting in a borderline significant net change between \ngroups (0.004\u00a0mV , 95% CI 0.000\u20130.007). Furthermore, EPA + DHA supplementation was associated with a sig-\nnificant borderline net positive change in the logarithm of RMSSD (net change of 8.84%, 95% CI 0.41\u201317.97% \np = 0.040). There was no significant change observed in P terminal force (p = 0.66), QRS duration (p = 0.66), \nQTc durations (p = 0.74 with Framingham formula and p = 0.68 with the Fredericia formula), Cornell voltage \n(p = 0.44), resting heart rate (p = 0.87) or SDNN (p = 0.18). These results were not materially altered in models \nadditionally controlling for antihypertensive, cholesterol lowering medications, or baseline imbalances in heart \nrate and Cornell voltage (data not shown).\nIn secondary stratified analyses, results were similar for all ECG variables among those who reported fish \nintake above or below the median (1.5 per week). In analyses stratified by baseline EPA + DHA levels, there \nwas nominal evidence for effect modification of the treatment effect on the PR interval. Among those with \nbaseline levels below the median (<  2.7%), the difference in the net change in the PR interval was 4.87\u00a0ms (95% \nCI: 1.97\u20137.77) in the active versus the placebo group. In comparison, the difference in the net change was only \n0.89\u00a0ms (95% CI: \u2212\u00a01.52\u20133.31) in those with EPA  + DHA levels > 2.7% (P , interaction  = 0.039). Tests for interac-\ntion were not significant for any of the other ECG variables. In post-hoc analyses, change in EPA  + DHA level \nwas significantly associated with change in PR interval in the study population. For each percentage increase in \nblood level of EPA + DHA, the PR interval increased by 1.55\u00a0ms (p  < 0.001). When the change in EPA + DHA level \nwas added to the multivariable model evaluating the EPA + DHA treatment effect, the covariate for the treatment \neffect was significantly attenuated and became non-significant; whereas the change in blood level of EPA + DHA \nremained significantly associated with PR interval ( p = 0.01).\nEffect of Vitamin D supplementation on ECG measures (Table 4). Table\u00a0 4 illustrates the changes in \nanalyzed ECG variables between baseline and year 2 in those randomized to Vitamin D and placebo. There were \nno statistically significant changes observed between the vitamin D active and placebo treatment groups in any \nof the investigated ECG measures except for borderline significant difference in Cornell voltage. At year 2, the \nCornell voltage increased to a lesser extent in the subjects receiving active vitamin D treatment as compared to \nthose in the placebo-group (p = 0.044).

In secondary stratified analyses, these were no significant interactions for \nvitamin D intake or vitamin D levels for any of the ECG variables.\nDiscussion\nIn this randomized controlled trial, supplementation with omega-3 FA (1\u00a0g of EPA  + DHA per day) caused sev-\neral nominally significant changes in ECG parameters over 2-years of follow-up. The PR interval significantly \nincreased and the P-wave duration decreased to a lesser extent in patients randomized to EPA  + DHA as com -\npared to placebo. There were also borderline significant net positive differences in change in P-wave amplitude \nand logarithm of RMSSD in the Omega-3 FA supplementation arm. In the Vitamin D supplementation arm, \nthe Cornell mV , a measure of LVH, increased to a lesser degree than what was observed in the placebo arm. The \nremainder of the ECG parameters tested did not change with treatment assignment. These observations are novel \nand provide mechanistic insight on the potential electrophysiologic impact of these commonly used supplements.\nEpidemiological data have long provided evidence for an inverse relationship between fish consumption, \nomega-3 FA, and  SCD24\u201327; and there is an extensive body of basic and experimental data suggesting these \nagents have a multitude of effects on cardiac  electrophysiology2,18. In cross sectional observational studies and \nmeta-analyses of smaller randomized trials, omega-3 intake and supplementation has been associated with lower \nheart  rate28, longer PR  interval18, and shorter QT interval on  ECGs18,28, as well as indices of heart rate variabil -\nity associated with vagal  activity29.

The effects on PR interval and vagal tone have also \nbeen observed in experimental  studies30. These observations are clinically intriguing as measures of heart rate \nvariability and augmented vagal tone have been inversely associated with SCD and VF in experimental and \nobservational  studies31. However, the relationship between vagal tone and AF is more mixed, with some studies \nsuggesting  benefit32 while at the same time, subsets of AF are known to be vagally induced. Unlike these prior \nstudies, we did not find any significant effects on heart rate or QTc interval, or any other ECG parameters.\nIn secondary analyses, we found that the effect of EPA  + DHA supplementation on the PR interval was modi -\nfied by baseline level of EPA + DHA, such that the change in the PR interval was greater in those with EPA + DHA \nlevel below the median and the effect was not significant in those above the median, suggesting there may be a \nthreshold effect. Also, we observed that change in EPA + DHA level was strongly associated with change in the PR \ninterval, and when included in the same multivariable model, appeared to mediate the treatment effect consistent \nwith a potential causal association. However, these findings have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons \nand should be interpreted with caution and considered hypothesis generating.\nThe PR interval is not only reflective of vagal tone but is also representative of atrial and AV nodal conduction. \nOmega-3 FA supplementation also had a statistically significant effect on P-wave duration, another measure of \nintra-atrial conduction. These findings suggest that omega-3 FAs might slow intra-atrial conduction, which might \nin turn increase the vulnerability to AF, offering a potential explanation for the recently reported increase in \nAF risk in randomized trials testing omega-3 FA  supplementation14.

These data, in combination, \nunderscore the importance of carefully balancing risks and benefits when prescribing fish oil supplementation.\nFor vitamin D supplementation, we found a marginal protective association between randomized treatment \nwith Vitamin D and progression of LVH on ECG at 2\u00a0years, as Cornell voltage increased in both treatment \narms, but to a significantly lesser extent in those treated with Vitamin D. These findings are consistent with \nexperimental studies demonstrating direct antihypertrophic actions of the Vitamin D receptor signaling system \nin  cardiomyocytes34 and prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy by vitamin D analogs independent of blood \npressure in spontaneously hypertensive  rats35. In a recently published echocardiographic study performed in \nthis same  population36, a non-significant trend toward less increase in left ventricular mass at two years was \nobserved in the vitamin D as compared to the placebo arms; although development of LVH as defined by LV \nmass was not specifically  examined36. With respect to other ECG variables, prior observational studies reported \nassociations between Vitamin D deficiency and prolonged P wave duration, PR  interval37 and repolarization \n indices38,39; however, we did not observe any clinically significant changes in these ECG variables with active \nsupplementation for vitamin D.\nStrengths of this study include the blinded randomized controlled trial design, sample size, a meaningful \nproportion of African American enrollees, and high rates of adherence with study medications. There are also \nseveral limitations to these data. First, it should be acknowledged that this trial tested one specific preparation \nand dose of omega-3 FA and vitamin D3; and therefore, dose-dependent effects may have gone undetected. Sec-\nond, we only investigated common, clinically used ECG measures previously associated with arrhythmic events. \nThus, it is possible that we might have missed changes in other less standard measures of cardiac conduction, \nrepolarization and/or electrical heterogeneity. Third, follow-up ECGs were only available at one time-point (year \n2), limiting the conclusions that can be derived from the data. In particular, we may have missed changes in the \nECG reflecting structural alterations that might have required a longer duration of treatment. Fourth, we can\u2019t \nrule out repeatability issues with the possibility of normal fluctuation of the ECG measures over  time40. Finally, \nalthough the examination of each of the ECG measures was pre-specified for each study agent, we cannot rule \nout the possibility of a false positive result due to multiple testing.\nIn conclusion, two years of treatment with omega-3 FA supplementation (1\u00a0g EPA/DHA per day) resulted \nin changes on the ECG that are potentially reflective of heightened vagal tone and/or slowing of intraatrial and \nAV conduction; whereas, treatment with Vitamin D3 (2000\u00a0IU per day) may have exhibited an antihypertrophic \neffect. These results suggest that these commonly used supplements may have subtle effects on cardiac electro -\nphysiology even at low dosages which may influence, both favorably and adversely, the propensity toward cardiac \narrhythmias. Whether such subtle effects could ultimately impact risk for arrhythmias in clinical practice is \nunknown and requires further study.\nMethods\nThe VITAL Rhythm study is a substudy of the VITAL trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, \ndesigned to test effects of vitamin D3 [2000\u00a0IU (50 ug)/day] and omega-3 FAs  (Omacor\u00ae 1\u00a0g/day; 460\u00a0mg of EPA \nand 380\u00a0mg of DHA) upon incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The trial consented, enrolled, and \nfollowed 25,871 randomized participants over a median of 5.3\u00a0  years41. Briefly, nationwide recruitment of men \nage 50\u00a0years and women age 55\u00a0years began in March 2011. More than 20% African American enrollment was \nobtained. In this 2 \u00d7 2 factorial trial, 25% of participants were randomized to each arm. The primary results on \ncardiovascular and cancer endpoints along with the report of the side-effect profile of these agents have been \nreported  previously21,22\nThe VITAL and VITAL Rhythm study are registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01169259; NCT02178410). All \nparticipants provided written informed consent. Experimental protocols and methods utilized for both studies \nwere approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. Before randomization, \nparticipants completed a questionnaire assessing demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Participants also \ncompleted a modified food frequency questionnaire that assessed dietary, fortified, and supplemental sources of \nvitamin D and omega-3 FA-intake. Participants agreed to agree to limit consumption of supplemental vitamin D \nand calcium to no more than 800\u00a0IU/d and 1200\u00a0mg/d, respectively, from all supplemental sources and to forgo \nthe use of fish-oil supplements during the trial. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 2-years of follow-\nup, and plasma phospholipid omega-3 fatty acids (EPA + DHA as a percentage of total plasma phospholipid fatty \nacids) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays were measured in stored samples using liquid chromatography-\ntandem mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (L-MS/MS) by Quest Diagnostics. The trial protocol has been \ndescribed elsewhere in  detail41,42.\nThe ECG study was performed in a subcohort of 1054 VITAL participants who lived within driving distance \nof Boston, Massachusetts and participated in detailed in-person health assessments at the Center and Transla-\ntional Science center (CTSC) at baseline and year 2 of the trial. The CTSC cohort was somewhat younger and \nhealthier than the overall study population, with lower prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, current \nsmoking, and physical  inactivity41. The baseline visits took place between January 2012 and March 2014, and the \ntwo-year follow-up visits occurred between October 2014 and July 2016. ECGs were obtained on 1034 of 1054 \nparticipants (98%) at baseline and 959 out of 964 (99%) at year 2.\nDuring each visit, three digital 10-s consecutive ECGs were obtained using GE MAC 1200 system (GE, \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). The first ECG was designated as the main ECG and all electrocardiographic \nmeasures were taken from this ECG. The two additional ECGs were used in the determination of two heart \nrate variability (HRV) measures (SDNN and rMSSD) which were averaged over the 3 ECGs. ECGs were trans -\nmitted electronically to the Epidemiological Cardiology Research Center (EPICARE) (Wake Forest School of \nMedicine, Winston-Salem, NC) for central reading. ECGs were automatically processed, after visual inspection \n7\nVol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |        (2023) 13:11454  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-38344-x\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/for technical errors and inadequate quality using the 2001 version of the GE Marquette 12-SL program (GE, \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). ECG abnormalities were classified using the Minnesota ECG Classification, and \nthe automatically measured durations and amplitudes of each segment of the ECG waveform in each lead were \nused to calculate the ECG markers of interest.\nParticipants with poor quality or missing ECG data at baseline and at year 2 or who had atrial fibrillation, \natrial flutter, 2nd and 3rd degree AV block, WPW-syndrome or cardiac pacing on ECG were excluded from \nthe analysis. After exclusions, a total of 911 subjects formed the study population for the current investigation.\nFor the purpose of this study, several ECG indices were prespecified for analyses according to their prior asso-\nciation with either AF or SCD in observational  studies43,44. The pre-selected measured included R-R  interval45,46, \nPR  duration15,43, P-wave  indices44,47 (axis, amplitude, duration, area, terminal force), QRS  duration43,48,49, QT \n interval43,49,50,  LVH43,51, and heart rate variability (HRV)32,52. P wave duration, P wave amplitude and QRS dura-\ntion measures were defined as maximum values across all 12 leads. QT interval was corrected for heart rate \nwith two formulas: the Framingham linear regression formula [QT + 0.154 (1\u201360/heart rate), and the Fredericia \nformula [QT (heart rate/60)1/3]. Cornell voltage criteria was selected to represent left ventricular hypertrophy. \nTwo short term time domain HRV indices were selected for analyses: the standard deviation of all filtered RR \nintervals over the length of the recording (SDNN); and the root mean square of the difference of successive RRs \n(RMSSD). These measures were obtained from a 10-s ECG that were processed digitally.\nWe examined the association between randomized treatment with omega-3 FA and ECG parameters over \ntime (repeated measurements at baseline and year 2). Distributions of continuous ECG variables were tested \nfor normality and P values were generated using two-sample t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, or chi-squared analysis, \ndepending on the distribution. Natural logarithm transformations were performed to improve normality as \nappropriate, and effects are presented as net percent changes for these variables.\nFor each continuous ECG interval, we used a linear mixed-effects repeated measures model with a time by \ntreatment interaction to estimate the net changes over time between the randomized groups. The 95% confidence \nintervals (CIs) and nominal P  values for the main intervention effects were estimated for changes in those indices \nbetween baseline and 2\u00a0years of follow up within each group. Treatment effect models were adjusted for age, \nsex, race, and covariates not fully balanced by randomization (BMI and blood pressure at baseline). Secondary \nanalyses stratified according to the median of baseline fish intake, EPA + DHA blood levels, vitamin D intake, and \nVitamin D blood levels were performed for the respective treatment effect, and a Z-test was used to compare the \n2 subgroups as a test for interaction. Post-hoc analyses were also performed that used linear regression to explore \nassociations between change in EPA  + DHA levels and change in the ECG variables. Statistical significance was \ninterpreted from 95% CIs excluding zero and 2-tailed P  values  < 0.05. SAS version 9.4 was used for all analyses.\nData availability\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article [and its supplementary \ninformation files].\nReceived: 28 October 2022; Accepted: 6 July 2023\nReferences\n 1.
