Conventional preservation solutions\nsuch as histidine\u2013tryptophan\u2013ketoglutarate (HTK) solution, Phosphate-Buffer Solution (PBS), or\nsodium chloride 0.9% has been shown to be inadequate in preserving vascular physiological function\nafter 3 days of cold storage. This study aimed to evaluate whether adenosine and lidocaine (AL)\nin a modified Krebs\u2013Henseleit (KH) solution can preserve the function and histological structure\nof rat aortic rings after 6 days. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five aortic rings from male Wistar rats\n(200\u2013300 g ) were harvested and immediately immersed in one of the assigned cold preservation\nsolutions: standard KH, modified KH (mod KH) with lower calcium (Ca2+) and higher magnesium\ncontent (Mg2+) with or without adenosine and lidocaine (mod KH-AL), and modified KH with AL,\ninsulin, and melatonin (Mod KH-ALMI). The contraction and relaxation function of the aortic rings\nwere examined using an isometric force transducer after 6 days of cold preservation. Hematoxylin\nand eosin staining were used to analyze the rings\u2019 histological structure. Results: Vascular contraction\nand relaxation functions were severely affected after a 6-day cold storage period in standard KH.\nModifying the KH solution by reducing the Ca2+and increasing the Mg2+levels greatly recovered\nthe vessel functions. The addition of AL or ALMI to the modified KH did not further recover\nvascular contractility. However, only the addition of AL to the modified KH increased the ACh-\ninduced relaxation at 6 days when compared to the conventional KH, suggesting that endothelium\npreservation is improved. From histological analysis, it was found that the addition of AL but not\nALMI further improved the endothelial lining and the structure of the elastic membrane layers of\nthe preserved vessels after 6 days of cold preservation. Conclusions: The addition of AL to low\ncalcium-high magnesium KH solution significantly enhanced endothelial preservation and improved\nendothelial-induced relaxation of preserved vessels after 6 days of cold storage.\nKeywords: adenosine; lidocaine; aorta; preservation solution\n1. Introduction\nSmall-diameter vessel grafts are regularly used in cardiovascular surgery to recon-\nstruct dysfunctional or damaged blood vessels [ 1]. After being harvested, the vascular\nrings are often stored in an anti-spasm solution for several hours during the cardiovascular\nsurgery [ 2], but prolonged storage for up to several days may require cold storage in a\npreservation solution [ 3]. The main problem of vascular preservation is the maintenance of\nvessel graft quality and function following prolonged storage [4]. Cold storage in conven-\ntional preservation solution, such as histidine\u2013tryptophan\u2013ketoglutarate (HTK) solution,\nPhosphate-Buffer Solution (PBS), or sodium chloride 0.9%, has been shown to be inadequate\nMedicina 2024 ,60, 1284. https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina60081284 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/medicina\nMedicina 2024 ,60, 1284 2 of 13\nin preserving vascular contractility and relaxation after 3 days of storage [ 4]. Meanwhile,\nthe standard cold preservation solution, Krebs\u2013Henseleit, has been shown to preserve the\ncontractility function of aortic grafts after 48 h of storage, but does not sufficiently preserve\naortic relaxation function (30% loss of endothelial-dependent relaxation) [5].\nThe composition of the preservation solution plays pivotal roles in decelerating cell\ndeath mechanisms during cold storage. Preservation efficacy is limited by how each element\ncontributes to halting molecular pathways that may progress to ischemic-/hypoxic-induced\ncellular injury. The constituents of the preservation solution are mostly adjusted to target\nspecific pH, osmolality, osmolarity, nutrition, and often, antioxidative agents [ 6] to mimic\nthe most ideal environment for the preserved tissues [ 7]. This could be varied due to\ncellular heterogeneity and organ complexity [8].\nEndothelial injury is believed to be the key factor in vascular dysfunction follow-\ning ischemic preservation, as endothelial cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress [ 9]. The\ndeterioration of endothelial function can manifest as vascular occlusion, the increased\nrisk of atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia, and reduced graft patency [ 10]. There-\nfore, maintaining endothelial viability during the cold preservation period is essential for\nimproving the physiological function of vessel grafts and reducing morbidity following\nrevascularization.\nAdenosine is a well-recognized vasodilator with anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic,\nand cardioprotective properties [ 11,12]. Lidocaine is another vasoactive agent that offers\nanti-inflammatory and oxidative stress-prevention properties [ 13]. Lidocaine has also been\nshown to protect aortic endothelial and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) function [ 14,15]. As\na local anesthetic agent, lidocaine also has a membrane-stabilizing effect that may preserve\nvascular reactivity [ 16]. Adenosine and lidocaine (AL) addition has been demonstrated to\nelicit superior anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and antiarrhythmic effects when compared\nwith either drug alone [ 17\u201319]. AL combination with or without melatonin and insulin in\nKrebs\u2013Henseleit solution with low Ca2+and high Mg2+(modified KH) has been shown to\nimprove the function of isolated rat hearts as compared with the traditional preservation\nsolutions Celsior or HTK following 8 h static cold storage [ 20]. Therefore, we hypothesized\nthat this AL addition to a modified KH solution would improve the preservation ability of\nthe solution on vascular function, and with melatonin and insulin addition would even\nfurther enhance the preservation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AL\nin a modified KH preservation solution, with and without melatonin and insulin, on rat\naortic ring function and histology after 6 days of static cold preservation.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Chemicals\nAdenosine, melatonin, and insulin were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Singapore).\nLidocaine HCl was obtained from Phapros TBK (Indonesia). All the salts used to prepare\nthe Krebs\u2013Henseleit solution were purchased from Merck (Singapore). All the solutions\nwere prepared fresh daily before harvesting the aortic rings and stored in a refrigerator at\n4\u25e6C before starting the experiment.\n2.2. Preservation Solution Compositions\n\u2022 Krebs\u2013Henseleit (KH): 118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH 2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl 2,\n1.2 mM MgCl 2, 25 mM NaHCO 3, 0.03 mM Na-EDTA, and 11 mM glucose.\n\u2022 Modified KH: 118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH 2PO4, 0.22 mM CaCl 2, 2.6 mM\nMgCl 2, 25 mM NaHCO 3, 0.03 mM Na-EDTA, and 11 mM glucose.\n\u2022 Modified KH + AL: modified KH, 0.4 mM adenosine, and 1 mM lidocaine.\n\u2022 Modified KH +ALMI: modified KH, 0.4 mM adenosine, 1 mM lidocaine, 0.1 mM\nmelatonin, and 0.01 IU/mL insulin.\nMelatonin and insulin were incorporated into the AL solution for the following reasons:\n(1) Melatonin has free radical scavenging and antioxidative actions. Due to its lipophilic\nnature, melatonin can easily enter the cell, reach organelles and the nucleus, and protect\nMedicina 2024 ,60, 1284 3 of 13\nthem against oxidative damage [ 21,22]. (2) Insulin is a potent K+influx enhancer, which may\nhave the ability to restore intracellular K+levels and initiate membrane hyperpolarization,\nas observed in skeletal muscle [ 23]. Additionally, insulin can improve glucose uptake and\nutilization, hence, improving ATP production.\n2.3. Animal Preparation\nThirty-five male Wistar rats (200\u2013300 g) were cared for in a laboratory with a 12 h light\u2013\ndark cycle. The rats were provided with food and water ad libitum. All the animal protocols\nwere performed based on the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were\ngranted ethical clearance by Hasanuddin University (224/UN4.6.4.5.31/PP36/2022). The\nrats were anesthetized with ether inhalation before performing the surgical protocols.\n2.4. Aortic Ring Preparation\nThe rat thoracic aorta vessels were harvested and immediately immersed in cold KH\nsolution. The vessel segments were carefully cleaned from the surrounding adipose and\nconnective tissue and were cut in 3 mm length rings as previously described in a study by\nArsyad [ 18]. The fresh aortic rings, serving as the control group, were directly mounted\non small stainless-steel triangular stirrups in an organ bath filled with KH solution and\nrewarmed to 37\u25e6C for vessel function analysis. Meanwhile, the aortic segments assigned\nto the other groups were stored for 6 days in one of the following cold solutions: Krebs\u2013\nHenseleit (KH), modified KH (low Ca2+/high Mg2+), modified KH with adenosine and\nlidocaine (KH + AL), and modified KH with adenosine, lidocaine, melatonin, and insulin\n(KH + ALMI). Based on a previous study on porcine, arterial wall structure may deteriorate\nafter six days of preservation in cold storage using a standard solution [ 24]. The solution\ncontaining melatonin was covered with aluminum foil during storage to prevent oxidation.\n2.5. Vessel Function Analysis\nThe physiological function of the aortic rings was measured using an isometric force\ntransducer (ADInstruments) coupled with a data acquisition system and software (ADIn-\nstruments Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia) as described in a previous study by Arsyad [ 18].\nApart from the control aortic rings, all the other rings were stored in the assigned cold solu-\ntion for 6 days. Following a 6-day static cold period, the aortic rings were gently rewarmed\nto 37\u25e6C in an organ bath containing the modified KH solution (pH 7.4) and constantly\naerated with 95% O 2and 5% CO 2. After 15 min of equilibration period (zero tension),\nthe rings were vertically mounted on a small stainless stirrup that was connected to an\nisometric force transducer. The ring tension was manually adjusted to 1.5 g for a duration\nof 60 min [ 25]. The contraction was induced by norepinephrine (0.3 \u00b5M) and a high-\npotassium saline solution (60 mM KCl) to observe the receptor- and non-receptor-induced\ncontractile responses.\nAcetylcholine (ACh) and sodium-nitroprusside (NO donor) relaxation effects were\ntested to assess the endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation, respectively. In\nthe presence of endothelium, ACh induces an increase in intracellular calcium concentration\nand leads to the production and release of NO and prostacyclin (PGI 2) in endothelial cells\nin addition to the opening of K+channels, which in turn induces vascular smooth muscle\ncell relaxation [ 26]. SNP was utilized as an endothelium-independent vasodilator due to its\nprimarily direct effect on smooth muscle cells by releasing NO into the vascular smooth\nmuscle cell without requiring enzymatic conversion [ 27]. At the end of each experiment,\nthe rings were maximally dilated with 100 \u00b5M papaverine to confirm the viability of the\nvessels and to obtain the maximum relaxation value. The vessel function measurements\nwere described in detail in our previous studies [13,25].\n2.6. Vessel Histopathological Analysis\nAt the end of each preservation period, the aortic ring was fixed with 10% ( v/v)\nformalin and processed to obtain vascular histological slides. The slides were then stained\nMedicina 2024 ,60, 1284 4 of 13\nwith hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological analysis and assessed under a light\nmicroscope (Olympus) by experienced pathologists. The endothelial cells were identified\nas a single layer showing a single layer of squamous-fusiform cells lining the lumen of the\nvessels [ 28]. The degree of damage was also considered. The criteria of histopathological\nvessel damage included elastic membrane ablation, endothelial denudation, and tunica\nintima layer degradation [ 29]. The severity of vascular degeneration was scored according\nto a study by Kongpol, et al. (2020): score 0, no change or minimal vascular degeneration;\nscore 1, vascular degeneration observed in less than 25% of the observed area; and score 2,\nvascular degeneration observed in more than 25% of the observed area [ 28].

At the end of each ex-\nperiment, the rings were maximally dila ted with 100 \u00b5M papaverine to con \ufb01rm the via-\nbility of the vessels and to obtain the maximum relaxation value. The vessel function measurements were described in deta il in our previous studies [13,25].  \n2.6.

The power of statistical analysis was \ndetermined by a G*Power program (version 3.1.9.6).

NE- and KCl-Induced Aortic Vasoconstrictive Responses with Di \ufb00erent Preservation \nSolutions \nThe freshly harvested aortic ring (control) produced vasoconstriction after the ad-\nministration of KCl and NE, wi th contractility responses of 0.80 \u00b1 0.42 and 1.31 \u00b1 0.07 g \ntension, respectively (Figure 2). After 6 days of storage in the KH solution at 4 \u00b0C, the \naortic rings produced only 0.39 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.62 \u00b1 0.08 g tension in response to KCl and NE, \nrespectively; less than 50% of the contractio n produced by the freshly harvested aortic \nrings (controls). Di \ufb00ering from the rings preserved in the standard KH solution, when the \nsolution was modi \ufb01ed by decreasing the concentration of Ca\n2+ and increasing Mg2+ (mod-\ni\ufb01ed KH solution), the contraction of the aortic rings was maintained and was equivalent \nFigure 1.

Results\n3.1.NE- and KCl-Induced Aortic Vasoconstrictive Responses with Different Preservation Solutions\nThe freshly harvested aortic ring (control) produced vasoconstriction after the ad-\nministration of KCl and NE, with contractility responses of 0.80 \u00b10.42 and 1.31\u00b10.07 g\ntension, respectively (Figure 2). After 6 days of storage in the KH solution at 4\u25e6C, the\naortic rings produced only 0.39 \u00b10.08 and 0.62 \u00b10.08 g tension in response to KCl and\nNE, respectively; less than 50% of the contraction produced by the freshly harvested aortic\nrings (controls). Differing from the rings preserved in the standard KH solution, when the\nsolution was modified by decreasing the concentration of Ca2+and increasing Mg2+(modi-\nfied KH solution), the contraction of the aortic rings was maintained and was equivalent to\n~80% of the control aortic rings. In this group, the aortic contractions with KCL and NE\nwere 0.865 \u00b10.13 and 1.07 \u00b10.19 g tension, respectively.\nMeanwhile, preservation in the modified KH solution with AL and ALMI sustained\naortic contraction following the administration of KCl and NE at 84% and 78%, respectively.\nThese results were not significantly different from the aortic contraction response of the\nrings stored in the modified KH solution only (78%). This indicated that the modification of\nKH by lowering the concentration of Ca2+and increasing Mg2+was effective in improving\nthe contractile function of the aortic smooth muscle with or without the addition of AL or\nALMI (Figure 2).\nMedicina 2024 ,60, 1284 5 of 13\nMedicina 2024 , 60, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 13 \n \n to ~80% of the control aortic rings.

Ach- and NO-Induced Aortic Vasorelaxation Responses in Di \ufb00erent Preservation Solutions \nTo examine the endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilative function, the \nrelaxation response to acetylcholine (ACh) and nitric oxide (NO) donor (sodium nitro-\nprusside) of the aortic rings stored in the preservation solutions was measured and com-\npared with papaverine. The relaxation response  is formulated as a percent of the relaxa-\ntion to 100 \u00b5M papaverine. \nThe freshly harvested aortic ring (control) produced a relaxation response to Ach \nwith the percentages of 3.8 \u00b1 1.5%, 8.6 \u00b1 2.9%, 36.7 \u00b1 15.27%, 58.9 \u00b1 12.09%, 70.8 \u00b1 8.08%, \n72.4 \u00b1 6.51%, and 64.4 \u00b1 8.87% for the ACh concentrations of 10\u22129, 10\u22128, 10\u22127, 10\u22126, 10\u22125, 10\u22124, \nand 10\u22123 M, respectively (Figure 3).

Discussion\nMaintaining the physiological and biochemical properties of the preserved vessel\ngrafts is of importance during vessel banking to prevent dysfunctional vessels following\nrevascularization [ 30]. Tissue or organ preservation solutions mostly contain some basic\ncomponents such as impermeants (glucose, raffinose, mannitol, lactobionate, etc.) and\nelectrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, bicarbonates,\nsulfates, etc.) to provide proper osmolality and pH in the solution. Currently, commercial\npreservation solutions are often enriched with antioxidants, nutrients, and specific additives\n(insulin, antibiotics) that may protect against pathological molecular responses induced by\nischemia and hypoxia [7,8].\nIn this study, adenosine and lidocaine, with or without insulin and melatonin, were\nincorporated in a KH solution to improve its preservation efficacy during prolonged\nstorage. It is shown that after 6 days of cold preservation, the contractility function of\nthe aortic rings stored in the standard KH was significantly reduced in response to NE\nand KCl, respectively. This finding confirmed that the standard KH solution failed to\nprevent impairment in the adrenergic receptor-stimulated and ion channel-dependent\ncontraction of the aortic rings [ 31]. However, this impairment can be improved by reducing\nthe Ca2+/Mg2+ratio of the solution with or without the addition of AL and ALMI.\nIngemansson et al. (1995) reported that standard KH may restore around ~90% of\nvascular contractility within 36 h of preservation. The maintenance of aortic contractile\nfunction was thought to be derived from the calcium content [ 32]. Similarly, the addition\nof Ca2+(1.5 mM) to calcium-free solutions such as UW, Perfadex, and Euro-Collins so-\nlution also contributed to the recovery of aortic contractile function after storage for 24\nto36 h [33,34] . However, following prolonged storage (144 h), a normocalcemic solution\n(1.5\u20132.5 mM Ca2+), as in the standard KH, was found unfavorable for maintaining vascular\ncontractile function.\nIt is widely recognized that Ca2+ions play a crucial role in the regulation of cell death.\nAn extracellular fluid with high levels of Ca2+ions can trigger the influx of Ca2+ions into\ncells, leading to intracellular Ca2+overload and ultimately inducing cell apoptosis [ 35].\nTherefore, reducing the concentration of Ca2+in a solution may mitigate the negative effects\nof Ca2+ions. Additionally, high levels of Mg2+ions have been found to counteract the\nharmful effects of elevated Ca2+ion levels in cells. A study demonstrated that Mg2+acts\nas a specific type of Ca2+channel antagonist in VSM [ 36]. Furthermore, another study\nrevealed that the reperfusion of the heart with high Mg2+levels reduces mitochondrial\nCa2+overload and helps maintain mitochondrial ATP production capacity. This study also\nindicated that lowering calcium content in the presence of high magnesium leads to better\nprotection [ 37]. These findings suggest that decreasing Ca2+concentration and increasing\nMg2+concentration in a preservation solution may yield promising results in prolonging\ncell survival.\nLowering the Ca2+concentration to 0.2 mM (in addition to increasing the Mg2+content)\nin the KH solution not only increased contractility response, but also was superior in\nenhancing the vasodilation response to ACh and NO. The vasodilation response to ACh\nand NO represents endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation function [ 38]. In\nthis study, aortic preservation in the standard KH caused 63% and 29% loss of endothelium-\nMedicina 2024 ,60, 1284 10 of 13\ndependent and -independent responses, respectively. These results support those of the\nprevious studies by Ingemansson and colleagues, who showed that although standard KH\ncould recover rat infrarenal aortic contractile function, the maintenance of the relaxation\nfunction was unsuccessful [ 32\u201334]. This finding implies that a high concentration of\nCa2+is harmful to endothelial function, and that decreasing the Ca2+and increasing the\nMg2+concentration is valuable not only in preventing the loss of endothelial-dependent\nrelaxation, but also in maintaining endothelium-independent vasodilation.\nAfter 6 days of cold storage, endothelial detachment was observed in the rings pre-\nserved in the standard KH solution (Figure 5B), in which the endothelial detachment scores\npredominated. Usually, endothelial cell shedding occurs within 48 h of preservation, and\nmainly necrotic cells disappear from the vessels; in this case, fewer necrotic cells were\nobserved after 6 days [ 29]. Since an intact luminal endothelial barrier is imperative to graft\npatency [ 39], the addition of AL, with or without melatonin and insulin, in a modified\nKH solution (lower Ca2+/Mg2+ratio) may not only improve the preservation of the vessel\narchitecture but also potentially improve vascular graft patency and function.\nIt has been shown that the AL solution significantly increased endothelial nitric oxide\nsynthase (eNOS) dimerization, maintained the endothelial glycocalyx, and promoted pro-\nsurvival signaling as seen in coronary cardiac grafts [ 40]. During cold storage, the graft\nshall experience the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cellular stores and the\ninhibition of Na+/K+ATPase, leading to a drop in the intracellular K+levels and membrane\ndepolarization, increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 41]. Lidocaine,\nthrough its activation of mitochondrial K ATPchannels, was able to diminish cytokine-\ninduced injury in endothelial and VSM cells [ 14]. In combination, AL has been shown to\ndecrease oxidative injury and intracellular calcium overload in preserved cardiac grafts [ 40].\nThe protective effects of AL on endothelial cells may be linked to its capacity to restore\nand protect the endothelial glycocalyx [ 40,42]. Adenosine in preservation solution may\nallow the rapid regeneration of energy (ATP) [ 7] while providing other benefits such as the\ninhibition of endothelial inflammation [ 43]. The membrane-stabilizing effect of lidocaine\nmay protect against cellular reactivity. Moreover, pretreatment with lidocaine has been\nshown to provide protection against ROS-induced endothelial dysfunction in rabbit aortic\nrings [44].\nAdditionally, adenosine and lidocaine may independently influence the cellular path-\nways responsible for vascular contractility and relaxation. It was found that through the\nA2a receptor, adenosine elicits vasodilation by releasing endothelial NO and stimulat-\ning the opening of VSM K ATPchannels [ 45] whilst lidocaine inhibits Ca2+entry through\nvoltage- and receptor-gated Ca2+channels, and reduces Ca2+release from intracellular\nstores, thereby reducing the intracellular free Ca2+that is necessary for the contraction of\nVSM [46].\nMeanwhile, the addition of melatonin and insulin as hormone and trophic factors\nmay act as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic agents [ 47]. Melatonin has\nbeen found to improve organ transplantation and reduce graft failure when added to a\nrange of preservation solutions, including University of Wisconsin (UW) and histidine\u2013\ntryptophan\u2013ketoglutarate (HTK) [ 48,49]. These effects may add extra protection against\nischemic reperfusion injury.\nAt the moment, DuraGraft\u00aeis the only preservation solution that has been clinically\napproved as a vascular preservation solution [ 50]. However, the efficacy of DuraGraft\u00aeas\na preservation solution is limited to protect saphenous vein grafts during intra-operative\nintervals up to 24 h [ 51\u201353]. There is still an unmatched demand for preservation solutions\nfor prolonged ischemic storage. The results of this study may provide new insights into\nadding AL and lowering the Ca2+/Mg2+ratio of KH solution to potentially improve\nvascular graft patency and function following extended cold storage.\nMedicina 2024 ,60, 1284 11 of 13\nLimitation of the Study\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, we used aortic rings as the model for vas-\ncular graft preservation, whereas clinical settings typically utilize small arterial or venous\nsegments for bypass surgery. Therefore, the results of our study may have discrepancies if\ndifferent conduits are used. Secondly, the KH preservation solutions were freshly prepared\ndaily, which may not be feasible in clinical settings. Thirdly, for histological evaluation, we\nonly employed H&E staining to visualize the structural integrity of the endothelium and\nVSMCs. Incorporating immunohistochemistry staining could be beneficial for detecting\nendothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein.\n5. Conclusions\nVascular contraction and relaxation functions were severely affected after a 6-day\ncold storage period in normal KH. Modifying the KH solution by reducing the Ca2+and\nincreasing Mg2+levels greatly recovered the vessel functions. The addition of AL or ALMI\nto the modified KH did not further recover vascular contractility. However, only the\naddition of AL to the modified KH increased ACh-induced relaxation at 6 days when\ncompared to the conventional KH, suggesting that endothelium preservation is improved.\nFrom the histological analysis, it was found that the addition of AL but not ALMI further\nimproved the endothelial lining and the structure of the elastic membrane layers of the\npreserved vessels after 6 days of cold preservation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: A.A. and G.P .D.; methodology: A.A. and G.P .D.; software:\nG.P .D.; validation: Y.Y.D.; formal analysis: A.A. and Y.Y.D.; investigation: A.A., G.K.R.L. and S.L.L.;\nresources: A.A.; data curation: A.A., Y.Y.D., G.K.R.L. and S.L.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation:\nA.A. and Y.Y.D.; writing\u2014review and editing: G.P .D.; visualization: Y.Y.D.; supervision: G.P .D.;\nproject administration: A.A. and G.K.R.L.; funding acquisition: A.A.
