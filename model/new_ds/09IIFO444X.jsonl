Therefore, visual impairment caused by an increase \nin corneal deviations can lead to sudden and unstable loads in the lower extremities. We aimed to investigate \nthe possible relationship between low-energy meniscal injuries and corneal structural measures.\nMethods This prospective, observational study included individuals aged between 18\u201340 years with a normal body-\nmass index. The study group consisted of 54 patients with grade 2 or 3 meniscus injuries after low-energy activity. The \ncontrol group consisted of 54 healthy individuals without any complaints in the knee joint. The corneal parameters \nof all participants were evaluated with a Scheimpflug corneal topography and specular microscopy device. Simulated \nkeratometry (SimK), minimum central corneal thickness (MCCT), cylindrical diopter (ClyD), corneal volume (CVol) \nspheric aberrations (SphAbb), high-order aberration (HOA), coma values, and endothelial parameters were recorded.\nResults The research and control groups were similar in terms of age, body mass index, and gender distribution. \nThere was no significant difference between the groups in the corneal SimK and CylD, parameters. However, HOA, \nComa, SphAbb, and cell variability (Cv) values were significantly higher in the study group, and contrarily MCCT, CVol, \nand endothelial count (Cd) values were significantly lower.\nConclusions Our findings suggest that individuals with relatively lower MCCT values tend to develop meniscal dam-\nage after low-energy activity. Hence, the loss of corneal strength in these patients may be a sign of possible weakness \nin the meniscus. The HOA value above 0.26, the coma value above 0.16, and the SphAbb value above 0.1 may signifi-\ncantly increase the possible meniscus injury.\nKeywords  Meniscal tear, Corneal topography, Corneal aberrations, Collagen, Risk factor\nBackground\nThe cornea is a transparent, avascular tissue as the outer -\nmost part of the eye and creates the strongest refractive \nenvironment for the rays to fall on the fovea. The scat -\ntered hexagonal arrangement of Type 1 and 5 collagens, mainly found in the stroma of the cornea, provides cor -\nneal transparency. Collagen metabolism disorders form \nthe basis of several corneal diseases such as keratoconus, \npellucid marginal degeneration, and hereditary corneal \ndystrophies [1, 2]. Consequently, the corneal aberration, \nendothelial cell count and refractive properties of the \ncornea are altered in these diseases [3, 4].\nNinety-percent of the collagen in the meniscus struc -\nture is type 1 collagen, followed by type 2 and a lesser \namount of type 3, 5 and 6 collagens [5]. The meniscuses \ncarry, transmit and provide shock absorption at the knee \njoint [6\u20138]. The formation of meniscus tears are classified \nas traumatic and degenerative causes. The traumatic tears \nare mostly observed in young and active people, wheras *Correspondence:\nR\u0131fat \u015eahin\nrifat.sahin@erdogan.edu.tr\n1 Department of Orthopaedia and Traumatology, Faculty of Medicine, \nRecep Tayyip Erdogan University, \u0130slampa\u015fa Mah., \u015eehitler Cad., No:74, \nZipcode: 53020 Merkez, Rize, Turkey\n2 Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Recep Tayyip \nErdogan University, Rize, Turkey\nPage 2 of 6 \u015eahin\u00a0and Aslan  BMC Ophthalmology          (2024) 24:328 \nthe latter is a commonly a matter of elderly patients. \nAlthough traumatic tears occur usually after contact \nsports such as football and basketball, low-contact sports \nsuch as swimming, running and even walking and squat -\nting may cause these tears [9, 10].\nDue to the variability of the cornea, pupil and intraocu -\nlar lens structures, different light aberrations (deviation) \noccur while the light beam enters the eye. Since the cor -\nnea is not a completely perfect sphere, the rays coming \nfrom the periphery are not refracted as much as the rays \ncoming from the center. This may cause blurry images at \nthe edges. This is called spherical aberration. Coma is a \ntype of aberration produced by the lens because of the \nlarge number of parallel rays coming obliquely to the lens \nsurface and the high-order ocular aberrations (HOA) is \nused as an expression of higher order aberrations. Coma, \nspherical aberrations, and HOA are refractive aberrations \nthat reduce the vision of healthy eyes below retinal limits.\nPrevious studies revealed that distal femoral cartilage \nthickness was thinner in patients with keratoconus due to \nstructural similarities between the cornea and knee joint \ntissues, particularly via collagen [11]. This may indicate \nthe simultaneous structural changes of the cornea and \nthe articular cartilage. However, the relationship between \nmeniscal injuries and structural changes of the cornea \nhas not been evaluated so far.\nOur hypothesis is that individuals with visual impair -\nment due to corneal problems may have more menis -\ncus injuries without high-energy trauma. Due to visual \nimpairments, balance issues can arise during activities \nsuch as walking, running, and climbing stairs [12]. This \ncan cause sudden, uncontrolled stress on the knee joint. \nThese repeated low-energy traumas may lead to injuries \nin the menisci. In this study, we compared the corneal \nparameters of young patients with meniscal injury after \nlow-energy activity and healthy individuals. It was aimed \nto evaluate the possible relationship between the topo -\ngraphic and specular microscopic evaluation of the cor -\nnea and low-energy meniscal injury.\nMethods\nThis prospective, observational study included patients \ndiagnosed with stage 2\u20133 meniscus injury from 05/2022 \nto 11/2022 after low-energy activity in the Orthopedics \nand Traumatology clinic of a tertiary university hospital \nand healthy volunteers who were examined for other rea -\nsons in the same clinic as the control group.\nLocal ethics committee approval was obtained before \nthe study and all participants signed the written informed \nconsent. This study was conducted in accordance with \nthe principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in \npatients aged 18\u201340\u00a0years, with BMI 18.5\u201324.9, without previous knee and/or eye surgery, chronic autoim -\nmune and/or systemic disease, uveitis, glaucoma, and \ntopical/systemic drug use. Individuals with knee pain \nthat started after a history of trauma and patients with \nconcomitant ligament injury, advanced stage chondral \ninjury, or advanced bone or soft tissue edema sugges -\ntive of trauma on MRI were excluded from the study. In \naddition, those with malalignment in the lower extrem -\nities, muscle atrophy, discoid meniscus, ligament laxity, \npregnant and lactating individuals, and those with BMI \nvalues outside the normal range were also excluded. \nBesides, individuals over the age of 40 were excluded \nfrom the study to exclude degenerative meniscal tears. \nVolunteer-healthy individuals who did not have any \ncomplaints such as pain, snagging, locking, and/or \nswelling in the knee joint formed the control group.\nOphthalmologic examination\nAll participants underwent a routine ophthalmological \nexamination including best spectacle-corrected visual \nacuity with Snellen chart, tonometry, anterior segment \nbiomicroscopy, and fundoscopy. Afterward, the par -\nticipants were evaluated with the Sirius Scheimpflug \ncorneal topography (CSO, Italy) device. Simulated ker -\natometry (SimK), minimum central corneal thickness \n(MCCT), cylindrical diopter (ClyD), corneal volume \n(CVol), spheric aberration (SphAbb), high-order ocular \naberrations (HOA) and coma aberrations values were \nrecorded. The corneal endothelial count (Cd) and, cell \nvariance (Cv) values of the participants were evalu -\nated with a non-contact specular microscope (Tomey \nEM-4000, Japan). Topographic values were analyzed \naccording to the eye with the lowest MCCT, and specu -\nlar microscopy values were determined in the same eye.\nOrthopedic examination\nThe joint line tenderness, Mc Murray test, Apley test, \nand Ege test were examined in young patients with \ncomplaints such as pain, tripping or locking after low-\nenergy activities (walking, squatting, climbing stairs, \netc.) in the knee joint. If at least two of the tests were \npositive, the knee joint was imaged with MRI. Patients \nwere evaluated with a 1.5\u00a0 T clinical MR-sim scanner \n(Magnetom Aera, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, \nGermany) in the supine position and knee in full exten -\nsion. T1 and T2 sequences of axial, coronal, and sagittal \nsections were recorded. Stage 2 (linear signal increase \nin the meniscus that does not reach the surface) and \nstage 3 (signal increase extending to the free edge of \nthe meniscus) changes in the meniscus patients were \nrecruited for the study.\nPage 3 of 6\n \u015eahin\u00a0and Aslan  BMC Ophthalmology          (2024) 24:328 \n \nStatistical analysis\nThe categorical variables are given as numbers/percent -\nages. Continuous variables that provide normal distribu -\ntion are given as mean \u00b1 SD, while variables that do not \nprovide normal distribution are given as median (Min\u2013\nMax). The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was applied to test normal -\nity. The chi-square test was used to compare categorical \nvariables, and the Welch t-test was applied for continu -\nous variables with normal distribution. Statistical signifi -\ncance was set as 0.05.\nThe ROC curve and the cut-off point of each marker \nwere determined according to Youden\u2019s method and the \narea under the curve was calculated. The probability \nof being positive for the patient group compared to the \nhealthy group was calculated. The SPSS Statistics for \nWindows version 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) \nand R Studio 4.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Comput -\ning Vienna, Austria) versions were used for statistical \nanalysis.\nThe sample size was calculated as the type I error \n(alpha) is 0.05, the power of the test is 95%, and the effect \nsize is 0.6, the alternative hypothesis (H1) is two-sided. \nThe minimum sample size required to find a significant \ndifference using this test was 48 for each group.\nResults\nThere were 54 participants in both groups. The demo -\ngraphic characteristics of the patients are shown in \nTable\u00a0 1. There was no significant difference between the \ngroups in terms of age and gender distribution. The right-\nmeniscal injury was observed in 24 of the 54 patients and \n30 on the left side. Medial meniscus injuries occurred in \n34 patients (63%), the lateral meniscus was affected in 8 \npatients (15%), and the injury was bilateral in 12 patients \n(22%). Forty-four of the meniscus-injured patients (81%) \nhad grade 2 injuries and 10 patients (19%) had grade 3 \ninjuries. Higher-graded meniscal injuries were recorded \nfor statistical analysis in patients with bilateral-meniscal \ninjuries.\nThere was no significant difference between the groups \nsimK and CylD parameters (p > 0.05). Whereas HOA, \ncoma, SphAbb, and Cv values were significantly higher \nin the meniscal tear group compared to healthy controls. \nContrarily MCCT, CVol, and Cd values were significantly lower. The topographic and specular microscopy data of \nthe participants are shown in Table\u00a0 2. The ROC analysis \nresults of HOA, coma, and SphAbb values were calcu -\nlated to determine meniscal injury predictions and the \nresults are demonstrated in Table\u00a03.\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to investigate the effect of corneal disor -\nders on the development of meniscus damage after low-\nenergy activity in patients aged between 18\u201340\u00a0years. The \ntopographic and specular microscopic evaluation of the \ncornea was performed and compared with the healthy \ncontrol group. Patients with meniscus injury revealed \nsignificantly higher mean HOA, coma, and Sphabb val -\nues and significantly lower mean SimK, Thickmin, CVol, \nand Cd values.\nThere is a significant amount of collagen in both cornea \nand meniscus structures, in particular, type 1 collagen \n[2, 13]. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme plays an important \nrole in the synthesis of collagen [14, 15]. It was previ -\nously shown that there is a defect in the collagen struc -\nture and the LOX enzyme in keratoconus patients [16, \n17] and that these patients have high aberrations [18, \n19]. Moreover, keratocytes, which play a role in collagen \nsynthesis and repair, increase IL-1 receptor expression in \nkeratoconus patients, and a decrease in collagen synthe -\nsis occurs as a result of the increase in collagenase and \nmetalloproteinase production [20]. It is inevitable that \nthis decrease in collagen synthesis will adversely affect \nthe durability of menisci containing high amounts of col -\nlagen. Nevertheless, collagen deficiency and irregularities \nin the microstructure of collagen also cause deterioration \nin the meniscus structure [13, 21]. The endogenous and/\nor exogenous LOX enzyme application supports the mat -\nuration of the collagen network and the improvement of \nTable 1 Demographic distribution of participants\nMeniscus Control p value\nGender\n Male 26 (48.1%) 28 (51.9%) 0.70\n Female 28 (51.9%) 26 (48.1%)\nAge (years) 32.44 \u00b1 6.9 30.82 \u00b1 6.54 0.260Table 2 Corneal topography and specular microscopy \nparameters of participants\nSimK simulated keratometry, MCCT minimum central corneal thickness, CylD \ncylindric diopter, HOA high-order aberrations, SphAbb spheric aberrations, Cvol \ncorneal volume, Cd Endothelial count, Cv cell varianceMeniscus Control Test statistics P value\nSimK 42.99 \u00b1 1.32 43.42 \u00b1 1.57 -2.2987 0.122\nMCCT 528.07 \u00b1 35.79 543.50 \u00b1 33.38 -2.3170 0.022\nCylD -0.79 \u00b1 0.44 -0.98 \u00b1 0.61 1.9156 0.055\nHOA 0.28 \u00b1 0.08 0.24 \u00b1 0.08 2.3669 0.020\nComa 0.17 \u00b1 0.08 0.14 \u00b1 0.07 1.846 0.007\nSphAbb 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 1.43 0.022\nCVol 57.63 \u00b1 2.59 59.04 \u00b1 3.29 -2.4748 0.015\nCd 2536.69 \u00b1 179.42 2629.35 \u00b1 234.36 -2.3071 0.023\nCv 40.6 \u00b1 6.78 38.1 \u00b1 5.10 2.1312 0.035\nPage 4 of 6 \u015eahin\u00a0and Aslan  BMC Ophthalmology          (2024) 24:328 \nits functional properties in musculoskeletal tissues [15]. \nIn our study, the significant increase in corneal aberra -\ntions in individuals with low-grade meniscal injury may \nbe the result of deficiencies in collagen synthesis and \nstructure due to deficiency in LOX enzyme or IL-1 recep -\ntor expression.\nMeniscal tear is quite common, and their incidence is \n9.0 in men and 4.2 in women per 10,000 per year [22]. \nWhile meniscal tears occur because of various traumas, \noften sports injuries, in young patients, it is known that \ndegenerative tears are more common after the age of \n40 [23]. In order to exclude degenerative tears and the \nnegative effects of advanced age on vision, we did not \ninclude patients over the age of 40 in our study. Visual \nimpairment is closely related to balance problems [24]. \nTherefore, the visual impairment caused by the increase \nin corneal aberrations may cause sudden and unbal -\nanced loads on the lower extremities, which may cause \nan increase in the load on the meniscus and result in \nruptures. The data of this study revealed that the inci -\ndence of \u2265 grade 2 damage to the meniscus significantly \nincreases as the HOA value is above 0.26, as the coma \nvalue is above 0.16, and as the SphAbb value is above 0.1.\nCentral corneal thinning is observed in diseases such \nas myopia, keratoconus, and pellucid marginal degen -\neration, which are accompanied by increased corneal \nrefraction [25, 26]. Lower corneal thickness values in individuals with low-grade meniscal damage may sug -\ngest the loss of corneal strength in these patients and \nmight also be a marker of possible weakness in the \nmeniscus. Liu et\u00a0 al. evaluated patients with Marfan \nSyndrome and reported that corneal thickness was sig -\nnificantly lower in these patients compared to healthy \nindividuals [27]. Disruptions in systemic collagen syn -\nthesis can lead to thinning of the cornea, hence may \nalso provide a clue about the knee meniscus health of \nindividuals. Similarly, the endothelial number was sig -\nnificantly lower in individuals who developed menis -\ncal damage after low-grade trauma. That might also \nbe considered as a significant pre-marker to evaluate \nthe knee meniscus. However, since there is no study in \nthe current literature in this area, further studies are \nneeded to reveal the relationship between the thickness \nof the corneal layers and meniscus strength.\nThere were some limitations of this study. Firstly, the \nnumber of patients was limited and secondly the MRI \nwas performed for the diagnosis instead of arthroscopy, \nwhich is the gold standard for defining meniscal inju -\nries. Further studies in patients that underwent partial \nmeniscectomy may provide pathological meniscus sam -\nples to evaluate collagen sequences. Besides, evaluating \nthese patients not only with topographic parameters \nbut also with corneal confocal microscopy may help \nto better correlate ocular parameters with knee injury \nrisk.Table 3 ROC-analysis of significant corneal ocular aberration values\nAUC area under curve, HOA high-order ocular aberrations, SphAbb Spherical aberrations\nPage 5 of 6\n \u015eahin\u00a0and Aslan  BMC Ophthalmology          (2024) 24:328 \n \nConclusions\nAlthough several risk factors for meniscal injuries were \nsuggested in the current literature, corneal aberration dis -\norder was presented as a risk factor for the first time in our \nstudy [28]. Also, evaluation of individuals under the age of \n40 who developed meniscal damage after low-energy activ -\nity in Ophthalmology clinics might assist to define subtle \ncorneal disorders in these patients. Likewise, raising aware -\nness of patients with corneal collagen pathologies, such as \nkeratoconus, about traumas that may occur due to low-\nenergy activity may be protective against future meniscus \ninjuries. Studies investigating the need for collagen sup -\nplementation in these patients may also provide more con -\ncrete data on this topic.\nAbbreviations\nSimK  Simulated keratometry\nMCCT   Minimum central corneal thickness\nClyD  Cylindrical diopter\nCVol  Corneal volume\nSphAbb  Spheric aberrations\nHOA  High-order aberration\nCv  Cell variability\nCd  Endothelial count\nMRI  Magnetic resonance imaging\nLOX  Lysyl oxidase\nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nAll authors contributed to the study conception and design.
