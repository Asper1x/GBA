Globally ranked among the leading \ncauses of human disabilities, OA has gradually gained the \nattention of researchers since it highly impacts patient \nlives and its treatment usually requires colossal finance \n[3].\nArticular joints are comprised of different tissues, \nincluding cartilage and bone, with distinctive structural \nand mechanical properties. OA is characterized first by a \nloss of cartilage which then, due to abnormal joint load -\ning, leads to subchondral bone abnormalities driven by \nexcessive bone remodeling [ 4]. The pathogenesis of OA \nis complex. Although several studies have previously Introduction\nOsteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint dysfunction, \nis mainly characterized by joint pain and stiffness [ 1]. \nAccording to epidemiological statistics of OA, the inci -\ndence of OA in people over 65 years old can reach 50%, \nand the incidence of OA in people over 80 years old is BMC Musculoskeletal \nDisorders\n*Correspondence:\nWenxin Liu\nLiuwenxin_good@tom.com\n1Department of Sports Medicine, National Center for Orthopaedics , \nShanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People\u2019s Hospital, No. 600 \nYishan Road, Shanghai 200233, ChinaAbstract\nBackground  Although various anti-inflammatory medicines are widely recommended for osteoarthritis (OA) \ntreatment, no significantly clinical effect has been observed. This study aims to examine the effects of vitamin B6, a \ncomponent that has been reported to be capable of alleviating inflammation and cell death in various diseases, on \ncartilage degeneration in OA.\nMethods  Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model were established and the severity of OA in cartilage was \ndetermined using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system. The mRNA and protein \nlevels of indicators associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism, apoptosis and inflammation were detected. \nThe effect of vitamin B6 (VB6) on the mice were assessed using HE staining and masson staining. The apoptosis rate of \ncells was assessed using TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling.\nResults  Our results showed a trend of improved OARSI score in mice treated with VB6, which remarkably inhibited \nthe hyaline cartilage thickness, chondrocyte disordering, and knees hypertrophy. Moreover, the VB6 supplementation \nreduced the protein expression of pro-apoptosis indicators, including Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and raised the \nexpression level of anti-apoptosis marker Bcl-2. Importantly, VB6 improved ECM metabolism in both in vivo and in \nvitro experiments.\nConclusions  This study demonstrated that VB6 alleviates OA through regulating ECM metabolism, inflammation and \napoptosis in chondrocytes and CIA mice. The findings in this study provide a theoretical basis for targeted therapy of \nOA, and further lay the theoretical foundation for studies of mechanisms of VB6 in treating OA.\nKeywords  Osteoarthritis, Chondrocytes, Vitamin B6, Apoptosis, Cartilage, Interleukin-1\u03b2Vitamin B6 alleviates osteoarthritis \nby suppressing inflammation and apoptosis\nZhaoyi\u00a0Fang1, Qingxiang\u00a0Hu1 and Wenxin\u00a0Liu1*\nPage 2 of 11\nFang et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders           (2024) 25:447 \nidentified some specific contributing factors, including \npro-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor \n(TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 [ 5, 6], which can stim -\nulate the production of enzymes that break down carti -\nlage and inhibit the production of protective molecules, \nleading to the development of OA [ 7], the mechanisms \nof OA onset and progression is not fully understood. The \nwhole structure of cartilage components, including col -\nlagen, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, derives \nfrom a group of cells called chondrocytes. The self-repair \nprocess of chondrocytes is crucial in various pathologi -\ncal reactions; an extreme decrease of chondrocytes\u2019 cell \nviability is associated with elevated chondrocytes apop -\ntosis and perturbated homeostasis [ 8]. In addition, it was \nreported that suppressing chondrocytes apoptosis could \nhelp alleviating clinical symptoms and retarding OA pre -\ngression [ 9]. However, no significantly clinical effect on \nOA progression has been observed [ 10].\nPrevious studies have indicated that the concentra -\ntion of vitamin B6 (VB6) is highly associated with pro-\ninflammatory components in cells [ 11]. The plasma \npyridoxal 5-phosphate, an active biological form of vita -\nmin B6, can regulate the flux of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 \n(TNF-\u03b1) and other important inflammatory markers \nsuch as the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimen -\ntation rate [ 12, 13]. In addition, the inhibition of vitamin \nB6 has been reported to induce OA symptoms like car -\ntilage disorders [ 14]. A recent study suggested clinical \npractice concerning the beneficial utilization of vitamin \nB6 to block the inflammatory reactions in patients who \nhave rheumatoid arthritis. The authors demonstrated \nthat a 100\u00a0mg/day treatment of vitamin B6 decreased the \npro-inflammatory level of cytokine in arthritis patients \n[15]. It is important to note that VB6 can reverse reactive \noxygen species-induced adverse effects by inhibiting the \nxanthine oxidase activity [ 16], and the supplementation \nof vitamin B6 might protect the cartilage by modulating \nthe ROS level in OA [ 17].\nThis study aims to investigate the role of vitamin B6 in \nanti-apoptotic in OA. And this study provides an experi -\nmental baseline regarding the clinical applications and \nmedicinal effectiveness of vitamin B6 in the treatment of \nOA.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals and induction of collagen-induced arthritis\nThe following experiment was conducted in accordance \nwith ARRIVE guidelines and approved by the ethics com -\nmittee of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Collagen-\ninduced arthritis (CIA) model was established in mice. \nC57BL/6 mice (8 weeks) were obtained from Shanghai \nSLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd and randomly sepa -\nrated into three groups: sham group, CIA group, and \nCIA + VB6 group ( n = 12 per group). For CIA group, type II collagen (200\u00a0\u00b5g) dissolved in DMSO was added to an \nequal volume of Freund\u2019s Complete Adjuvant and emulsi -\nfied in the ice bath. Then, 100\u00b5L of the emulsified solu -\ntion was administrated through intradermal injection at \nthe base of the tail, and this immunization was boosted 3 \nweeks later. For the CIA + VB6 group, mice were treated \nwith VB6 (40\u00a0mg/kg/day) once per day for 4 weeks before \nthe CIA operation and the induction of the CIA was the \nsame as the CIA group.\nHistological assessment of CIA\nThe hind limbs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde \n(Cat# G1101, Servicebio, China) and then decalcified \nusing EDTA solution (Cat# G1105, Servicebio, China). \nThen, 5\u00a0\u03bcm thickness of tissues was cut from paraffin wax \nblocks, stained with Hematoxylin-eosin or masson stain -\ning [ 18], and the OARSI scoring system was monitored to \nmeasure the severity of OA [ 19].\nThe isolation of articular cartilage\nUnder sterile conditions, the articular cartilage was \nextracted from the knees and femoral heads of C57BL/6 \nmice at 8 weeks of age. The well-preserved cartilages of \nmice were rinsed with PBS and then segmented. Each \npiece of cartilage was digested for 30\u00a0min in 0.25% Tryp -\nsin-EDTA solution and then in 0.2% collagenase type II \nin Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) for 2\u00a0h \nat 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Therefore, the released chondrocytes were col -\nlected in DMEM/10% FBS solution. The chondrocytes \nwere seeded in plates and then treated with 10 ng/ml \nof IL-1\u03b2 based on the groups including control group, \nIL-1\u03b2 group, IL-1\u03b2 + 25\u00b5M vitamin B6 (VB6 25\u00b5M), and \nIL-1\u03b2 + 100\u00b5M vitamin B6 (VB6 100\u00b5M) group.\nCell viability\nTo evaluate the potential cytotoxicity of, the Cell count -\ning kit-8 (CCK-8) analysis was carried out. The CCK-8 \nanalysis was carried out according to the manufacturer \ninstruction (Dojindo, Japan). Cells were rinsed and the \nCCK-8 solution was added into the plates. Absorbance \ndensity (OD) values at 480\u00a0 nm measured through a \nmicroplate reader (Bio-Tek, USA) was used to evaluate \nthe cell viability.\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nThe cells were cultured in 96-well plates, and experi -\nments were performed when the cell confluence reached \n80-90%. The supernatants were obtained by centrifu -\ngation at 1000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min and sterilized by filtration at \n0.22\u00a0\u03bcm; then, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were measured following \nthe manufacturer\u2019s instruction of the ELISA kit.\nPage 3 of 11\nFang et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders           (2024) 25:447 \nTdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay\nThe slides were dewaxed and hydrolyzed in xylene three \ntimes for 5\u00a0min, two-times 10\u00a0min in 100% ethanol, two-\ntimes 10\u00a0min 95% ethanol, and two-times 5\u00a0min ddH2O, \nrespectively. Furthermore, the antigen retrieval was \ncarried out in 20\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C using Protein K solution \n(20\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL) and washed slides with PBS in 5 replicates. \nThen, we used a fresh-made TUNEL solution for the \nincubation step in a humidified chamber (37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h). \nFinally, the slides were transferred on the DAPI (Sigma), \nfive times cleaned with PBS, fixed with the Dako fluores -\ncence mounting medium, and observed on Nikon Eclipse \nTi2 microscope or Olympus BX51.\nWestern blotting\nTotal cellular proteins were extracted with RIPA lysis \nbuffer (Beyotime, China), which were then quantified \nby the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Beyotime, China). \nProteins were separated by SDS PAGE and moved on \na nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Then, \nthe membranes were blocked with TBS Containing 5% \nskim milk and 0.1%Tween20 for 2\u00a0 h before the incuba -\ntion with the diluted primary antibody at 4 \u2103 overnoght. \nThe primary antibodies used in this study were as fol -\nlows: Bcl-2 (Cat#ab182858, Abcam), Bax (Cat# ab32503, \nAbcam), Bax (Cat# ab32503, Abcam), cleaved caspase3 \n(Cat#19677-1-AP , Proteintech), and GAPDH (Cat# \nab8245, Abcam). Then the specific secondary antibodies \nwere incubated at room temperature for 2\u00a0 h. Each blot \nwas exposed to film using the super signal chemilumines -\ncence system (ECL, Pierce).Real-time quantitative PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted by the HiPure Total RNA Mini \nKit (Magen, China). Real-time PCR was carried out using \nChamQ TM Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix. The \nsequences of primers are provided in Table\u00a0 1.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data analysis in this study was carried out with \nGraphPad Prism version 10.0.3. ANOVA was utilized \nfor continuous variables involving three groups or more. \nEach experiment was performed in three replicates. Con -\ntinuous variables will be presented as mean \u00b1 SD. The \ndifferences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically \nsignificant.\nResults\nVitamin B6 blocks the progression of OA in CIA mice\nThe chemical structure of the VB6 is displayed in \nFig.\u00a0 1A. Mice were randomly divised in three groups: \ncontrol group, CIA group, and CIA + VB6 group. Mice \nin the CIA + VB6 group were treated with VB6 (40\u00a0 mg/\nkg/day) once per day for 4 weeks before the CIA opera -\ntion. The morphology of knees was filmed and the CIA \ngroup exhibited inflammatory morphogy, while the VB6 \ngroups displayed a minimized inflamaton, confirming the \nanti-inflammatory of VB6 (Fig.\u00a0 1B). Moreover, one week \nafter the collagen-induced arthritis, hyaline cartilage \nthickness was measured using H&E to assess the poten -\ntial impact of VB6 on chondrocytes alignment. H&E \nstaining revealed reduced hyaline cartilage thickness and \ndisordered chondrocytes alignment in the CIA group \nwhen compared with control group, indicating suc -\ncessful model construction (Fig.\u00a0 1C, D ). The CIA + VB6 \ngroup exhibited significantly increased hyaline cartilage \nthickness than the CIA group (Fig.\u00a0 1C, D ). In addition, \nthe CIA + VB6 group exhibited distinguished alignment \nof chondrocytes and attenuated hypertrophy than the \nCIA group (Fig.\u00a0 1C). What\u2019s more, the mRNA levels of \nextracellular matrix metabolism (ECM)-related indica -\ntors were measured. The results revealed that both type \nII collagen and aggrecan (ACAN) were significantly \nhigher in the CIA + VB6 group than those in the CIA \ngroup (Fig.\u00a0 1E, F ), and that ADAMTS4 and MMP3 in \nthe CIA + VB6 group were lower than those in the CIA \ngroup (Fig.\u00a01G, H ), indicating that VB6 enhances the syn -\nthesis and suppress the degradation of ECM in CIA mice. \nThe expression levels of MMP3 and type II collagen were \nassessed via immunohistochemical staining. The results \nshowed that CIA treatment significantly reduced the \npositive area of type II collagen, which was remarkably \nrestored by VB6 (Fig.\u00a0 1I-J). In contrast, the positive area \nof MMP3 in the CIA group was significantly higher than \nthat in the control group; compared to the CIA group, Table 1  The primer sequences in the present study\nGene Forward (5\u2019\u20133\u2019) Reverse (5\u2019\u20133\u2019)\nCOL2A1  G A A  G G A  T G G C  T G C A  C G A A A  C  C A A  C A A  T G G G A A \nG G C  G T G A G\nACAN  A C A T C C C A G A A A A  C T T C T T T  C G G C  T T C G T C A G \nC A A A  G C C A\nADAMTS4  G C T G T G C T A T T G T G G A  G G A  T G A \nT G G C C A G G G A A A  G T C \nA C A G G C A  G A T G\nMMP3  C C T A G C G C T C T G A T G T A C C C  G G A  C T G G A  T G C C \nA T T C A C A T\nIL6  A C C G G T  C T T G T G G A  G T T T C A  C A G G A  T C T T G G T \nA C T C A T G T G C\nTNF  G A G C A  C T G A A A  G C A  T G A T C C  G A G A A  G A G G C  T \nG A G G C A  G A A\nBCL2  C A T C C A C C A A  G A A  G C T G A G  C C A A  C G G G A  G A \nA G A T G A A A\nBAX  G A G A G G G A A A  T C G T G C G T G A C  C A T C T G C T G G A A \nG G T  G G A  C A\nCASP3  T G G C  C C T C T T G A A  C T G A A A  G  T C C A C T G T C T G C \nT T C A A  T A C C\nGAPDH  A G C C G C A  T C T T C T T G T G C A  G T G  T G G T A A C C A G G C \nG T C C G  A T A C G\nPage 4 of 11\nFang et al.

BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders           (2024) 25:447 \nthe CIA + VB6 group showed significantly lower positive \narea of MMP3 (Fig.\u00a01I, K).\nThe VB6 cytotoxicity on chondrocytes\nTo evaluate the potential cytotoxicity of VB6 on chon -\ndrocytes, cells were cultivated for 24 and 48\u00a0h with VB6 \nat concentration gradient (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 200 and \n300 \u00b5M). Then, through the CCK-8 assay we evaluated \nthe cell viability. The results showed that VB6 displayed \nno significant toxicity on cell viability at concentrations \nthat were not higher than 100 \u00b5M after 24\u201348\u00a0h of VB6 \nexpsure (Fig.\u00a0 2A, B). In addition, the cell survival rate of \nchondrocytes were significantly reduced in response to \nIL-1\u03b2 stimulation (10 ng/ml), while VB6 at concentra -\ntions of 10, 50, or 100 \u00b5M strongly reversed the negative \neffects of IL-1\u03b2 on chondrocytes (Fig.\u00a0 2C, D). Therefore, VB6 at the concentrations of 10, 50, or 100 \u00b5M were \nselected for further experiments.\nEffect of VB6 on IL-1\u03b2-induced inflammation and ECM \nmetabolism in chondrocytes\nTo asses the effect of VB6 on inflammatory response, the \nmRNA levels and protein levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were \ndetected. The results showed that the increased mRNA \nlevels of both IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 induced by the treatment \nof IL-1\u03b2 were significantly reduced by VB6 (Fig.\u00a03A, B ); in \naddition, the ELISA results revealed that the protein lev -\nels of both IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the IL-1\u03b2 + VB6 group were \nsignificantly lower than those in the IL-1\u03b2 group (Fig.\u00a03C, \nD). The results demonstrated that VB6 could attenuate \nthe inflammation induced by IL-1\u03b2 in chondrocytes.

BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders           (2024) 25:447 \nboth qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence were applied. \nThe results showed that the mRNA levels of MMP3 and \nADAMTS4 in the IL-1\u03b2 + VB6 group were significantly \nlower than those in the IL-1\u03b2 group (Fig.\u00a0 3E, F); and the \nmRNA levels of both type II collagen and ACAN were \nremarkably higher than those in the IL-1\u03b2 group (Fig.\u00a0 3G, \nH). In addition, the immunofluorescence results showed \nthat the immunofluorescence intensity of type II col -\nlagen which has been lowered by IL-1\u03b2 treatment was \nsignificantly raised by VB6 (Fig.\u00a0 3I, J), and the increased \nimmunofluorescence intensity of MMP3 was significantly \nlowered by VB6 (Fig.\u00a0 3I, K), indicating that VB6 prevents \nECM degradation and promots anabolism.\nVB6 prevents apoptosis in chondrocytes\nRT-qPCR results showed that the decreased mRNA level \nof anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, which is reduced by IL-1\u03b2, was \nreversed by VB6; in contrast, the increased mRNA lev -\nels of pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved caspase-3 induced \nby IL-1\u03b2 were reduced by VB6 treatment (Fig.\u00a0 4A-C). \nWestern blot analysis was applied to determine the \nexpressions of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2 in chon -\ndrocytes. The western blot results showed that the pro -\ntein level of Bcl-2 was lowered after the IL-1\u03b2 treatment, \nwhich was reversed by VB6 treatment (Fig.\u00a04D, E). What\u2019s \nmore, IL-1\u03b2 treatment dramatically increased the expres -\nsions of Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 compared to the \ncontrol group, and this trend was reversed by VB6, sug -\ngesting that IL-1\u03b2 might damage chondrocytes through \napoptosis and VB6 could alleviate IL-1\u03b2-induced apop -\ntosis (Fig.\u00a0 4D-G). To verify the role of VB6 in regulating \napoptosis in chondrocytes, TUNEL analysis was car -\nried out. The results recealed that a significant amount \nof TUNEL positive cells was generated in chondrocytes \ntreated by IL-1\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a0 4H, I). In contrast, chondrocytes \nthat received VB6 supplements displayed a considerably \nlow number of TUNEL positive cells when compared \nwith those only treated by IL-1\u03b2(Fig.\u00a0 4H, I), indicating \nthat VB6 has anti-apoptotic effect on chondrocytes.\nVitamin B6 exerts protective effects on knee joint tissue of \nmice\nFinally, using mouse CIA model, we carried out an in vivo \ntherapeutic assay to assess the benefits of VB6 in OA. \n8 weeks following the operation, the medial of the tibia \nplateau from the operated hind limb was sectioned and \nexamined. The HE staining showed that CIA mice treated \nwith VB6 exhibited increased hyaline cartilage thickness \ncompared to vehicle-treated CIA mice (Fig.\u00a0 5A, B). In \nparticular, the articular cartilage surface was rough and \nthe Masson staining was low in the CIA group (Fig.\u00a0 5C). \nThe cartilage\u2019s outermost layer in the CIA + VB6 group \nwas smoother than those in the CIA group (Fig.\u00a0 5C). In \naddition, the severity of OA in cartilage was determined using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International \nhistology score approach (OARSI) score. The OARSI \nscore displayed a lower level in the CIA + VB6 groups in \ncomparison to that of the CIA group (Fig.\u00a0 5C, D). The \nTUNEL tissue staining revealed a huge amount of cell \ndead in the articular cartilage surface of vehicle-treated \nCIA mice while CIA mice treated with VB6 displayed \nlower rate of cell dead (Fig.\u00a0 5E, F). These results dem -\nonstrated that VB6 exerts chondroprotective effects on \nknee joint tissue of CIA mice.\nDiscussion\nSeveral studies have shown that IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necro -\nsis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) are the main pro-inflammatory \ncytokines involved in the pathophysiology of OA. Hence, \nthe suppression mechasnism that generates IL-1\u03b2 and \nTNF-\u03b1 might constitute a potential protective path in \narticular cartilage [ 5]. In addition, the apoptotic rate of \nchondrocytes is highly enhanced in OA patients with \nsevere cell survival decrease [ 20]. In this study we first \nconfirmed VB6 exerts a protective role in regulating \nIL-1\u03b2-induced inflammation and apoptosis in OA.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that VB6 played \nessential roles in various stress-responsive metabolisms, \nincluding protecting cartilage from degradation [ 21]. \nThe levels of VB6 were found at the lowest concentra -\ntion in patients with RA diseases compared with healthy \ncontrols [ 22, 23]. What\u2019s more, it has been reported that \nECM metabolism balance is essential for maintaining \nhealthy articular cartilage tissues [ 24]. In our present \nstudy, the results showed that the ECM metabolism is \nimproved by VB6 when compared with the control group. \nExpression levels of ECM-degrading enzymes includ -\ning MMP3 and ADAMTS4 were remarkably decreased \nby VB6 in both the CIA mice and IL-1\u03b2-treated chon -\ndrocytes; whereas the levels of ECM markers including \nACAN and type II collagen were raised after the VB6 \ntreatment. Besides, inflammatory response also has been \nreported to be closely associated with the progression of \nECM disorder related OA [ 25]. The findings in this pres -\nent study revealed that VB6 could suppress the expres -\nsion levels of inflammarory cytokines such as IL-6 and \nTNF-\u03b1. Our results demonstrated that VB6 attenuates \nosteoarthritis by improving the ECM metabolism and \nalleviating inflammation.\nApoptosis is one of the most important process in \nOA pathogenesis [ 26]. Herein, we have evidenced the \nrole of VB6 in regulating apoptosis in CIA mice and \nIL-1\u03b2-treated chondrocytes by assesssing specific pro -\nteins including Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 that \nare critical indicators mediating the apoptosis progres -\nsion [ 27, 28]. In our present study, the results showed \nthat VB6 exerts protective effects on CIA mice and \nattenuates apoptosis in both mice and chondrocytes. In \nPage 8 of 11\nFang et al.

Our results is consistent with previous \nstudies which showed that VB6 alleviates apoptosis in \nvarious diseases or disorders such as LPS-induced myo -\ncardial injury, high glucose-induced islet \u03b2 cell death [ 29, \n30]. A previous study reported that VB6-deficient rats \ndeveloped advanced level of Hcy-induced atheroscle -\nrosis while supplementation in vitamin B6 significantly \nreversed the trend of Hcy-induced atherosclerosis [ 31]. \nOur findings indicated that oral administration of VB6 inhibits the progression of OA in CIA mice models. In \naddition, the decrease of thickness in the hyaline carti -\nlage, alleviation of chondrocyte degradation and OARSI \nscores observed in CIA mice treated with VB6 indicated \nthat VB6 could play a crucial role in OA therapy. In addi -\ntion, in this present study, TUNEL showed that the sup -\nplementation of VB6 reduces the apoptotic rate of cells.\nThis study has several limitations. Although this study \ninitially explored the role of VB6 in regulating osteo -\narthritis progression through alleviating apoptosis in \nmice, further mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

Additionally, the in \nvivo experiments demontstrated that CIA mice treated \nwith VB6 exhibited a reduced progression of OA than \nCIA mice without VB6 treatment. Thus, this study \nrevealed the protective role of VB6 in chondrocyte apop -\ntosis and cartilage degeneration, and provided a new \nunderlying mechanism and prospect for treating OA.\nAbbreviations\nOA  Osteoarthritis\nCIA  Collagen-Induced Arthritis\nOARSI  Osteoarthritis Research Society International\nECM  Extracellular Matrix\nVB6  Vitamin B6\nTNF  Tumor Necrosis Factor\nIL  Interleukin\nOD  Absorbance Density\nTUNEL  TdT-Mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling\nBCA  Bicinchoninic Acid\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s12891-024-07530-x .\nSupplementary Material 1\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Shanghai BiomedWorld, which helped to design this study.\nAuthor contributions\nZhaoyi Fang conceived and designed the experiments, prepared figures , \nwrote and approved the final draft.
