This was supported by \nconducting a set of hot compression tests at temperatures in the range of 250\u2013450 \u2022C under the \nstrain rate ranging from 0.001 to 0.1s\u00001. The flow curves at all thermomechanical conditions \nindicated high fractional softening representing the domination of dynamic recrystallization \nmechanism. Through a new quantitative approach, \u201cArrhenius type model \u201d, \u201cmodified Avrami \nequations \u201d and Poliak and Jonas method were simultaneously employed to investigate the kinetic \nof dynamic recrystallization. It was revealed that the strain required for the same amount of \nrecrystallization fraction increased with decreasing deformation temperature, and at a specified \ntemperature, the required strain increases with increasing strain rate. Interestingly, an anomaly \nwas found at 400 \u2022C under the strain rate of 0.001s\u00001, where the recrystallization kinetic was \nfaster than that of what was recorded at 450 \u2022C. This anomaly was discussed relying on the \nnanoprecipitation of \u03b3-phase at the prior boundaries and sub-boundaries which prohibited the \ngrain boundary migration and also the rotation and coalescence of adjacent sub-grains.\n1.Introduction\nThe empirical approach, which has long been used, is now recognized as being of limited value, because the cost of industrial scale \nparametric experimental investigations is prohibitively expensive in many cases. In contrast, the phenomenological and physical \nquantitative methods have drawn much attention due to their capability to predict the material \u2019s deformation behavior [1\u20133]. \nHowever, the accuracy of the proposed models is one of the most significant issues, which has been discussed in the majority of \ninvolved researches [4,5]. It has been widely demonstrated that the precision of quantitative models is microstructural dependent, in \nparticular for the case of high temperature industrial forming processes, where the dynamic recrystallization and dynamic recovery \noperates as the main restoration phenomenon [6,7]. Accordingly, in designing any processing scheme, the detailed knowledge of \nrecrystallization characteristics is of paramount importance, particularly those related to the kinetics. Thus, the modelling of dynamic \nrecrystallization behavior is considered valuable issue.\nThe Avrami relationship [8] has been originally developed to study the kinetic of static recrystallization. However, in view of \n*Corresponding author.\n**Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: zareih@ut.ac.ir (A. Zarei-Hanzaki), habedi@iust.ac.ir (H.R.

The application of this relation was \noriginally proposed as a so-called flow curve analysis method by Medina and Hernandez [12] and then modified by Najafizadeh and \nJonas [13] using a different functional form to evaluate the work hardening/softening characteristics. In the modified Avrami \nequation, the dynamic recrystallization volume fraction (XDRX) is considered as a function of applied strain, and can be quantified \nthrough metallographic investigations or flow curve analysis. The latter estimation requires the profound knowledge of flow \nstress-strain and work hardening behavior. In this regard, Stewart et al. [14] has employed the critical strain (\u03b5c), and the strain at \nwhich the rate of softening was at its maximum (\u03b5\u2217\u0086to plot the XDRX vs. \u03b5. The accuracy of their mechanical description was confirmed \nthrough their experiments to measure the volume fraction of dynamically recrystallized grains.\nIn the case of magnesium alloys, many efforts have been directed towards characterizing the recrystallization behavior from the \nqualitative point of view. It has been found that the AZ series, as the most common wrought and cast magnesium alloys, are prone to be \ndynamically recrystallized in wide range of temperature and strain rate through continuous [15], discontinuous [16], and/or \ngeometrical [17,18] mechanisms. In spite of the comprehensive researches conducted in this regard, there are limited ones which \ninvestigate the kinetic of recrystallization quantitatively. As a consequence, the object of the present work is the recrystallization \nbehavior modelling of as-extruded AZ61 Mg alloy through applying the Arrhenius type and modified Avrami equation. The effects of \nthermomechanical parameters including strain rate, strain and temperature are properly addressed through the manuscript. In \naddition, it is speculated that the presence of various microstructural features (the presence of \u03b3 nano-precipitates distributing either \nalong grain boundaries or sub-boundaries) may possibly introduce a significant effect on the recrystallization kinetics of AZ61 alloy.\n2.Experimental procedure\nThe experimental AZ61 Mg alloy was received in as-extruded rods holding the approximate composition of (Mg- 6.53 Al- 0.74 Zn % \nwt.). The cylindrical compression specimens, 12 mm in height and 8 mm in diameter (according to ASTM E209 [19]), were machined \nfrom the rods in a way that the deformation axis to be parallel to the extrusion direction. The hot compression tests were carried out \nusing a GOTECH AI-7000 L A 30-servo controlled electronic universal testing machine equipped with an electrical resistance furnace. \nThe tests were performed at predetermined temperatures in the range of 250\u2013450 \u2022C under the strain rates of 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 s\u00001. \nPrior to the tests, the specimens were preheated at deformation temperature for 7min and then the specimens were deformed up to the \ntrue strain of 0.6. Finally, at the end of straining the specimens were immediately quenched in water. To examine the microstructural \nevolution, the specimens were sectioned along the deformation axis and then mechanically grinded and polished. This was followed by \netching the specimens by Acetic Picral solution (10 ml Acetic acid, 4 g Picric acid, 5 ml water, 50 ml ethanol). The initial starting \nmicrostructure and deformed ones were revealed through optical and scanning electron microscopy analysis.\nFig. 1.The hot compression flow behavior of the experimental material at various temperatures under the strain rates of (a) 0.001, (b) 0.01 and \n(c) 0.1s\u00001.A.R.

The experimental curves indicate a typical recrystallization-accompanied plastic flow, \nwhere a single peak is followed by work softening down to the steady state regime at higher imposed strain. In the early deformation \nstage, the dislocation generation, multiplication and their intersects are significant, where the cross-slip is not enough to overcome the \neffect of work hardening, so the flow stress shows a rapid increase. Once the critical strain is exceeded, the dynamic recrystallization \nmay take place due to the adequate accumulation of the strain energy. Thus, the flow curve drops continuously to achieve the steady \nstate which is the dynamic balance between work hardening and dynamic softening. The sigmoidal S-shape of the flow curves at the \nearly stage of deformation at 250 \u2022C (specially at higher strain rates) is attributed to the possible activity of deformation twinning \nwhich substantially decreases at higher temperature. The contribution of prismatic and pyramidal slip systems at the temperatures \nhigher that 250 \u2022C [15] is substantially increased and not only decreases the twinning activity but also influence the softening behavior \nFig. 4.The microstructures of (a) as-received material and the specimens deformed under the strain rate of 0.1 s\u00001 at (b) 250 \u2022C, (c) 300 \u2022C, (d) \n350 \u2022C, and (e) 400 \u2022C up to the true strain of 0.6.A.R. Abbasi-Bani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                               \nHeliyon 10 (2024) e37625\n5of the experimented alloy and the involved recrystallization mechanisms.\nMany attempts have been conducted up to date to develop mathematical models to identify the critical strain for initiation of \ndynamic recrystallization. According to Jonal and Poliak model [20], it is postulated that the inflection point of the work hardening vs. \nstress curves (\u03b8\u2013\u03c3), which would be plotted up to the peak point reveals the critical stress. This is detected by fitting a proper third order \npolynomial Eq. (1): \n\u03b8\u0088\u03b11\u03c33\u0087\u03b12\u03c32\u0087\u03b13\u03c3\u0087\u03b14 (1) \nwhere \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b14 are constants for a given set of thermomechanical conditions. The best third order curves were fitted to the \nexperimental \u03b8-\u03c3 curves as are shown in Fig. 2(a\u2013c). At critical stress (\u03c3c) point, the second derivative of Eq. (2)would be equal to zero: \n3\u03b11\u03c3c\u0087\u03b12\u00880 (2) \nAccordingly, the critical stress and critical strain values are calculated, and the variation of which have been plotted vs. Zener- \nHolloman parameter (Z \u0088l\u03b5 exp(Q/RT) ) in Fig. 3(a and b). As is expected the critical stress (critical strain) has been decreased at \nhigher deformation temperature and lower strain rates i.e. by decreasing the Zenner-Holloman parameter.\nThe typical microstructures of the specimens which have been deformed at temperatures of 250, 300, 350, 400 \u2022C under the strain \nrate of 0.1s\u00001 are shown in Fig. 4. The microstructure of the as-extruded material is also included (Fig. 4(a)). The occurrence of partial \ndynamic recrystallization at all thermomechanical condition is clearly recognized, where the nucleation of the new grains mainly \noccurs at the prior grain boundaries. Since the dislocation tangles are much denser at the vicinity of grain boundaries, those are the \npreferred sites for the formation of recrystallized grains particularly at lower temperatures as is seen in Fig. 4b, c, d and e (follow the \nwhite arrows).\nThe higher the deformation temperature, the higher volume fraction of the recrystallized grains is achieved. This may be ratio-\nnalized considering the fact that the activation energy to trigger the restoration processes is lower at higher deformation temperatures.\nIn order to assess the recrystallization kinetics, the recrystallized volume fraction is expressed as a function of time as normal S- \ncurves [21], similar to those observed in classical recrystallization. Under the constant strain rates, time can be replaced by strain and \nthe recrystallized fraction can be described by the modified Avrami equation. So, the materials \u2019 capability to recrystallize at specified \ndeformation condition may be represented utilizing Eq. (3)[4],: \nXDRX\u00881\u0000exp\u221a\n\u0000(\u03b5\u0000\u03b5c\n\u03b5\u2217)m\u21d1\n(3) \nwhere XDRX is the volume fraction of dynamic recrystallized grain, \u03b5 is the experimental strain, \u03b5c is the critical strain for onset of \nFig. 5.The \u03b8 versus \u03c3 plots after the peak points under strain rates of (a) 0.001, (b) 0.01 and (c) 0.1s\u00001.A.R. Abbasi-Bani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                               \nHeliyon 10 (2024) e37625\n6recrystallization, \u03b5\u2217is the strain for maximum softening rate, and m is the Avrami \u2019s constant.\nThe strain for maximum softening rate, \u03b5\u2217, is attained where the value of work hardening (\u03b8\u0088d\u03c3Ed\u03b5) reaches the negative peak \ncorresponding to a minimum point of \u03b8 versus \u03c3 plotted after the peak point, Fig. 5(a\u2013c). The Avrami constant (m-value) is also ob-\ntained from the mean slopes of ln\u0085ln\u00851\u2215\u00851\u0000X\u0086\u0086\u00861\u2215\u00851\u0000X\u0086\u0086\u0086ln vs. ln\u0085\u0085\u03b5\u0000\u03b5c\u0086E\u03b5\u2217\u0086, which are plotted for all the deformation condi -\ntions. In this regard, Eq. (4)is used to calculate the amount of X: \nX\u0088\u03c3p\u0000\u03c3\n\u03c3p\u0000\u03c3ss(4) \nwhere \u03c3p is the peak stress, \u03c3 is the experimental stress after peak and \u03c3ss is the steady state stress (which corresponds to the XDRX \u226a1) \nand the mean grain size remains constant. In order to calculate X, as is shown in Eq. (4), two terms are used: the \u03c3p\u0000\u03c3 term indicates \nthe flow softening from peak to the stress of \u03c3 and the \u03c3p\u0000\u03c3ss term represents the maximum achievable softening. Therefore, Eq. (4)\ngives the magnitude of fractional softening at a given stress (\u03c3).\nThe predicted volume fractions of dynamic recrystallization obtained through Avrami \u2019s equation under the different deformation \ntemperatures and strain rates are given in Fig. 6(a\u2013c). The recrystallization kinetics is described as the variation of recrystallized \nvolume fraction vs. true strain. The corresponding sigmoidal behavior (S-curve) indicates that the recrystallization volume fraction \nincreases with the imposed true strain and nearly reaches the constant value of unity, which refers to the completion of the restoration \nprocess.\nAs is seen, under the specific strain rate, the strain required for the same amount of recrystallization volume fraction increases with \ndecreasing deformation temperature. In contrast, at a particular temperature, the required strain increases with increasing strain rate; \nthis means that the recrystallization is delayed to a longer time. This finding can be justified considering the fact that the thermally \nactivated processes have been decelerated by increasing the strain rate and decreasing temperature. Thus, under higher strain rates \nand at lower temperatures, the deformed materials tend to have an incomplete or partial recrystallization; that is to say, the recrys -\ntallization volume fraction tends to be less than 1.\nAccording to Fig. 6, the coupled effect of temperature and imposed strain on the recrystallization behavior of the experimented \nalloy is more pronounced under the lower strain rate. Under the higher strain rates, the \u201crecrystallized fraction vs. strain \u201d S-curves are \ncloser to each other and under lower strain rates, they are further apart. At the strain rate of 0.001 s\u00001, the recrystallization kinetic at \n400 \u2022C is higher than that of what has developed at 450 \u2022C. This anomaly would be rationalized considering the changes occurred in \nthe related microstructures by increasing the temperature up to 450 \u2022C. In this regard, the following procedure has been employed to \ncalculate the activation energy through the Arrhenius type equation (Eq. (5)) which correlates the flow stress to the strain, \nFig. 6.The predicted volume fractions of dynamic recrystallization obtained at different deformation temperatures under the strain rates of (a) \n0.001, (b) 0.01, and (c) 0.1s\u00001.A.R.

(6), and A, \u03b1, n, m are the material \nconstants which are experimentally determined. The true stress-true strain results obtained from the compression tests at various \nprocessing conditions were employed to calculate the materials constants of the aforementioned constitutive equations. The values of \nm and \u03b2 are obtained from the mean slope of ln\u0085\u03c3\u0086vs. ln\u0085l\u03b5\u0086plot and \u03c3 vs. ln\u0085l\u03b5\u0086plot, respectively (Fig. 7(a and b)) and \u03b1 \u0088\u03b2/m. \nMoreover, at a given strain (the true strain of 0.3), a set of parallel lines would be obtained by plotting ln\u0089sinh\u0085\u03b1\u03c3\u0086\u008avs. lnl\u03b5 at different \ntemperatures (Fig. 7(c)). Thus, the average slope of the lines would give the value of n.\nFinally, under a constants strain rate, the partial differentiation of Eq.

(7d) against the reciprocal of absolute temperature. \nThe Q-value of approximately 223 KJ mol\u00001 was obtained at the true strain of 0.3 through the whole temperature range of 250\u2013450 \u2022C. \nHowever, in order to explore the reason behind the observed anomaly in recrystallization kinetics (Fig. 6), the investigated temper -\nature range has been classified into the two specified regions and ln [sinh (\u03b1\u03c3)] has been replotted against the reciprocal temperature \n(Fig. 8(a)). The slope of the line is obviously changed at 400 \u2022C and the corresponding activation energy is considerably increased. The \nQ-value at the true strain of 0.3, in the region I (250 \u2013400 \u2022C), was calculated to be approximately 169 KJ mol\u00001 and in the region II \n(400 \u2013450 \u2022C) was about 260 KJ mol\u00001. In addition, through plotting the stress as a function of temperature (Fig. 8(b)) a radical change \nin the stress is also recognized at 400 \u2022C. In fact, a substantial decrease in stress level is expected to occur by increasing the deformation \ntemperature from 400 \u2022C to 450 \u2022C, however, owing to activation of a specified mechanism the flow stress experiences minimal \nchanges. These clearly indicate the variation in deformation mechanism by increasing the temperature from 400 \u2022C to 450 \u2022C.\nAll in all, the observed variations are in accord with the predicted anomaly in recrystallization kinetic at 400 \u2022C (Fig. 6), and can be \njustified considering the transition in deformation mechanisms controlling the softening behavior of the alloy. Increasing the acti-\nvation energy by increasing deformation temperature proposed occurrence of dynamic precipitation accelerating under the lower \nstrain rates. In this respect, the deformed microstructure at 450 \u2022C and strain rate of 0.001s\u00001 has been investigated in details and \ncompared with the starting microstructure (Fig. 9(a, b)). The deformed microstructures clearly verify the dynamic precipitation of \n\u03b3-M17Al12 phase at the prior grain boundaries (Fig. 9(c, d)). The precipitation of nano-sized \u03b3-phase, not only consumes the provided \nstored energy during thermomechanical processing but also decreased the grain boundary mobility and the capability for boundary \nmigration. The presence of nano-precipitates at the developed sub-boundaries could also prevent the subgrain rotation and coales -\ncence. Accordingly, owing to the effective Zener pinning effect of the \u03b3-nanoprecipitates, deceleration of the dynamic recrystallization \nand the observed anomaly in corresponding kinetic is logically expected.\n4.Conclusion\nHigh temperature flow curve analysis and microstructure characterization were employed to investigate the recrystallization ki-\nnetics of extruded AZ61 Mg alloy.

Calculating all materials constants, the modified Avrami \nequation was constructed and the recrystallization kinetics was described in terms of sigmoidal type behavior of the recrystallized \nvolume fraction vs. true strain. Under higher strain rates and lower temperatures, the deformed microstructure tended to have an \nincomplete or partial recrystallization. Under the strain rate of 0.001s\u00001, the recrystallization kinetic at 400 \u2022C was found to be faster \nthan that of obtained at 450 \u2022C one. The observed anomaly was attributed to the precipitation of nanosized \u03b3-precipitates at the prior \ngrain boundaries and sub-boundaries. This decelerated dynamic recrystallization through prohibition of grain boundary migration, \nand rotation/coalescence of the adjacent subgrains.\nData and code availability statement\nData will be made available on request.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nA.R.
