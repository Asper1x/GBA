Iron deficiency (ID), with \nor without anaemia, poses a diagnostic and therapeutic \nchallenge in patients with IBD due to the multifactorial \nnature of ID(A) and its frequent recurrence. Elevated \nhepcidin\u2014a systemic iron regulator that modulates \nsystemic iron availability and intestinal iron absorption\u2014\nhas been associated with oral iron malabsorption in \nIBD. Therefore, hepcidin could assist in therapeutic \ndecision- making. In this study, we investigate whether \nhepcidin can predict response to oral and intravenous iron \nsupplementation in patients with active IBD undergoing \nanti- inflammatory treatment.\nMethods and analysis PRIme is an exploratory, \nmulticentre, open- label and randomised trial. All adult \npatients with active IBD and ID(A) will be assessed for \neligibility. The participants (n=90) will be recruited at \nfive academic hospitals within the Netherlands and \nrandomised into three groups (1:1:1): oral ferrous \nfumarate, oral ferric maltol or intravenous iron. Clinical \nand biochemical data will be collected at the baseline and \nafter 6, 14 and 24 weeks. Blood samples will be collected \nto measure hepcidin and other biomarkers related to iron \nstatus. In addition, patient- reported outcomes regarding \nQoL and disease burden will be evaluated. The primary \noutcome is the utility of hepcidin as a predictive biomarker \nfor response to iron therapy, which will be assessed using \nreceiver operating curve analysis.\nEthics and dissemination The study has been approved \nby the Institutional Review Board at the Leiden University \nMedical Center (IRB No. P21.109) and other study sites. \nAll participants will provide written informed consent \nto enrol in the study. The findings will be published in \na peer- reviewed journal and disseminated at scientific \nconferences; the dataset will be available on reasonable \nrequest.\nTrial registration Prospectively registered in the \nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/ and the Eudra registries. First \nsubmitted on 10 May 2022 to the  ClinicalTrials. gov (ID: \nNCT05456932) and on 3 March 2022 to the European \nUnion Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database \n(ID: 2022- 000894- 16).INTRODUCTION\nAnaemia is the most common systemic mani-\nfestation of inflammatory bowel disease \n(IBD)\u2014ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s \ndisease (CD)\u2014which are immune- mediated \ninflammatory conditions marked by a \nrelapsing- remitting inflammation within the \ngastrointestinal tract.1 2 Anaemia affects \napproximately one- fifth of adult outpatients \nwith IBD and up to 74% of hospitalised \npatients or patients with a recent IBD diag-\nnosis.3\u20135 The burden of anaemia is substan-\ntial, as it has been associated with a reduced \nquality of life (QoL), cognitive performance \nand socioeconomic participation, increased \nhealthcare costs and risk of hospitalisation.6\u20139 \nAnaemia in IBD is often multifactorial, but \nthe most common cause is iron deficiency \n(ID).6 10STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY\n \u21d2The PRIme trial is the first prospective and ran-\ndomised study designed to assess whether hepcidin \ncan predict response to oral ferrous fumarate, oral \nferric maltol and intravenous iron therapy in patients \nwith inflammatory bowel disease.\n \u21d2The study intervention includes three most common \niron formulations: enteral ferrous salt, enteral iron \nbound to a carbohydrate and intravenous iron. This \ncomprehensive approach includes a traditional and \na newer type of enteral iron.\n \u21d2Iron deficiency (ID) and excess can affect the redox \nstatus and the intestinal microbiota, but the data \nare scarce. The PRIme trial addresses changes in \noxidative stress and the intestinal microbiota during \niron therapy.\n \u21d2ID will be identified based on routinely used bio-\nchemical parameters rather than the gold standard: \niron staining in bone marrow aspirate.\n \u21d2As an explorative study, the PRIme trial has a rel-\natively small sample size, with 90 patients ran-\ndomised to one of the three iron therapy groups.\n2\nLoveikyte\u00a0R, et\u00a0al. BMJ Open 2024;14:e077511. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-077511Open access \nIron is essential for most physiological processes, such \nas energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis and \nimmune system function. Unsurprisingly, patients with ID \nor iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) are likely to experience \nfatigue, depression or anxiety and can present with phys-\nical or cognitive impairment.7 8 11 In 2015, the European \nCrohn\u2019s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) published \nguidelines emphasising the need for frequent screening, \nprompt treatment of anaemia and normalisation of iron \nstores.12 According to the guidelines, intravenous iron \nshould be the first- line treatment in patients with active \ndisease or severe anaemia, defined as haemoglobin <6.2 \nmmol/L (<100 g/L). Given no previous intolerances, \noral iron should be prescribed as the first- line treatment \nfor patients with inactive or mildly active IBD.12\nThe safety and efficacy of oral and intravenous iron in \npatients with IBD have been proven.13\u201316 Intravenous iron \nsignificantly increases haemoglobin and ferritin over the \ncourse of several weeks; however serious adverse events \n(SAEs) occur in approximately 5% of cases.17 18 In contrast, \noral iron is associated with more frequent gastrointestinal \nside effects than intravenous iron (OR=3.14, 95% CI \n1.34\u20147.36, p=0.008, I2=0%) and can lead to poor treat-\nment adherence or discontinuation.18\u201320 Novel oral iron \nformulations have been developed to address the chal-\nlenges posed by the poor tolerability of standard oral iron \nformulations and high costs of intravenous iron, which \noften include (multiple) elective admissions for intrave-\nnous administration and result in loss of workdays.17 One \nof the new oral iron formulations\u2014ferric maltol\u2014has \ngained attention due to its effectiveness compared with \nintravenous iron.21 In addition, newer oral iron formu-\nlations, such as ferric maltol or sucrosomial iron, have \nbeen postulated to be absorbed differently than standard \niron salt compounds and have been associated with excel-\nlent therapeutic success likely due to improved enteral \nabsorption that is less affected by hepcidin\u2014a systemic \niron regulator that modulates enteral iron absorption \nand systemic iron availability.22\u201326 In contrast to standard \niron salt compounds, iron from these newer formulations \ndoes not readily dissociate, resulting in lower levels of free \nluminal iron and, consequently, fewer side effects.23 24 26 \nNevertheless, oral iron therapy in active disease states \nremains controversial. Murine studies showed that oral \niron might exacerbate underlying disease due to excess \nenteral iron, which alters the intestinal microbiota and \nincreases oxidative stress.27\u201329 However, the data are scarce \nand inconsistent, and these concerns are not limited to \noral iron.30\u201335 The optimal iron therapy for patients with \nIBD remains to be determined, as emphasised in a recent \nCochrane systematic review.15\nOral iron malabsorption in patients with IBD has been \nassociated with elevated hepcidin.36 37 Hepcidin regulates \nenteral iron absorption and systemic iron availability \nby modulating the expression of ferroportin\u2014the only \nknown iron exporter located in enterocytes, macro-\nphages and hepatocytes.38 39 Inflammation and iron over -\nload increase the expression of hepcidin, causing iron restriction within the iron- storing cells. In contrast, inef-\nfective erythropoiesis, ID and hypoxia reduce hepcidin \nexpression, promoting intestinal iron absorption and \neffective systemic iron utilisation. Although patients with \nIBD often suffer from inflammation and ID simultane-\nously, previous studies have shown that iron status is the \nprimary determinant of hepcidin levels, even in an inflam-\nmatory state.40\u201344 In addition, hepcidin has been shown to \npredict (non- )responsiveness to oral or intravenous iron \nin other patient populations; however, this remains to be \ndetermined in patients with IBD.45 46\nThis study aims to evaluate whether hepcidin can \npredict response to oral and intravenous iron therapy in \npatients with active IBD undergoing anti- inflammatory \ntreatment. This experimental approach addresses chal-\nlenges in ID(A) management in patients with active IBD, \nand it will provide the necessary data for personalised \ncare.\nMETHODS\nStudy design\nPRIme is an exploratory, randomised, open- label, \nparallel- group, multicentre trial (figure 1) in 90 patients \nwith active IBD and concurrent ID(A). Patients will be \nrandomised (1:1:1) to one of the three treatment groups: \noral ferrous fumarate, oral ferric maltol or intravenous \niron. The trial protocol is written in accordance with the \nStandard Protocol Items: Recommendation for Interven-\ntional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines, as noted in the online \nsupplementary table S1: SPIRIT checklist.\nStudy aim\nThe primary aim is to evaluate whether hepcidin levels \nat baseline can predict response to oral and intravenous \niron therapy in patients with active IBD and concurrent \nID(A). We hypothesise that patients with low hepcidin \nlevels at baseline will have an adequate response to oral \nand intravenous iron at week 14, whereas patients with \nhigh hepcidin levels at baseline might exhibit a subop-\ntimal response to oral or even intravenous iron.\nSample size calculation\nSample size calculation is based on the main analysis: \ncalculating three areas under the curve (AUCs), one per \ntreatment group and testing if they are significantly larger \nthan AUC 0.5. To establish that an AUC(hepcidin)=0.74 is \nsignificantly larger than 0.5 with 80% power at a 0.02 \nsignificance level, we will include 30 patients in each \ntreatment group. The sample size accounts for 10% attri-\ntion rate and includes Bonferroni correction for multiple \ntesting.\nRecruitment\nOn obtaining informed consent, the eligibility of the \npatients will be assessed and patients will be randomised \n3\nLoveikyte\u00a0R, et\u00a0al.

After the baseline measurements, patients \nwill receive iron therapy. Three follow- up visits are \nscheduled at weeks 6, 14 and 24 (figure 2). The visit at \nweek 14 marks the end of the treatment, and in cases \nof inadequate response, patients may receive further \niron therapy as part of regular care. The week 24 visit is a 3- month follow- up to evaluate ID(A) recurrence \nor ID(A) resolution in cases of insufficient response at \nweek 14.\nParticipants\nPatients with established and active IBD with ID or IDA, \nwho are under treatment at the Department of Gastroen-\nterology and Hepatology in one of the study sites, will be \nFigure 1 Graphical abstract.\nTable 1 The PRIme trial: enrolment, intervention and assessments\nTimepointStudy period\nEnrolment Allocation Postallocation Close- out\n-t10 t1t2t3Same as t3\nENROLMENT:\n  Eligibility screen X\n  Informed consent X\n  Allocation X\nINTERVENTIONS:\n  Ferrous fumarate \n  \n  Ferric maltol \n  \n  Intravenous iron X\nASSESSMENTS:\n  Demographic data X\n  Anthropometric data X X X\n  Medical history X X X X X\n  IBD classification X X X\n  Medication list X X X X X\n  Laboratory assessments X X X X X\n  Blood samples X X X X X\n  Faecal samples X X X X\n  Patient- reported outcomes X X X X\nIBD, Inflammatory bowel disease.\n4\nLoveikyte\u00a0R, et\u00a0al.

IDA (defined as ferritin <100 \u00b5g/L and haemoglobin \n<7.5 mmol/L (<120.9 g/L) for females or <8.5 mmol/L \n(<137 g/L) for males) or ID (defined as ferritin <100 \n\u00b5g/L and transferrin saturation <20% in females and \nmales).\nExclusion criteria\nA patient who meets any of the following criteria will be \nexcluded from participating in the study:\n1. Blood transfusion or iron therapy within the past 8 \nweeks\n2. Documented intolerance to oral or intravenous iron\n3. Severe anaemia (defined as haemoglobin <6.2 \nmmol/L (<100 g/L) for females and males)4. Documented history of liver cirrhosis, heart failure, \nhaemoglobinopathies, autoimmune haemolytic \nanaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic ob-\nstructive pulmonary disease\n5. Documented history of recent treatment for a malig-\nnancy (excluding cutaneous basal or squamous cell \ncarcinoma).

Major operation (eg, laparotomy) less than 6 weeks \nprior to enrolment\n11. Inability to provide informed consent either due to \nincapacitation (eg, resulting from cognitive or psy-\nchological conditions or hospitalisation in inten-\nsive care unit) or inability to understand the Dutch \nlanguage\nWithdrawal from the study and replacement\nParticipants have the right to withdraw from the study \nat any time or for any reason without any consequences. \nThe investigator may also withdraw a participant from \nthe study for medical reasons. In cases of withdrawal due \nto an adverse event (AE), the event will be registered as \nthe reason for withdrawal. In addition, participants will \nbe withdrawn from the study if they must undergo major \nsurgery or receive a blood transfusion.\nTreatment groups and randomisation\nParticipants will be randomised using Castor Electronic \nData Capture (CastorEDC) block randomisation services. \nThe coordinating investigator will initiate the automatic \nrandomisation sequence, and the results will automat-\nically be registered in the electronic case report form \nFigure 2 The PRIme trial. mHI, mobile Health Index questionnaire for assessing clinical inflammatory bowel disease activity \nand burden; SF- 36, Short Form 36 questionnaire for evaluating quality of life; WPAI, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment \nquestionnaire.

The investigators have \nno influence on the automatic randomisation sequence, \nand the used variable block sizes (ie, sizes 3 and 6) ensure \nthat the investigators cannot predict the outcome. In \naddition, randomisation will be stratified by disease \nactivity (moderate disease activity defined as either CRP \n<20 mg/L or FCP <300 mg/kg, and severe disease activity \ndefined as either CRP >20 mg/L or FCP >300 mg/kg).\nIron therapy with oral ferrous fumarate\nPatients randomised to this group will receive iron therapy \nas an iron salt: 100 mg two times per day ferrous fuma-\nrate for 12 weeks. The daily dose corresponds to 65 mg \nof elemental iron, which is in accordance with the recom-\nmended guidelines for patients with IBD.12 In cases of \nferrous fumarate- related AEs (ie, constipation), patients \nwill be advised to consume more fibre or receive stool \nsofteners, such as psyllium fibre. Ferrous fumarate can \nbe used during pregnancy; however, all women of child-\nbearing potential will be counselled to use contraceptive \nmeasures since becoming pregnant during periods of \nactive IBD is associated with worse maternal and foetal \noutcomes.47\nIron therapy with oral ferric maltol\nPatients randomised to this group will receive iron therapy \nin the form of iron bound to polymaltose: 30 mg two \ntimes per day ferric maltol for 12 weeks. The daily dose \ncorresponds to 60 mg of elemental iron, which is in accor -\ndance with the recommended guidelines for patients \nwith IBD.12 In cases of ferric maltol- related AEs (ie, \nconstipation), patients will be advised to consume more \nfibre or receive stool softeners, such as psyllium fibre. \nFerric maltol can be used during pregnancy; however, all \nwomen of childbearing potential will be counselled to use \ncontraceptive measures since becoming pregnant during \nperiods of active IBD is associated with worse maternal \nand fetal outcomes.47\nIron therapy with intravenous iron\nPatients randomised to this group will receive intravenous \niron therapy in one of the formulations used at the partic-\nipating study sites, that is, ferriderisomaltose or ferric \ncarboxymaltose. The iron dose will be calculated based \non the patient\u2019s weight and haemoglobin level: 1000 mg \nfor patients weighing up to 70 kg and haemoglobin >6.2 \nmmol/L; 1500 mg for patients weighing more than 70 kg \nand haemoglobin >6.2 mmol/L.12 In cases of intravenous \niron- related AEs (eg, urticaria, anaphylaxis), the infusion \nwill be stopped, and patients will be treated as medically \nindicated. In cases of AEs related to infusion reactions \nrather than allergic reactions, the intravenous iron infu-\nsion will be resumed at a slower infusion rate. Intravenous \niron can be used in second and third trimesters, but data \nfor first trimester are lacking. All women of childbearing \npotential will be counselled to use contraceptive measures since becoming pregnant during periods of active IBD is \nassociated with worse maternal and fetal outcomes.47\nConcomitant care\nDuring the study, all patients must continue with anti- \ninflammatory treatment for active IBD as part of routine \ncare; the type and dosage of the therapy are in the discre-\ntion of the treating physician. All changes in IBD therapy \nwill be registered. In addition, iron supplementation \noutside the study intervention is not allowed during the \nstudy period. Other concomitant medication, except for \nproton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients treated with \noral iron, may be given as medically indicated. Low pH \nis necessary for enteral iron to be efficiently absorbed; \nhence, patients randomised to oral iron groups will be \nadvised to stop taking PPIs or switch to other antacids \ntemporarily. Lastly, patients are not allowed to participate \nin other intervention trials during the PRIme trial.\nDrug accountability\nStudy medication will be labelled, stored and disposed of \naccording to the Good Clinical Practice regulation and \nnational laws. Drug accountability will be performed by \nthe investigators using a drug accountability log. Patients \nwill receive regular questionnaires to evaluate their \ncompliance, which will also act as a reminder to stay \ncompliant.\nPatient and public involvement\nThe PRIme study was initiated by the Leiden University \nMedical Center (LUMC) in collaboration with other \nacademic centres within the Initiative on Crohn and \nColitis (the ICC) network. The design of the study has \nnot been discussed with patient cohorts or communities; \nhowever, the ICC and the researchers work closely with \nthe Dutch IBD patient association Crohn & Colitis NL \nand the Maag Lever Darm Stichting, a non- profit organ-\nisation, who have previously indicated the relevance and \nimportance of scientific advancement and the under -\nstanding of ID and its treatment in patients with IBD.\nOUTCOMES\nPrimary outcome\nBaseline hepcidin levels and a binary response to \niron therapy will be used to evaluate whether baseline \nhepcidin levels can predict response to iron therapy \n(ie, (a) oral ferrous fumarate, (b) oral ferric maltol and \n(c) intravenous iron). The response to iron therapy is \ndefined as an increase >1.2 mmol/L in haemoglobin or \nhaemoglobin normalisation at week 14 for patients with \nIDA; or normalisation of iron stores (defined as ferritin \n>100 \u00b5g/L and transferrin saturation >20%) at week 14 \nfor patients with ID.\nSecondary outcomes\n1.

Each study participant will be assigned a unique \ntrial pseudonym, ensuring that only pseudonymised data \nare collected. Following national law, the coordinating \ncentre will only have access to pseudonymised data. \nSource data, such as medical data from medical records, \nwill be entered into the eCRF by site personnel or the \ncoordinating investigator. The investigator or appro-\npriate designee will sign and validate all data within the \neCRF. Collected biomaterials will be processed and stored \nin a \u221280\u00b0C freezer until analysis.\nAEs and safety\nAny undesirable experience occurring to a subject during \nthe study is considered an AE, despite its relation to the \nstudy intervention. All AEs reported spontaneously by the \nsubject or observed by the investigator will be recorded in the eCRF. Throughout the study, any event that results \nin death, is life- threatening (at the time of the event), \nrequires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospi-\ntalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or \nincapacity, results in a congenital abnormality, or requires \nmedical or surgical intervention to prevent any other \nsignificant medical events will be considered an SAE. \nParticipating sites must report all (S)AEs to the coordi-\nnating investigator or the PI. Life- threatening events or \ndeath will be reported to the Institutional Review Board \nwithin 7 days. All other SAEs will be reported within 15 \ndays using the national registration system (https://www. \ntoetsingonline.nl).\nANALYSIS\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive analysis will be performed for all baseline and \ndemographic data; continuous variables will be presented \nas means\u00b1SD or medians\u00b1IQRs based on the distribu-\ntion, whereas categorical variables will be presented as \nproportions of absolute numbers (n) with corresponding \npercentages (%).\nReceiver operating characteristics curve with associated \nAUC will be used to assess the discriminative ability of \nhepcidin levels at baseline to predict treatment response \nto iron therapy; these analyses will be performed sepa-\nrately in each of the three treatment groups by computing \nAUCs with their 95% CIs.\nWe will perform univariable analyses to study the rela-\ntionships between outcome variables and covariables. We \nwill base our analyses on the type and distribution of the \nvariables and use (un)paired t- test, Wilcoxon rank- sum \ntest, (paired) ANOVA, Kruskal- Wallis test, Mann- Whitney \nU test, McNemar\u2019s test, and Pearson or Spearman\u2019s \ncorrelations. In addition, we will perform univariable \nand multivariable linear (mixed- effects) regression anal-\nysis to investigate the association between the treatment \nchanges in hepcidin, hypoxia- associated or inflammation- \nassociated cytokines, as well as changes in QoL, WPAI and \nmHI. We will adjust our regression analyses for poten-\ntial confounders, which we will describe in the final \nmanuscript.\nIf necessary, missing data will be handled using impu-\ntation and described in the final manuscript. A two- sided \np<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

The study results will be commu-\nnicated to medical professionals through a peer- reviewed \npublication and conference presentations; local news-\nletters will be used to share the results with the patient \npopulation.\nDISCUSSION\nThe high prevalence of ID(A) and its frequent recur -\nrence, combined with a lack of evidence regarding the \nmost effective iron therapy in patients with IBD, highlights \nthe need to address this therapeutic issue.3 15 Despite the \nECCO guidelines emphasising the importance of prompt \niron repletion, studies have shown that ID(A) is often left \nuntreated.3 5 51 52 In addition, studies have observed a pref-\nerence for one or the other iron modality; we have shown \nthat intravenous iron is prescribed in over 50% of cases \nregardless of disease activity.3 5 53 In the Netherlands, the \nstandard practice to prescribe intravenous iron to patients \nirrespective of complaints, the severity of ID(A) or IBD \nactivity has created the notion that oral iron formulations \nare ineffective. Consequently, we encounter physicians \nand patients who strongly prefer intravenous iron based \non habit rather than well- established allergies or intol-\nerances to oral iron. We believe that personalised iron \ntherapy, guided by hepcidin levels, can provide valuable \ninformation for targeted and effective iron therapy, as \nwell as address the current biases formed by patients and \nphysicians alike.\nUntargeted or inappropriate iron supplementation \nin patients with IBD could lead to iron excess, oxidative \nstress and deleterious alterations in the intestinal micro-\nbiota.33\u201335 Anti- inflammatory therapy reduces hepcidin \nlevels in different patient populations, which might lead \nto better bioavailability of iron supplements.40 54 Given that patients with IBD often suffer from ID and inflamma-\ntion simultaneously, it is imperative to establish hepcidin \nlevels to prevent inappropriate iron supplementation. \nIn addition, tailoring iron therapy based on hepcidin \nlevels could mitigate potential side effects and reduce \nhealthcare- associated costs, for example, prescribing \noral rather than intravenous iron for patients with low \nhepcidin would prevent unnecessary admission and loss \nof workdays; in contrast, avoiding oral iron therapy in \npatients with elevated hepcidin would prevent clinical \ncomplaints associated with excess intestinal iron. In short, \nhepcidin- guided iron therapy could prevent adverse \neffects commonly associated with iron supplementation.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first trial investigating \nresponse prediction to different forms of iron therapy in \npatients with active IBD, especially in a prospective and \nrandomised setting. However, the study also has limita-\ntions. In the PRIme trial, we will include patients with \nactive IBD who are undergoing anti- inflammatory treat-\nment as part of routine care. Different anti- inflammatory \ntherapies may have varying effects on inflammatory cyto-\nkines and hepcidin levels, potentially influencing the \nresponse to iron therapy throughout the study. Further -\nmore, there is no universal cut- off point for ferritin to \ndiagnose ID in healthy volunteers or patients with IBD. \nIn the PRIme trial, ferritin <100 \u00b5g/L will be used to \nestablish ID during active IBD, based on the ECCO \nconsensus guidelines.12 To address these limitations to \nthe best of our ability, we will conduct analyses based \non disease activity and other iron parameters, such as \nsoluble transferrin receptor. Despite these limitations, \nthe PRIme trial will provide the necessary data for \npersonalised iron therapy aimed at preventing frequent \nID(A) recurrence, potential adverse effects and associ-\nated decline in QoL.\nTrial status\nThe trial was registered in the  ClinicalTrials. gov registry \n(NCT05456932). The first patient was randomised on 8 \nJune 2022. The trial is ongoing and actively recruiting. \nTo date, 26 patients have been randomised, but 6 have \nbeen excluded or lost to follow- up. The recruitment will \nbe continued until 2026; the period will be extended if \nnecessary.\nAuthor affiliations\n1Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Leiden University Medical Center, \nLeiden, The Netherlands\n2Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Medical Center \nGroningen, Groningen, The Netherlands\n3Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Radboud University Medical \nCenter, Nijmegen, The Netherlands\n4Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Maastricht University Medical \nCenter, Maastricht, The Netherlands\n5Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Amsterdam University Medical \nCenter, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank the other members of the \nclinical and trial team for fruitful collaboration.
