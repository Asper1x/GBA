This article is published with open access\nAbstract\nCorneal stromal wound healing is a well-balanced process promoted by overlapping phases including keratocyte\nproliferation, in \ufb02ammatory-related events, and tissue remodeling. L-carnitine as a natural antioxidant has shown potential to\nreduce stromal \ufb01brosis, yet the underlying pathway is still unknown. Since transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)\nis a potential drug target for improving the outcome of in \ufb02ammatory/ \ufb01brogenic wound healing, we investigated if L-\ncarnitine can mediate inhibition of the \ufb01brotic response through suppression of TRPV1 activation in human corneal\nkeratocytes (HCK). We determined TRPV1-induced intracellular calcium transients using \ufb02uorescence calcium imaging,\nchannel currents by planar patch-clamping, and cell migration by scratch assay for wound healing. The potential L-carnitine\neffect on TRPV1-induced myo \ufb01broblast transdifferentiation was evaluated by immunocytochemical detection of alpha\nsmooth muscle actin. RT-PCR analysis con \ufb01rmed TRPV1 mRNA expression in HCK. L-carnitine (1 mmol/l) inhibited\neither capsaicin (CAP) (10 \u00b5mol/l), hypertonic stress (450 mOsmol/l), or thermal increase (>43 \u00b0C) induced Ca2+transients\nand corresponding increases in TRPV1-induced inward and outward whole-cell currents. This was accompanied bysuppression of injury-induced increases in myo \ufb01broblast transdifferentiation and cell migration. In conclusion, L-carnitine\ncontributes to inhibit stromal scarring through suppressing an injury-induced intrinsic TRPV1 activity that is linked with\ninduction of myo \ufb01broblast transdifferentiation in HCK cells.\nIntroduction\nHuman corneal keratocytes (HCK) or \ufb01broblasts are inter-\nspersed between orthogonally arranged layers of collagenlamellae in the stroma. They are essential for maintaining\ncorneal structure and transparency as they express stromal\ncollagen \ufb01bers and different constituents of the extracellular\nmatrix [ 1]. Under a quiescent condition, HCK elaborate\nconstituents contributing to the formation of an organized\ncollagenous transparent framework stroma, but during expo-sure to various stresses or infection HCK can be induced to\nundergo transdifferentiation into \ufb01broblasts and myo \ufb01bro-\nblasts. This transition is essential for inducing the responsesunderlying wound repair and restoration of normal visual\nfunction. However, if this response is dysfunctional as a\nconsequence of excessive \ufb01broblast activation and transdif-\nferentiation into myo \ufb01broblasts, the cornea can undergo\nopaci \ufb01cation due to excessive irreversible scari \ufb01cation [ 2].\nInjury-induced corneal scarring \ufb01brosis and opaci \ufb01cation\nare mediated through TRPV1 activation upregulating\nTGF \u03b2-expression which in turn promotes keratocyte trans-\ndifferentiation into myo \ufb01broblasts and increases in smooth\nmuscle \u03b1-actin expression [ 3].

Such an outcome is\nexpected to improve restoration of tissue transparency as a\nconsequence of wound healing induced by severe injury or\ninfection [ 4,5]. On the other hand, there is a caveat to this\napproach since epithelial TRPV1 activation instead pro-\nmotes wound closure of this tissue. In order to circumvent\nthis complication, intrastromal injection of an antagonistmay be an option if it only blocks TRPV1 on stromal\nkeratocytes and \ufb01broblasts [ 6].\nOsmoprotective agents have also been identi \ufb01ed which\nlessen injury-induced stimulation of signaling pathways\npromoting tissue scarring during wound healing. Carnitine\nis one such agent ( \u03b2-hydroxy- \u03b3-N-trimethylaminobutyric\nacid) [ 7]. It is a nutritional supplement widely distributed in\nfoods of animal origin. A protective effect of L-carnitine\nwas described in retinal pigment epithelial cells [ 8] and\nhuman corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) [ 9,10]. In con-\njunctival epithelial cells (HCjEC), L-carnitine reduced\nhypertonic-induced cell shrinkage through interacting withTRPV1 channels [ 11]. L-carnitine also functions as an\nosmoprotectant to suppress in \ufb02ammatory responses via\ninhibiting TRPV1 linked signaling pathway in hyper-osmotically stressed HCEC [ 9]. Finally, L-carnitine reduced\noxidative stress-induced upregulation and stimulation of\nmatrix metalloproteinase (MPs) activity resulting fromexposure to hyperosmolarity in HCEC [ 10,12]. These\nresults prompted us to determine if L-carnitine application\nalso reduces corneal stromal responses underlying opaci \ufb01-\ncation through inhibiting TRPV1 activation on HCK.\nWe show here that L-carnitine suppresses TRPV1 activa-\ntion induced by exposure to either capsaicin (CAP), elevatedtemperature, or hypertonic stress in HCK. In addition, L-\ncarnitine suppressed injury-induced increases in HCK\nmigration. Its potential usefulness as a therapeutic agent wasdemonstrated by showing that it inhibited TRPV1-induced\nkeratocyte transdifferentiation into myo \ufb01broblasts. This result\nis relevant since it is known that this transition underliescorneal scarring and opaci \ufb01cation, which can be symptomatic\nin patients chronically af \ufb02icted with stromal infection.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture of HCK\nSV40-immortalized HCK cells derived from a human cor-\nnea were used as a representative cell model of corneal\nkeratocytes [ 13\u201315]. HCK identity was validated based on\ncon\ufb01rming speci \ufb01c keratocyte biomarker expression [ 4].\nCells were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal\ncalf serum as well as penicillin/streptomycin in a humidi \ufb01ed5% CO 2incubator at 37 \u00b0C. For the electrophysiological\nmeasurements, cell con \ufb02uence ranged between 60 and 80%.\nOver this range of con \ufb02uence, their electrophysiological\ncharacteristics were invariant [ 4].\nRNA isolation, RT-PCR, and sequencing\nHCK cells were seeded in T25 \ufb02asks and grown to con-\n\ufb02uence. Total RNA was extracted using TriFastTM(PeqLab,\nby VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manu-\nfacturer \u2019s instructions. RNA concentration and purity were\ndetermined with a NanoPhotometer \u2122(Implen GmbH,\nMunich, Germany) and it was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further\nuse. RNA (1.8 \u00b5g per sample) was reverse transcribed with\nRevertAid H minus \ufb01rst strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo\nFisher, Waltham, USA) according to the manufacturer\u00b4s\ninstructions in a total volume of 20 \u00b5l, and cDNA was stored\nat\u221280 \u00b0C until further use. PCR was performed with a 2 \u00b5l\ncDNA mixture in a total volume of 35 \u00b5l using Taq poly-\nmerase and 0.2 nmol/\u00b5l of each forward and reverse primer\n(intron spanning, 5 \u2032\u2011CCCCCGATAGCTCCTACAAC \u20113\u2032\nand 3 \u2032\u2011AAGGCCTTCCTCATGCACT \u20115\u2032, TRPV1 mRNA\naccession number NM_018727) after initial 95 \u00b0C for 3 min\nover 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 64 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for45 s, \ufb01nalized by 72 \u00b0C for 7 min and a temperature hold at\n4 \u00b0C in a Techne TC-512 gradient thermal cycler (Staf-\nfordshire, UK), yielding a 295 bp product. Samples withRNAse- and DNAse-free H\n2O instead of cDNA template\nand samples that were proceeded without reverse tran-\nscriptase in the reverse transcription reaction served as non-template controls. Total RNA from a con \ufb02uent human cor-\nneal endothelial cell line (HCEC-12) served as positive\ncontrol [ 16]. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5%\nagarose gel at 120 V for 1.75 h and visualized with ethidium\nbromide. Bands were cut out and DNA was eluted from the\nagarose using MP Biomedicals \u2122Geneclean \u2122Turbo Kit\n(Thermo Fisher) in a total elute volume of 30 \u00b5l. Eluted PCR\nproducts were sequenced (Euro \ufb01ns Genomics GmbH,\nEbersberg, Germany) and sequencing results were checkedwith NCBI Blast \u00aesoftware ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ).\nFluorescence calcium imaging\nHCK cells were pre-incubated with culture medium con-\ntaining 1 \u00b5mol/l fura-2/AM for \u224840 min. The loading was\nstopped with a Ringer-like (control) solution containing\n(mmol/l): 150 NaCl, 6 CsCl, 1 MgCl 2, 10 glucose, 10\nHEPES, and 1.5 CaCl 2at pH 7.4 and 317 mOsmol/l [ 17]. At\nroom temperature ( \u224823 \u00b0C), intracellular free Ca2+([Ca2+]i)\nlevels were measured based on fura-2 emission at 510 nm\nresulting from alternating excitation in a 5 s loop at 340 and380 nm with a digital imaging system (Olympus Europa\nHolding GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were culturedL-carnitine suppresses transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 activity and myo \ufb01broblast. . . 681\non coverslips (diameter 15 mm) and put in a chamber con-\ntaining the aforementioned Ringer-like solution. Single cells\nwere selected and designated as regions of interest. Cells were\nexposed to UV-light within a 5-s interval using a LED light\nsource (LED-Hub by Omikron, Rodgau-Dudenhofen, Ger-\nmany). The images were simultaneously recorded with adigital camera (Olympus XM-10) and f\n340nm/f380nm \ufb02uores-\ncence ratios, which are proportional to [Ca2+]i, were calcu-\nlated by cellSens software (Olympus Europa Holding GmbH,Hamburg, Germany). Fluorescence ratios were normalized\n(control set to 0.1) and averaged (with error bars) and results\nshown as mean traces of the f\n340nm/f380nm ratio \u00b1 SEM (error\nbars in both directions) with n -values indicating the number of\nexperiments per data point. Ca2+increases were time delayed\nbecause drugs were pipetted into a stationary bath rather thana\ufb02ow through system. L-carnitine effects were evaluated\nfollowing a 30 min preincubation period. Drug stock solutions\nwere prepared with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dilutedto obtain a nontoxic working concentration wherein DMSO\ndid not exceed 0.1%. Hypertonic stress (i.e., 450 mOsmol/l)\nwas imposed by supplementing isotonic Ringer-like solutionwith 130 mmol/l D-mannitol to obtain a hypertonic Ringer-\nlike solution.\nScratch wound cell migration assay\nHCKs were incubated in 12-well plates for 48 h until the cells\nreached con \ufb02uence, which was then scratched using a pipette\ntip. The cell layer was subsequently washed twice with PBS,\nand then fresh medium was added. The non-treated cellsserved as controls whereas those treated with 1 mmol/l\nL-carnitine were incubated for either another 8 or 24 h.\nImages were acquired at 0, 8, and 24 h post treatment usingphase-contrast microscopy with a \u00d710 objective lens. The\nopen wound areas were calculated using Image software\n(3 replicates).\nImmunocytochemistry\nHCK cells were cultured for 3 days in 12-well cell culture\nplates. Before \ufb01xation, HCK cells were stimulated for 24 h\nwith 5 ng/ml human recombinant transforming growthfactor beta 1 (TGF \u03b21, ab50036, Abcam, Cambrigde, United\nKingdom), 10 \u00b5mol/l capsazepine (CPZ), 1 mmol/l L-car-\nnitine, 5 ng/ml TGF \u03b21 plus 10 \u00b5mol/l CPZ, whereas 5 ng/ml\nTGF \u03b21 plus 1 mmol/l L-carnitine with Dulbecco \u2019s Modi \ufb01ed\nEagle Medium (DMEM) served as a control. Vital cells\nwere \ufb01xed for 30 min using 4% formaldehyde, followed by\nwashing three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.6,\n10 min each). Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-\nX100 (15 min) and blocked with 5% BSA in TBS for60 min. HCK cells were incubated overnight in a humidi \ufb01ed\nchamber at 4 \u00b0C with primary alpha-smooth muscle actin(\u03b1SMA) antibodies (1:200, 701457, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nCalifornia, USA) diluted in 0.8% BSA in TBS. Fluores-\ncence detection employed Cy3 conjugated secondary anti-\nbodies (1:200, C2306; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri,\nUSA) and DAPI nuclear counterstaining. Mounted slides\nwere examined using light microscopy (Axio Imager.M2;Zeiss, Jena, Germany).\nPlanar patch-clamp recordings\nHCK whole cell currents were evaluated as previouslydescribed [ 4]. In brief, a standard intracellular solution con-\ntaining (mmol/l): 50 CsCl, 10 NaCl, 60 CsF, 20 EGTA, and\n10 HEPES at pH \u22487.2 and \u2248288 mOsmol/l was applied to the\nmicrochip (both provided by Nanion, Munich, Germany).The external solution contained (mmol/l): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1\nMgCl\n2,2C a C l 2, 5 D-glucose monohydrate, and 10 HEPES,\npH\u22487.4 and osmolarity \u2248298 mOsmol/l. Mean membrane\ncapacitance (17 \u00b1 6 pF; n=7) and mean access resistance (7\n\u00b12M\u03a9;n=7) were calculated by the software. Series\nresistances, fast and slow capacitance transients were com-pensated by the ampli \ufb01er in conjunction with the PatchMaster\nsoftware. Current recordings were all leak-subtracted and cells\nwith leak currents above 100 pA were discarded. Cells weredepolarized every 5 s from \u221260 to+130 mV in 500 ms steps\n(voltage ramp). The holding potential (HP) was set to 0 mV in\norder to eliminate any possible contribution by voltage-dependent Ca\n2+channel activity. Experiments were started\n~10 min after breaking into a whole-cell con \ufb01guration [ 18].\nResulting currents were normalized using cell membranecapacitance to obtain current density (pA/pF).\nStatistical analysis\nParametric Student \u2019st-test for paired and unpaired data was\nused to determine if the data passed the normality test.Otherwise, the nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used.\nPvalues < 0.05 were considered as signi \ufb01cant. All values in\nthe bar charts are shown as means \u00b1 SEM (error bars in bothdirections). Signi \ufb01cance was determined using the Graph-\nPad Prism software (version 5.00 for Windows) (La Jolla,\nCalifornia, USA). The bar charts were generated with thesame software. All other plots were generated with the\nSigmaPlot software version 12.5 for Windows (Systat\nSoftware, San Jose, California, USA).\nResults\nTRPV1 expression and function in HCK\nFigure 1A provides a result consistent with TRPV1 gene\nexpression based on obtaining the predicted 295 bp682 E.

In\naddition, Fig. 1B\u2013D con \ufb01rm functional TRPV1 expression\nbased on using CAP and the speci \ufb01c TRPV1 blocker AMG\n9810 [ 19]. Speci \ufb01cally, extracellular application of 20 \u00b5mol/\nl CAP increased the \ufb02uorescence ratio ( f340/f380) from 0.1011\n(100 s) \u00b1 0.0002 to 0.1068 \u00b1 0.0021 after 300 s ( n=21;p<\n0.005; Fig. 1B, D). In the presence of 10 \u00b5mol/l AMG\n9810, this CAP-induced Ca2+increase could be clearly\nsuppressed to 0.1001 \u00b1 0.0010 at 300 s ( n=23;p< 0.005;\nFig.1C, D).\nWhole cell patch-clamp recordings are also supportive of\nfunctional TRPV1 expression in HCK since 10 \u00b5mol/l CAPinduced increases in whole cell currents (Fig. 2). These\nincreases were evaluated based on the plots of the corre-\nsponding current voltage relationships at the time pointsdesignated as: A, B and C (Fig. 2A, B). At positive\npotentials, this TRPV1 agonist increased the typical out-\nward TRPV1-like rectifying currents from 172 \u00b1 71 pA/pFto 281 \u00b1 117 pA/pF ( n=7;p< 0.05) ( n=7;p< 0.05)\n(Fig. 2B, C). Similarly, maximal inward current amplitudes\ninduced by a voltage step from 0 to \u221260 mV increased to\n\u221266 \u00b1 32% of control ( n=7;p< 0.005) (Fig. 2D). Max-\nimal outward current amplitudes induced by a voltage step\nfrom 0 to +130 mV increased to 173 \u00b1 13% of control\n(control set to 100%) ( n=7;p< 0.01) (Fig. 2E).\nL-carnitine inhibits TRPV1 activation\nFigure 2shows that L-carnitine (1 mmol/l) suppressed CAP-\ninduced increases of whole-cell currents induced by a vol-tage step from \u221260 to+130 mV. CAP (10 \u00b5mol/l) increased\nboth in- and outward currents, whereas 1 mmol/l L-carnitine\nsuppressed them from \u221232 \u00b1 13 pA/pF to \u221211 \u00b1 6 pA/pF\n(n=7;p< 0.05) (Fig. 2A\u2013C) and outward current density\nwas suppressed from 281 \u00b1 117 pA/pF to 225 \u00b1 109 pA/pF\n(both n=7;p< 0.05) (Fig. 2C). Similarly, maximal inward\ncurrent amplitudes induced by a voltage step from 0 to\n\u221260 mV decreased them to 112 \u00b1 16% of control ( n=7;\np< 0.005) (Fig. 2D) and maximal outward current ampli-\ntudes induced by a voltage step from 0 to +130 mV\ndecreased to 108 \u00b1 12% of control ( n=7;p< 0.01) (control\nset to 100%) (Fig. 2E). Similarly, extracellular application of\n10 \u00b5mol/l CAP increased the \ufb02uorescence ratio ( f\n340/f380)\nrose from 0.1001 (100 s) \u00b1 0.0003 to 0.1218 \u00b1 0.0055 after\n300 s ( n=21;p< 0.005; Fig. 3A, C). With HCK cell pas-\nsage 79, this increase was suppressed in the presence of\n1 mmol/l L-carnitine ( f340/f380=0.1011 \u00b1 0.0004; t=300 s;\nn=29; p< 0.005) (Fig. 3B, C). Similar results were\nobtained using HCK at earlier cell passages (P69, Fig. 3C).\nRaising the bath temperature to >43 \u00b0C, which typically\nactivates TRPV1 [ 20], increased the f 340/f380 ratio\nfrom 0.1002 \u00b1 0.0003 (100 s) to 0.1971 \u00b1 0.0068 after 300 s\n(n=205; p< 0.005; Fig. 4A, C).

Turan et al.\nHCK migration to proceed for 24 h, the area of the open\nwound was 30% larger than in the control (control =26 \u00b1\n7%; 1 mmol/l L-carnitine =56 \u00b1 3%; n=4;p<0 . 0 5 ) ,\nindicating that L-carnitine inhibited wound closure(Fig. 6F\u2013L). Moreover, the TRPV1 channel blocker cap-\nsazepine (CPZ) (10 \u00b5mol/l) as a positive control almost\ncompletely inhibited wound closure since the area of theopen wound area was 66% larger than in the control\n(control =26 \u00b1 7%; 10 \u00b5mol/l CPZ =92 \u00b1 4%; n=3\u20134;\np< 0.005) (Fig. 6H, K, L). On the other hand, the open\nwound area in samples with 1 mmol/l L-carnitine was\n15% smaller than that in samples with 10 \u00b5mol/l CPZ\n(Fig. 6L). This difference suggests that CPZ ef \ufb01cacy in\ninhibiting HCK migration is greater than that of\nL-carnitine.L-carnitine suppresses myo \ufb01broblast\ntransdifferentiation\nThe functional contribution of TRPV1 in controlling the\nHCK transdifferentiation into myo \ufb01broblasts was evaluated\nby determining if L-carnitine inhibited TGF \u03b2-induced\nkeratocyte transdifferentiation into myo \ufb01broblasts [ 21].\nThis is a relevant approach since corneal injury leads to\nopaci \ufb01cation as a consequence of TGF \u03b2-induced TRPV1\nupregulation followed by increases in keratocyte transdif-ferentiation into myo \ufb01broblasts. Accordingly, the ability of\nL-carnitine to suppress HCK transdifferentiation was\ninvestigated by immunostaining against the myo \ufb01broblast\nbiomarker \u03b1SMA in the cytoplasm. Preincubation with\n5 ng/ml TGF \u03b2for 24 h increased \u03b1SMA-positive cyto-\nplasmic staining, which is indicative of myo \ufb01broblast\ntransdifferentiation (Fig. 7)[21]. In the untreated control\ncultures, cytoplasmic \u03b1SMA staining was absent. During\nFig. 3 L-carnitine suppressed CAP-induced increases of intracel-\nlular Ca2+concentration. A 10 \u00b5mol/l CAP induced an increase in\nCa2+in\ufb02ux (n=21) in HCK (P79) whereas non-treated control cells\nmaintained a constant Ca2+baseline ( n=9).BSame experiment as\nshown in A, but in the presence of L-carnitine (HCK P79).

Speci \ufb01cally, in the presence of\nTGF \u03b21 plus L-carnitine, there was a slight reduction in\n\u03b1SMA-positive cytoplasmic staining, whereas TGF \u03b21 plus\nCPZ resulted in a more prominent reduction in cytoplasmic\u03b1SMA immunostaining. Nevertheless, the similarity\nbetween these two trends suggests that L-carnitine reduced\nTRPV1 activation by TGF \u03b2.\nDiscussion\nFunctional TRPV1 expression\nWe document here gene and functional TRPV1 expression\nin an immortalized HCK cell line (Figs. 1,2A,3A) based inpart on the effects of CAP and AMG 9810, which are\nvalidated TRPV1 channel modulators [ 19,22]. Its presence\nagrees with similar previous studies in primary HCK cells\nand corneal \ufb01broblasts [ 4,5]. The electrophysiological\nresponses that are signatures of TRPV1 activity such as\noutwardly rectifying currents, a reverse potential near 0 mV(Fig. 2B) and CAP-induced current rises as well as\nincreased Ca\n2+in\ufb02uxes (Figs. 1\u20133) are very similar to those\ndescribed in other corneal cell types [ 4,16,23]. In addition,\nits invariant expression irrespective of cell passage number\nalso supports the relevance of this cell model. Increased\nCa2+in\ufb02ux upon raising the temperature above 43 \u00b0C\n(Fig. 4A) or exposure to 450 mOsmol/l hypertonic stress\n(Fig. 5A) further indicated functional TRPV1 expression\n[24,25]. These responses are pertinent to the in vivo con-\ndition since TRPV1 activation is documented to be induced\nby such stresses and it is alleged to contribute to dry\neye symptomology. Speci \ufb01cally, the imposed hypertonic\nstress is also relevant because it is an established marker\nused to diagnose dry eye disease [ 26\u201328]. It is likely that\nthis imposed stress is pertinent to dry eye induced ocularpain even though in these patients the hyperosmotic\nthreshold for inducing pain through TRPV1 activation is\nunclear [ 29].\nL-carnitine suppresses responses linked to TRPV1\nactivation\nEven though L-carnitine is a TRPV1 antagonist in some\nother ocular cell types [ 11], such an effect had not been\npreviously described in immortalized HCK cells. Never-\ntheless, L-carnitine eye drop supplementation in arti \ufb01cial\ntears helps relieve some dry eye symptomology [ 30]. Pre-\nvious to the current study it was only known that L-carnitine\nacts as an osmoprotectant and inhibitor of MAPK signaling\npathway-induced stimulation of proin \ufb02ammatory cytokine\nrelease [ 7,10]. Here we show that part of therapeutic effect\nof arti \ufb01cial tears supplemented with L-carnitine likely stems\nfrom its inhibition of TRPV1-induced keratocyte transdif-ferentiation into myo \ufb01broblasts. This conclusion is based on\nshowing that L-carnitine suppressed the following TRPV1-\ninduced responses: (1) 1 mmol/l L-carnitine reduced CAP-induced increases of the whole-cell currents (Fig. 2) and\ncorresponding rises in intracellular Ca\n2+levels (Fig. 3). (2)\nL-carnitine reduced both rises in TRPV1 activity inducedby hyperosmolarity and a rise in temperature (Figs. 4,5).\nSpeci \ufb01cally, hyperosmolarity induced by D-mannitol sup-\nplementation induced increases in intracellular Ca\n2+that\ncould be suppressed by 1 mmol/l L-carnitine (Fig. 5B, C).\nThis inhibitory effect is similar to the one described in\nHCjEC [ 11]. (3) However, L-carnitine is not such an\neffective antagonist as CPZ since at a concentration 100-\nfold higher than CPZ L-carnitine had inhibitory effects on\nFig. 5 L-carnitine suppressed hypertonic stress-induced increases\nof intracellular Ca2+concentration.

Turan et al.\nTRPV1 activation that were smaller than those induced\nby CPZ.\nTRPV1 activation by injury contributes to increases in\nHCK cell migration and suppression of TRPV1 activity by\nL-carnitine inhibited HCK migration. Similarly, this\nresponse also affects control of the HCK phenotype sinceL-carnitine also reduced keratocyte transdifferentiation into\nmyo\ufb01broblasts (Fig. 7). The role of L-carnitine in mod-\nulating cell migration was clari \ufb01ed based on showing that\nL-carnitine already slightly decelerated HCK cell migration\nover an 8 h period (Fig. 6A\u2013D, E). This inhibitory effect\nbecame more pronounced after 24 h (Fig. 6G, J, L). In\nanother study, loss of TRPV1 function impaired healing of\nan incision stromal wound in mice [ 3,31]. This delay wasattributed to a lessening of \u03b1SMA upregulation, fewer\nterminally differentiated myo \ufb01broblasts delimiting the\nwound edge and less TGF \u03b2upregulation [ 3]. These differ-\nences may indicate that functional TRPV1 expression\ncontributes to controlling the HCK phenotype since\nL-carnitine blunted increases in myo \ufb01broblast transdiffer-\nentiation induced by TGF \u03b2stimulation of TRPV1, albeit to\na lesser extent than CPZ (Fig. 7). Our \ufb01ndings support\nseveral preliminary studies showing that blockingTRPV1 suppressed myo \ufb01broblast formation and expression\nof TGF \u03b21 in cultured keratocytes or ocular \ufb01broblasts\n[31,32].

Taken together, L-carnitine is a\nTRPV1 channel antagonist (Fig. 8) that is less ef \ufb01cacious\nthan CPZ in inhibiting HCK migration and transdiffer-\nentiation into myo \ufb01broblasts.\nPossible clinical relevance\nLoss of corneal transparency is a leading cause of blindness\nworldwide. Such losses can occur subsequent to either\npenetrating corneal wounds or stromal infections. Suchstresses can increase the conversion of keratocytes and\n\ufb01broblasts into terminally differentiated myo \ufb01broblasts,\nthereby leading to extracellular matrix remodeling, \ufb01brosis,\nand opaci \ufb01cation. Novel strategies are needed to block these\nTRPV1 mediated responses induced by TRPV1 activation.The results of the current study suggest that blocking\nTRPV1 activation on keratocytes with antagonists such as\ncarnitine may prove to be a viable approach to suppresscorneal opaci \ufb01cation in a clinical setting.\nData availability\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study\nare available from the corresponding author on reasonablerequest.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Michaela Zorn-Kruppa (Uni-\nversity Hospital, Hamburg) for providing the HCK cell line.
