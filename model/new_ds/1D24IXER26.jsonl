The clinical performances include muscle weak -\nness, systemic bone pain, standing difficulty, even falls and fractures, etc., which seriously affect the patient\u2019s life \nand work. The pathological mechanism of the OS may be the abnormal metabolism which disrupts the equilibrium \nstability of the musculoskeletal system. Therefore, this study combined vitamin D (Vit. D) and whole-body vibra-\ntion training (WBVT) to intervene in subjects of OS, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the diagnosis \nand treatment protocol and to explore the efficacy mechanism.\nMethods We propose a multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vit. D combined \nwith WBVT intervention in OS. Subjects who met the inclusion or exclusion criteria and signed the informed consent \nform would be randomly assigned to the WBVT group, Vit. D group, or WBVT+ Vit. D group. All subjects will be treated \nfor 1 month and followed up after 3 and 6 months. The primary outcomes are lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) \nand appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and handgrip \nstrength measured by grip strength meter. Secondary outcomes include serum markers of myostatin (MSTN), irisin \nand bone turnover markers (BTM), SARC-CalF questionnaire, 1-min test question of osteoporosis risk, patient health \nstatus (evaluated by the SF-36 health survey), physical performance measurement that includes 5-time chair stand \ntest, 6-m walk, and the short physical performance battery (SPPB).\nDiscussion If Vit. D combined with WBVT can well relieve OS symptoms without adverse effects, this protocol may \nbe a new treatment strategy for OS. After therapeutic intervention, if the serum marker MSTN/irisin is significant, \nboth have the potential to become sensitive indicators for screening OS effective drugs and treatments, which \nalso indicates that WBVT combined with Vit. D plays a role in improving OS by regulating MSTN/irisin.\n\u2020Wenxiong Li, Menghan Chen, and Feifei Chen contributed equally to this \nwork and share first authorship.\n*Correspondence:\nKuaiqiang Zhang\n931799062@qq.com\nFeng Yang\nyangfengdudu@163.com\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 11 Li\u00a0et\u00a0al.

Studies have shown that \nbone mass and muscle fiber numbers in humans peak \nat age 30 and 35 years, declining slowly with increasing \nage, so the incidence of SP and OP increases significantly \nwith the aging of the population [1]. In recent years, \nthe epidemiological data on SP in the Chinese popula -\ntion showed that the prevalence of SP in the community \nelderly is 8.9\u201338.8%, the prevalence of men is higher than \nwomen [2]. The prevalence of OP in people over 50 years \nold was 20.7% in women, 14.4% in men, and the preva -\nlence increased significantly over 60 years old, especially \nin women [3]. The musculoskeletal system is a dynamic \nenvironment. Muscle and bone are two main compo -\nnents of the musculoskeletal system; both of them are \nderived from the mesoderm and are adjacent in physio -\nlogical and anatomical positions, belonging to the motor \nsystem [4, 5]. Muscle and bone are two main components \nof the musculoskeletal system, both of them are derived \nfrom the mesoderm and are adjacent in physiological and \nanatomical positions, belonging to the motor system [4, \n5]. Muscles and bones are not only providers and objects \nof mechanical load, but both are endocrine organs. Mus -\ncle and bone have the interaction of myogenic factors \nand bone factors in cells and molecules, and there is an \ninseparable close relationship between them in genetics, \nphysiology, and anatomy [6\u201310]. Muscle and bone are \nthe physiological, pathophysiological basis of SP and OP , \nand they contain each other to maintain musculoskeletal \ndynamic balance [11].\nTherefore, based on musculoskeletal correlation stud -\nies and the co-pathogenesis of SP and OP , Binkley et\u00a0al. \nproposed the concept of OS [12]. However, at present, \nonly a small amount of experts have proposed diagnos -\ntic criteria for OS, mostly based on the diagnostic criteria \nthat meet both SP and OP [13]. After studying the inter -\nrelationship between muscle and bone, providing certain \nintervention treatments for diseases related to reduced \nmuscle mass and bone mass can effectively reduce the \ndisability and mortality rate of OS and improve the qual -\nity of life for the elderly. OS belongs to age proliferative \ndisease, and clinical single treatment of SP or OP is com -\nmon. Combining bone with muscle\u2019s common target to \nintervene comprehensively is the etiology treatment \nof OS. Studies show that moderate exercise and drug treatment benefit the remission of OS and improve the \nprognosis [14]. Vitamin D (Vit. D) is one of the impor -\ntant basic components of healthy bones. Besides Vit. D\u2019s \nestablished promoting role in calcium and phosphate \nhomeostasis, it can act on osteocytes directly and pro -\nmote bone mineralization [15]. Vit. D promotes mus -\ncle and bone health by the muscle-bone axis, and it can \nregulate the expression of muscle and bone factors posi -\ntively and regulate the injury regeneration of muscle and \nbone resorption bidirectionally [15]. And Vit. D plays an \nindispensable role in the physiological function of skele -\ntal- and muscle-related diseases [16]. Whole-body vibra -\ntion training (WBVT) is a rehabilitation training method, \nwhich induces neuromuscular reflex through mechanical \nvibration and external resistance load, promotes muscle \ncontraction, and gives bone repetitive stress stimulation \nto improve the structure and function of the musculo -\nskeletal system [17]. It is mostly directly used in muscle, \nbone, nerve, and other aspects.\nAt present, our understanding of OS pathophysiology \nand diagnosis and treatment is still insufficient, and more \nhigh-quality clinical research is needed [18]. In this study, \na multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial was used to ver -\nify the efficacy of Vit. D combined with WBVT to improve \nOS. The results of this study will provide some evidence \nsupport for the clinical use of WBVT and Vit. D interven -\ntion in OS, and enrich the clinical treatment of OS.\nObjectives {7}\nThis study is a multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial \nto evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vit. D supplements \ncombined with WBVT on OS.\nTrial design {8}\nThe trial design is a prospective, multicenter, parallel-\ngroup randomized trial. The study is a three-armed supe -\nriority interventional study comparing the therapeutic \neffects of Vit. D supplements combined with WBVT \non OS. Eligible participants would be randomized \n1:1:1 to one of three parallel groups (Vit.D, WBVT, \nWBVT +Vit.D), and they could withdraw at any stage. \nThe group receives Vit. D active drug calcitriol 0.25 \u03bcg, \nWBVT, or calcitriol combined with WBVT for 1 month. \nAfter randomization, the Clinical Study Coordinator \n(CRC) will schedule treatment sessions. All recruit -\nment procedures would be documented in the log file. \nThis trial protocol uses the Standard Protocol Items: \nPage 3 of 11\n Li\u00a0et\u00a0al. Trials          (2024) 25:638 \n \nRecommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) \nreporting guidance [19]. Figure\u00a01 for the study flowchart.\nMethods: participants, interventions, \nand\u00a0outcomes\nStudy setting {9}\nPatients will be collected at four university-affiliated hos -\npitals in Shaanxi Province, China: (1) Affiliated Hospi -\ntal of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, (2) Xi\u2019an \nHonghui Hospital, (3) Xi\u2019an Hospital of Traditional \nChinese Medicine, and (4) Baoji Hospital of Traditional \nChinese Medicine. The clinical trial will be conducted \nin these four hospitals because they have complete \nexamination and treatment facilities. Enrolled patients \nwill receive follow-up, clinical examination, and fill out \nquestionnaires at the orthopedic clinics of these four \nhospitals.\nEligibility criteria {10}\nDiagnostic criteria\nSP diagnostic criteria based on the \u201cChinese expert \nconsensus on diagnosis and treatment for elderly with \nsarcopenia (2021) [2]. \u201d DXA was used to detect the \nappendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) of the limbs, \ngrip strength instrument to detect the muscle strength of \nthe limbs, 5-time chair stand test, 6-m walk, and SPPB \nto diagnose physical performance. The consensus cutoffs for low muscle strength, low muscle mass, and low physi -\ncal performance in sarcopenia diagnosis are as follows: \nhandgrip < 28.0 kg for men and < 18.0 kg for women, \nmuscle mass < 7.0 kg/m2 in men and < 5.4 kg/m2 in \nwomen, 5-time chair stand test \u2265 12 s, 56-m walk < 1.0 \nm/s and SPPB \u2264 9 [2]. OP diagnostic criteria based on \nthe \u201cGuidelines for the diagnosis and management of pri -\nmary osteoporosis(2022) [3]. \u201d The guideline indicates that \nthe BTM level can assess the efficacy of anti-OP drugs, \nand the inhibition of bone turnover reflects that anti-\nbone resorption therapy is effective. OP can be diagnosed \nby high bone turnover type, bone mineral density (BMD) \nT-value \u2264 \u2212 2.5, and 1-min test question of osteoporo -\nsis risk [3]. Subjects who meet the diagnostic criteria for \nboth SP and OP can be diagnosed with OS and enrolled \nin the trial.\nInclusion criteria\nBased on the age of 55\u201385 years, the subjects were \nrequired to meet the diagnostic criteria of both SP and \nOP and sign the informed consent to complete this clini -\ncal study.\nExclusion criteria\nSubjects with severe chronic diseases such as hyper -\ntension and tumors; serious involvement of heart, liver, \nkidney, and other organs; or endocrine and hematologic \ndiseases are not suitable to be enrolled. Subjects with a \nhistory of lumbar or hip surgery, fracture, or other sec -\nondary osteoporosis are not eligible for enrollment. Indi -\nviduals who cannot complete the specified inspection \ntest, such as DXA, are not suitable for enrollment. Sub -\njects who have taken Vit. D or anti-osteoporosis drugs \nfor the last 3 months are not eligible for enrollment. Sub -\njects who also participate in other clinical trials and other \nunsuitable situations judged by the investigator will not \nparticipate in this study.\nWho will take informed consent? {26a}\nTrained research assistants from four hospitals will first \nexplain the purpose and requirements of our program \nin detail to eligible participants. The assistant will also \nobtain written informed consent from all participants \nprior to their participation in the study.\nAdditional consent provisions for\u00a0collection and\u00a0use \nof\u00a0participant data and\u00a0biological specimens {26b}\nThe informed consent has included participants\u2019 permis -\nsion for the use of collected data. Further analysis of bio -\nlogical specimens does not apply to this study.\nFig. 1 Flow diagram of the recruitment process, group allocation, \nand participation in the three interventions. All participants who \ncompleted a follow-up were included in the corresponding analysis\nPage 4 of 11 Li\u00a0et\u00a0al. Trials          (2024) 25:638 \nInterventions\nExplanation for\u00a0the\u00a0choice of\u00a0comparators {6b}\nThe studies have found that both Vit. D supplementa -\ntion and whole body vibration training seem to have an \neffect on OS, so whether Vit. D supplementation and \nWBVT are more effective in OS, or whether they are \nmore effective when used together. Moreover, What is \nthe mechanism of action of Vit. D and WBVT on OS? \nTherefore, Vit. D and WBVT were selected as compara -\ntors for the intervention in OS in this trial.\nIntervention description {11a}\nEligible participants will be randomly assigned to three \nparallel groups. WBVT group: 3 times a week, 10~20 \nmin per time, the first intensity is 5 Hz, vibration for 1 \nmin, rest for 1 min, and increase the frequency by 1Hz \nevery week. Vit. D group: take the Vit. D active drug \ncalcitriol, oral 0.25 \u03bcg, 1 time per day. Vit. D+ WBVT \ngroup: WBVT combined with calcitriol, in the same \nmethod as before. All subjects will be treated for 1 \nmonth and followed up after 3 and 6 months at four \nhospitals.\nCriteria for\u00a0discontinuing or\u00a0modifying allocated \ninterventions {11b}\n\u2460 If the subjects request to withdraw from the clinical \ninvestigator and request the doctor to suspend the clini -\ncal study, the clinical study of the case can be suspended. \n\u2461 Poor compliance or huge differences and deviations in \nthe test process, resulting in incomplete data collection. \n\u2462 Subjects with serious complications that may continue \nto worsen after the trial should be judged by the physi -\ncian before deciding whether to continue the study. \u2463 \nDuring the trial, subjects developed fragility fractures \nand could be withdrawn from the study after a physician\u2019s \njudgment.\nStrategies to\u00a0improve adherence to\u00a0interventions {11c}\nTo improve adherence to the intervention protocol, \nthe staff members of the four hospitals are informed \nabout the study, through oral resentations and WeChat \nmoments at their departments. Subjects participating \nin this trial will receive free physical examination, bone \nmineral density test, and related blood index test from \nclinicians.\nRelevant concomitant care permitted or\u00a0prohibited \nduring\u00a0the\u00a0trial {11d}\nParticipants remain on their standard treatment and \nmedication procedures throughout the study period, and clinicians are advised to manage participants in the usual \nmanner subject to the caveats outlined above.\nProvisions for\u00a0post\u2011trial care {30}\nn/a. Not applicable, since ancillary and post-trial care is \nprovided within the standard care.\nOutcomes {12}\nPrimary outcome\nLumbar spine BMD testing The diagnosis of OP is \nmainly based on the levels of the lumbar spine, hip, and \nforearm BMD and/or fragility fractures. For postmeno -\npausal women and men over 50 years old, the WHO \ndiagnostic criteria of lumbar spine BMD are recom -\nmended and based on DXA measurements (Table\u00a0 1). The \ndiagnostic criteria for OP based on DXA measurement of \nlumbar BMD is T-value \u2264 2.5 [3].\nSkeletal muscle mass DXA is a noninvasive muscle mass \nmeasurement instrument, and the muscle mass measure -\nment standard is based on height-adjusted muscle mass \nto determine the best way to measure muscle mass [limb \nmuscle mass (kg)/height2  (m2)]. The consensus cutoffs for \nlow muscle mass in sarcopenia diagnosis are as follows: < \n7.0 kg/m2 in men and < 5.4 kg/m2 in women by DXA [2].\nMuscle strength Upper limb grip strength is the evalua -\ntion index of handgrip strength. A grip strength device is \nthe most commonly used tool, in order to avoid manual \nreading errors, we will use a digital display electronic grip \nstrength device to guarantee the accuracy of the data. For \nthe test, the subject uses the dominant hand to grip with \nmaximum strength, and the test is performed at least 2 \ntimes, the maximum value is selected. The consensus \nrecommends low muscle strength diagnostic cutoffs of \nhandgrip < 28.0 kg for men and < 18.0 kg for women [2].\nSecondary outcome\nSARC\u2011CalF questionnaire SARC-CalF is a modi -\nfied version of SARC-F, the screening tool of choice \nTable 1 BMD classification criteria based on DXA measurement\nT\u2011value Classification\n\u2265 \u2212 1.0 Normal\n\u2212 2. 5~\u2212 1.0 Low bone mass\n\u2264 \u2212 2.5 Osteoporosis\n\u2264 \u2212 2.5 + fragility fractures Severe osteoporosis\nPage 5 of 11\n Li\u00a0et\u00a0al. Trials          (2024) 25:638 \n \nfor SP , and includes muscle strength (S), assistance in \nwalking(A), rise from a chair(R), climb stairs(C), num -\nber of falls (F), and calf circumference. It was shown that \nthe SARC-CalF has a new additional item: calf circum -\nference compared to the previous version, which signifi -\ncantly improves the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of \nscreening for SP in the elderly. A calf circumference of < \n34 cm in men and < 33 cm in women is considered posi -\ntive. A total of SARC-CalF scores \u2265 11 is considered posi -\ntive for SP [20, 21].\nOne\u2011minute test question of osteoporosis risk One-min -\nute test question of osteoporosis risk are used to initially \nscreen subjects who may be at risk for OP based on a \nbrief patient history, but cannot be used for OP diagnosis \n[22].\nAssessment of patient health status The SF-36 is a \nuniversal scale developed by the American Medical \nResearch Group to measure quality of life and is a com -\nprehensive indicator of individual health status, which is \nwidely accepted and used internationally. The SF-36 has \nbeen shown to have good reliability and validity in the \nelderly population [23]. The SF-36 consists of 36 items, \n35 of which are used in the calculation of eight separate \nscale scores. The physical functioning scale (10 items) is \nthe longest scale. The general health and mental health \nscales have five items each and the vitality and role physi -\ncal scales have four items each. The role emotional scale \nhas three items and the bodily pain and social function -\ning scales have two items each. The remaining item of \nthe SF-36 is a health transition question that asks about \nchanges in general health over the past 12 months [14]. \nThis questionnaire will be completed at all the measure -\nment points (baseline, 1 month after the treatment, 3 and \n6 months of follow-up) [24].\nPhysical performance There are several methods cur -\nrently used to test physical performance, including \n5-time chair stand test, 6-m walk, and SPPB.\nFive\u2011time chair stand test The 5-time chair stand test \n[25] can be used as a simple alternative method to meas -\nure lower limb strength, focusing on the determina -\ntion of quadriceps group strength. A seat with a height \nof about 46 cm was used for the measurement, and the \ntime required for the subject to complete five consecu -\ntive up-sit movements at the fastest speed without using \nthe arms was recorded, and the experiment was repeated \nthree times to take the average of the calculated times [2].\nSix\u2011meter walk Walking speed is the simplest, fastest, \nand safest method of assessing physical performance. It is measured by instructing the subject to pass through a \ncertain test area at a regular walking speed without accel -\nerating or decelerating midway, and measuring it at least \ntwice and calculating its average value. Six-meter walk -\ning speed experiment \u2264 1.0 m/s indicates a decrease in \nphysical performance [2].\nThe short physical performance battery The SPPB is a \ncomprehensive physical performance test that includes \nan assessment of gait speed, a balance test, and a chair \nstand test. The individual test scores were 4 points and \nthe total score was 12 points. A score of SPPB \u2264 9 points \nindicates poor physical performance [2].\nDetection of serum markers of irisin, MSTN, Vit. D, and \nbone turnover markers BTM reflect the rate of bone \nresorption and formation, which will be measured with \nVit. D by the Laboratory Department of the Affiliated \nHospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine \n(ISO15189 certified). Serum irisin and MSTN levels will \nbe measured by this researcher with ELISA kits.\nParticipant timeline {13}\nThe study flowchart is illustrated in Fig.\u00a01.\nSample size {14}\nBMD will be employed as the primary outcome for sam -\nple size estimation. Based on the result of relevant stud -\nies [26], the difference in BMD between the two groups \nis 0.88. It is estimated that a sample size of 24 in each \ngroup will have 90% power to detect a significant differ -\nence using variance analysis with a 0.05 significance level. \nTo account for an anticipated dropout of 20%, we further \nincrease the sample size to n = 30 for each arm (total n = \n90).\nRecruitment {15}\nSubjects were required to complete the SARC-CalF ques -\ntionnaire to determine whether they had possible SP , \nwhile completing the International Osteoporosis Foun -\ndation (IOF) 1-min test question of osteoporosis risk to \ndetermine whether they had possible OP . Subjects would \nbe further tested for positive results on both the SARC-\nCalF questionnaire and 1-min test question of osteopo -\nrosis risk.\nAssignment of\u00a0interventions: allocation\nSequence generation {16a}\nA total of 90 patients will be enrolled. Participants will be \nrandomized into 1:1:1 allocation, blocked randomization \nwith 30 participants in the vitamin D group, 30 partici -\npants in the WBVT group, and 30 participants in the Vit. \nPage 6 of 11 Li\u00a0et\u00a0al. Trials          (2024) 25:638 \nD + WBVT group. The randomization will be done using \na computer randomization program before the interven -\ntion. This will be overseen by a biostatistician who is not \ninvolved in the recruitment of patients and data analysis. \nHence, the patients and research personnel are blinded \nuntil the start of treatment.\nConcealment mechanism {16b}\nAllocation concealment will be ensured as the computer \nrandomization program will not release the randomiza -\ntion code until the patient has been recruited into the \ntrial. Because patients are treated differently, it is not \npossible to blind subjects and researchers, but data col -\nlection and analysis are done by dedicated statisticians. \nSubjects and researchers are blind to data, and statisti -\ncians are blind to study grouping.\nImplementation {16c}\nThe principal investigator will enroll participants. The \ncomputer randomization program will generate the allo -\ncation sequence at a 1:1:1 ratio. An independent research \nstaff will assign participants to interventions.\nAssignment of\u00a0interventions: blinding\nWho will be blinded {17a}\nDue to the characteristics and design of interventional \nstudies, participants and researchers were not blinded \nto interventions; data analysts, however, will be blinded \nto the assignment of interventions. Outcome evaluation \nand statistical analysis will be performed by independent \ninvestigators who are blinded to patient allocation.\nProcedure for\u00a0unblinding if\u00a0needed {17b}\nBlinding is not applicable to this trial.\nData collection and\u00a0management\nPlans for\u00a0assessment and\u00a0collection of\u00a0outcomes {18a}\nThe primary outcomes are lumbar BMD and ASM meas -\nured by DXA and handgrip strength measured by grip \nstrength meter. Secondary outcomes include serum \nmarkers of myostatin (MSTN), Irisin and BTM, SARC-\nCalF questionnaire, 1-min test question of Osteoporosis \nrisk, patient health status (evaluated by the SF-36 health \nsurvey), physical performance measurement (measured \nby 5-time chair stand test, 6-m walk, and SPPB ) and \nadverse events (AEs) as reported in the trial. All indica -\ntors were measured at baseline and after 6 months of \nfollow-up, and some measures were measured after 1 \nmonth of treatment and 3 months of follow-up, as shown \nin Table\u00a02.Plans to\u00a0promote participant retention and\u00a0complete \nfollow\u2011up {18b}\nTo promote participant retention, the participant will be \nassigned to one investigator who is in contact with the \nparticipant during the whole study and who will perform \nthe measurements. Patients will be contacted weekly \nfor their intake of the intervention and 1 week before \nthe assessment to enhance the attendance rate. Special \nassessment sessions on the weekend or in the evening \nwill be arranged under special circumstances to enhance \nsubject compliance. Patients who default a scheduled \nappointment will be contacted by the investigators to re-\narrange another appointment within 1 week.\nData management {19}\nClinical data will be collected and recorded by trained \nresearch assistants in our research center.

The funder has no role or restriction \nin the decision of publication.\nDiscussion\nSP is a progressive, systemic skeletal muscle disease asso -\nciated with aging, characterized by a decrease in overall \nmuscle mass, muscle strength, and/or physical perfor -\nmance. SP is closely related to activity disorders, falls, low \nBMD, and metabolic disorders, and is one of the impor -\ntant reasons and manifestations of the gradual decline of \nphysiological function in the elderly [27, 28]. OP is the \nmost common bone disease, which is a metabolic bone \ndisease characterized by reduced bone mass and bone \nmicrostructure damage of bone tissue, increased bone \nfragility, and susceptibility to fracture [29]. The combi -\nnation of the pathological characteristics of OP and OS \nmakes OS\u2019s prevalence have a progressive increase with \nthe onset of global aging [30]. The results of a two-way \nMendelian randomization study [31] showed that there is \na direct causal relationship between the BMD of femoral \nneck, lumbar spine, forearm, and ASM, with a stronger \ncorrelation between ASM and lumbar spine BMD. Clini -\ncal studies have shown [32] that SP is not only a loss of \nASM but also muscle strength and function, and that \ngrip strength is the most important test for SP and is \nsignificantly associated with OP . OS increases the risk \nof homeostatic imbalance in the musculoskeletal sys -\ntem [33]. To better prevent and treat OS, this study will \nenrich the clinical treatment of OS by using a multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial to verify the efficacy of phar -\nmacological interventions combined with exercise ther -\napy to improve OS.\nVit. D promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and \nphosphorus and plays an important regulatory role in \ncalcium homeostasis and bone health. The results of a \nrandomized controlled trial showed that active Vit. D \nsignificantly improved physical performance and lumbar \nspine BMD and reduced the risk of falls in subjects, com -\npared to stable Vit. D [34]. Bischoff-Ferrari HA and part -\nners concluded that Vit. D may improve musculoskeletal \nfunction by affecting factors directly related to ASM, in \naddition to enhancing BMD [35]. Vit. D indirectly affects \nmuscle function and reduces the incidence of SP by reg -\nulating the proliferation and differentiation, the balance \nof calcium and phosphorus metabolism, and the energy \nmetabolism of myocytes. Vit. D also plays an impor -\ntant regulatory role in cardiovascular diseases, diabe -\ntes, autoimmune diseases, and so on, providing a strong \nguarantee for the health of the elderly, especially for the \nprevention and treatment of OS in the elderly [36, 37].\nIn this study, Vit. D combined with WBVT was chosen \nto intervene in OS. Exercise is one of the effective means \nto modulate aging diseases, a large body of research evi -\ndence shows [38] that WBVT is effective in improving \nBMD and preventing further bone loss in patients with \nOP , thus limiting the risk of fracture. The acute effect of \nexercise induces the ability to mediate the interaction of \nmuscle, bone, and endocrine systems to enhance ASM \nand bone strength by generating physical forces through \nexercise, external devices, and so on, which in turn stim -\nulate the secretion of growth and biochemical factors \n[39].\nThe result of metabolic exercise is an increase in mus -\ncle mass and bone strength, which are both influenced \nby changes in external mechanical load and each other. \nMuscles release a variety of endocrine factors that pro -\nmote bone formation and stimulate the increase of bone \nstrength and bone density through muscle contraction \n[38]. The WBVT selected in this study can stimulate \nosteoprogenitor-osteoblast activity [40, 41] and increase \nthe levels of various sex hormones and cytokines. It is \noften used clinically to act directly on nerve, muscle, and \nskeletal structures, helping to enhance muscle endur -\nance, BMD, and improve balance function. The WBVT is \nmostly used in the rehabilitation of elderly populations, \nwhich is particularly effective in musculoskeletal degen -\nerative diseases such as OS.\nModern medical research has revealed that the core \npathological mechanism of OS is the synergistic degen -\neration of skeletal muscle and bone, and its musculo -\nskeletal relationship is closely linked to several aspects \nsuch as biomechanical, endocrine, and signaling \nPage 9 of 11\n Li\u00a0et\u00a0al. Trials          (2024) 25:638 \n \npathways [ 42]. MSTN [43] is an actin secreted by skele -\ntal muscle, and its elevated plasma levels increase skel -\netal muscle fibrosis and cause muscle atrophy. MSTN \ncan lead to the decline of skeletal muscle mass by reg -\nulating the division cycle of myoblasts, the expression \nof myogenic regulators, and so on, finally inducing SP . \nMSTN can also affect bone metabolism by regulating \nthe differentiation of osteoblast (OB), osteoclast (OC), \nand bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and is an \nimportant factor in the regulation between muscle and \nbone [44, 45]. Peng et\u00a0al [46] found that skeletal muscle \nmass decreased gradually with age, but serum MSTN \nexpression level increased with age, which shows serum \nMSTN is negatively correlated with skeletal muscle \nmass. MSTN downregulates the Wnt pathway to inhibit \nOB differentiation and formation, regulates the Smad2 \npathway to promote OC formation, inhibits bone \nmetabolism, and reduces BMD [47, 48]. Torres-Costoso \net\u00a0 al [49] concluded that skeletal muscle mass is an \nimportant influence factor on BMD. Therefore, MSTN \ncan affect BMD by reducing skeletal muscle mass and \nthus can be used as a detection index for OS.\nCounterbalancing MSTN is irisin, which can reduce \nthe negative effects of MSTN on musculoskeletal metab -\nolism, and the two intermodulate to balance skeletal \nmuscle mass and osteogenesis levels [50, 51]. Irisin can \nimprove bone metabolism by acting directly on bone \ncells or regulating bone gene expression [52]. Several \nstudies have shown [53\u201355] that irisin can directly target \nOB, upregulate the expression levels of key OB transcrip -\ntion factors activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and \nrunt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and increase \nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposi -\ntion, thus promoting OB differentiation. Irisin can inhibit \nOC formation by decreasing receptor activators for \nnuclear factor-\u03ba B ligand (RANKL) expression. Irisin pro -\nmotes the proliferation of BMSCs and OB differentiation \nthrough the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway [56], which \nis related positively to BMD [57]. Irisin positively acts on \nthe musculoskeletal system and has the potential to be a \nsensitive indicator for screening effective drugs and treat -\nments for OS [58].\nThe results of clinical studies have shown that serum \nbiochemical indicators such as P1NP , S-CTX, and Vit. \nD are important indicators reflecting the condition of \nelderly patients with OP combined with SP [59]. And \nBTM levels are the best detectors of clinical response \nto the rate of bone resorption and formation, so in this \nstudy, serum levels of BTM series, irisin, MSTN, and Vit. \nD were measured to investigate their effects on musculo -\nskeletal production by affecting the energy conversion of \nthe body and to analyze their significant correlation with \nthe development of OS.SP and OP are two diseases closely related to aging, \nwith similar risk factors such as mechanical, genetic, and \nendocrine, and often occur together, which are clinically \nreferred to as OS. In this study, a multicenter, parallel-\ngroup clinical trial design was selected, and eligible sub -\njects were randomly assigned to the WBVT group, Vit. D \ngroup, and WBVT + Vit. D group, refer to the \u201cChinese \nexpert consensus on diagnosis and treatment for elderly \nwith sarcopenia (2021)\u201d and \u201cGuidelines for the diagnosis \nand management of primary osteoporosis(2022). \u201d From \nthis research trial, we may conclude that (1) WBVT com -\nbined with Vit. D can promote the healthy development \nof the musculoskeletal system, and both combinations \nare significantly more effective and safer than monother -\napy in the treatment of OS. (2) Muscle-derived factors \nirisin and MSTN are antagonistic factors that play oppo -\nsite regulatory roles in the diagnosis and treatment of SP \nand OP and can be used as a diagnostic index of OS. (3) \nWBVT combined with Vit. D plays a role in improving \nOS by regulating irisin/MSTN. Currently, there is a lack \nof drugs or means to the common targets of SP and OP in \nclinical practice. This study can enrich OS\u2019s diagnosis and \ntreatment targets, improve the diagnosis and treatment \nrate, and improve the elderly life quality. At the same \ntime, it provides a scientific basis for the clinical use of \ncomprehensive therapies to prevent and treat OS and has \nan important role in promoting the progress of medical \nand health technology in China.\nTrial status\nEthical approval of the primary review committee \n(Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Tradi -\ntional Chinese Medicine) was received on May 10, \n2023 (SZFYIEC-PJ-No. 41 of 2023).
