Fever as a primary manifestation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is uncommon with few cases reported in the literature. Here we present an unusual case of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma primarily manifesting as pyrexia of unknown origin. A 63-year-old Sri Lankan male, a non-smoker who was diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia presented with a history of fever, anorexia and weight loss for 2 months. Despite the completion of treatment for positive serology for paratyphi, \nhis symptoms and inflammatory markers remained elevated while the rest of the infectious screening was negative. On further evaluation, the patient was found to have a hypodense distal pancreas with ring-enhancing multiple liver lesions on imaging. Histology confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis. Atypical liver metastases may present with evidence of ring enhancement in computed tomography imaging; thus, the biopsy is mandatory for diagnosis and decision-making. Usually, tumours of the pancreatic tail are resectable but if they are associated with liver metastatic disease, surgical resection is not recommended because it is not potentially curative. Therefore, in the context of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, palliative chemotherapy and pharmacological management of fever are required.\nKeywords\nFever of unknown origin, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, liver metastases\nDate received: 16 April 2024; accepted: 6 June 2024\n1 University Surgical Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri \nLanka\n2 Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, \nColombo, Sri Lanka\n3 Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, \nColombo, Sri Lanka\nCorresponding Author:Duminda Subasinghe, Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, 25, Kynsey Road, Colombo 08, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka.

Over the 8 weeks, the fever \npersisted alongside dry cough, malaise, loss of appetite, loss \nof weight and more recent occurrences of feeling unfit. He denied experiencing gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. His general and system examination was unremarkable. Notably, he had no rashes or joint swellings and exhibited no neurological signs.\nInitially, he was evaluated at the medical unit for PUO. \nHis basic haematology revealed a neutrophil leucocytosis (white blood cells: 24,470 \u00d7 10\n9/L, neutrophils: 81.0%) and \nelevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 164.3 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 63 mm/first \nhour and procalcitonin: 8.650 ng/ml). His blood and urine \ncultures, as well as viral screening for Influenza A, B, COVID-19, and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) were negative (Table 1).\nAutoimmune and systemic vasculitis were ruled out \nthrough repeated autoimmune screening tests, including \ntests for antinuclear antibody (ANA), C-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and P-ANCA, all of which returned negative except for ANA. Chest X-ray displayed no lesions. Additionally, the absence of lymph node enlarge-ment and normal serum calcium levels ruled out a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, leading to the decision to halt further pulmo-nary investigations. The serological tests conducted for \nmalaria showed negative. Additionally, 2D echocardiogram, trans-oesophageal echocardiogram and abdominal ultra-sonography were carried out to eliminate the possibility of an underlying cause and were unremarkable.\nOn further evaluation for fever and anorexia, computed \ntomography (CT) abdomen was performed, which revealed a hypodense segment in the pancreas involving the distal body and tail suspicious of malignancy (Figure 1) but with multi-ple ring-enhancing lesions in the liver in favour of infectious aetiology rather than malignancy (Figures 2 and 3). The alpha-fetoprotein level was 2.89 IU/ml and CA 19.9 level \nwas 156.6 U/mL. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy from Table 1.

Hence, the CT-guided biopsy from the liver lesion was done and it confirmed metastatic deposits from known pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Figure 4).\nAfter confirming the diagnosis with the histology, the \npatient was directed to further palliative care. Meanwhile, symptomatic management was done to relieve his symp-toms. Paracetamol was given as and when needed for fever, for which he responded well. In addition, multivitamin sup-plementation was done. His routine medications for other comorbidities were continued. Before he turned up for pal-liative chemotherapy, he succumbed to death.\nDiscussion\nPUO is characterized by a body temperature of \u2a7e 38.3\u00b0C on \nat least two occasions, lasting for \u2a7e 3 weeks or involving mul-\ntiple febrile episodes during this period.4 A diagnosis remains \nelusive despite thorough history-taking and examination, along with comprehensive investigations, including routine blood tests, inflammatory markers, autoimmune screening, cultures, chest radiography and abdominal imaging.\n4 \nNeoplastic fever, characterized by fever caused directly by cancer, is a well-documented phenomenon observed in patients with haematological malignancies, colon cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma.\n3 The diagnostic criteria for neoplastic fever are \nstringent and include temperature over 37.8\u00b0C at least once each day, duration of fever over 2 weeks, lack of evidence of \ninfection on physical examination, laboratory examinations and imaging studies, absence of allergic mechanisms and lack of response of fever to an empiric, adequate antibiotic therapy for at least 7 days.\n5 In our patient, all criteria were fulfilled \nexcept the presence of positive paratyphi serology. However, pyrexia persisted despite adequate course for paratyphi and empirical antibiotics.\nThis phenomenon is more commonly observed in the \nmetastatic setting, particularly when metastases involve the liver.\n6 The underlying mechanism of neoplastic fever is not \nclearly understood. One proposed explanation suggests that in response to a tumour, cancer cells or host cells may gener -\nate specific pyrogenic cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon.\n7 These \ncytokines have the potential to activate the anterior preoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, leading to an elevation in the body temperature set point by inducing prostaglandin E2.\n7 \nAdditional mechanisms contributing to neoplastic fever involve tumour necrosis, the liberation of TNF and the release of other pyrogens from deceased tissue.\n7\nDistinguishing between infectious fever and neoplastic \nfever is crucial, as the timely administration of appropriate antibiotics can significantly impact the outcome of patients with specific infections.\n8 Once the diagnosis of neoplastic \nfever is confirmed, disease-specific treatments such as sur -\ngery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may prove beneficial in alleviating the fever depending on the cancer type.\n9 \nFurthermore, there have been reports indicating the substantial effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the management of neoplastic fever. These drugs include nap-roxen, diclofenac, indomethacin, rofecoxib and ibuprofen.\n3,10\nIn our patient, the diagnosis of PDAC was not suspected \ninitially due to the positivity of paratyphoid serology. Although his inflammatory markers were elevated, serology, culture and imaging for suspected viral and bacterial infec-tions were negative. Serology for autoimmune conditions was negative except for ANA which can be positive in 5% of the general population at 1:80 dilution. In elderly patients experiencing a decline in general health, the possibility of digestive cancers should be considered. While chronic fever is not a primary factor in this diagnostic process, the combi-nation of advanced age and deteriorating health warrants investigation into potential neoplastic causes of digestive ori-gin, typically through imaging studies such as thoraco-abdominal pelvic CT scans. Chronic fever of unknown origin is rare as a symptom in the clinical presentation of digestive cancers. There are several learning points from the reported patient. The patient had unusual ring-enhancing liver lesions which favoured liver abscesses rather than metastases. Therefore, a biopsy of the lesion was crucial for the diagnosis and decision-making regarding the management of PDAC. In this patient, investigation into potential neoplastic causes of digestive origin should have been considered earlier once infective causes are excluded or empirically treated. Unfortunately, owing to the histologically proven liver metas-tases, a curative resection was not feasible and the patient was referred to the oncologist for palliative chemotherapy. Our patient\u2019s fever responded well to oral paracetamol; however, the fever recurred following the withdrawal of the drug.\nFigure 3. Computed tomography abdomen showing multiple \nring-enhancing liver lesions (coronal section).\n4 SAGE Open Medical Case Reports\nConclusion\nWe describe a rare case of metastatic pancreatic adenocar -\ncinoma presenting as a fever of unknown origin. Liver \nmetastases may present atypically as in this patient with evidence of ring enhancement in the CT imaging; thus, the biopsy is mandatory for the diagnosis and decision-making. If the tumour is deemed resectable, surgical inter -\nvention emerges as a secure and potentially curative treatment for both the fever and the underlying carcinoma. However, in the context of metastatic PDAC, palliative chemotherapy and pharmacological management of fever are required.Acknowledgements\nAll the staff members who were involved in the management of this \npatient.\nAuthor contributions\nD.S. designed the case.
