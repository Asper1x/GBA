Bistrian, MD, PhD4SYSTEMATIC REVIEW\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids as Antiarrhythmic Drugs: \nUpstream Target Modulators Affecting Acute \nand Long-Term Pathological Alterations in \nCardiac Structure and Function\nOBJECTIVES: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication \nin the acute care period following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery \nthat is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in both short-term and \nlong-term settings. Recently, the Vaughn Williams Classification of antiarrhythmic \nagents, first proposed in 1975 and widely viewed as the authoritative description \nof their electrophysiologic actions, was updated and notably omega-3 fatty acids \n(\u03a9-3 fatty acids) have been included in class VII, described as \u201cupstream target \nmodulators, \u201d to mitigate pathological structural and electrophysiological remodel-\ning changes in the aged and/or injured myocardium.\nDATA SOURCES: A PubMed literature search was performed.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Studies examining the significance of complications in \npatients undergoing isolated CABG surgery were selected for inclusion.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Relevant data were qualitatively assessed and narratively \nsummarized.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: POAF occurs in approximately 30% of patients, and inflam-\nmation from chronic coronary artery disease preoperatively, as well as acute atrial \ninflammation from surgery postoperatively are the leading causes. Inflammation \nunderlies its pathophysiology; therefore \u03a9-3 fatty acids not only exhibit antiar-\nrhythmic properties but are an effective anti-inflammatory treatment that may re-\nduce the clinical risks of POAF.\nCONCLUSIONS: At present no effective prophylaxis is available to address \nPOAF following CABG surgery. Clinical approaches that focus on the inflamma-\ntory response in this setting may optimize the response to treatment. The current \nliterature supports the hypothesis that \u03a9-3 fatty acids may acutely reduce the in-\nflammatory response via favorable alterations in the metabolism of prostaglandins \nand leukotrienes (eicosanoids) and specialized pro-resolving mediators.\nKEY WORDS: atrial fibrillation; coronary artery bypass grafting surgery; \ninflammatory response; omega-3 fatty acids; specialized pro-resolving mediators\nOne of the most significant and recent developments in cardiac medi-\ncine was the publication of \u201cModernized classification of cardiac anti-\narrhythmic drugs\u201d (1). This update was based on the original work \nfrom the renowned pharmacologist and electrophysiologist, E.M.Vaughn \nWilliams, who first described a new antiarrhythmic drug classification system \nin 1975 (2). There were four basic drug classifications (classes I\u2013IV), and he set \nout to categorize known \u201cantidysrhythmic\u201d agents according to their individual \nelectrophysiological and pharmacological actions. He was motivated because \nof a general lack of agreement about the antiarrhythmic drugs available at the \n10522September202322September2023\nDriscoll et al\n2     www.ccejournal.org September 2023 \u2022 Volume 5 \u2022 Number 10time. So, in hopes of providing a \u201cscreen, \u201d or platform, \nfor the development of new compounds, as well as a \ncloser inspection of the modes of action, he felt that \nthe new classification system would advance the field. \nAbout 10 years later (3), he provided an update, where \nhe elegantly described the detailed electrophysiolog-\nical mechanisms of action for drugs within each class \naccording to the type of cardiac rhythm abnormality. \nThe Vaughn William classification system has been \nwidely adopted by major pharmacology (4) and med-\nical (5) textbooks.\nForty-three years later, the \u201cmodernized\u201d version \nwas published, which sought to preserve \u201cthe sim-\nplicity of the Vaughn Williams framework, while aid-\ning in the understanding and clinical management of \ncardiac arrhythmic events and facilitating future de-\nvelopment in this area\u201d (1). Three new classifications \nwere added (V , VI, and VII) to the original framework. \nOf note, a new class VII section entitled, \u201cDrugs act-\ning on upstream modulatory targets\u201d was introduced \nto focus on modifying the impact of long-term path-\nological changes (i.e., \u201cremodeling\u201d) in cardiac tissues. \nStructural alterations in the heart can occur as a result \nof \u201cprimary electrical remodeling, \u201d which occurs in \nresponse to a functional insult, such as an altered se-\nquence of electrical activation. In contrast, \u201csecondary \nelectrical modeling\u201d is the result of a structural insult (6), such as myocardial infarction (MI), or from what \noccurs after cardiac surgery. For example, the authors \nnote (1): \u201cFibrotic change is an important accompa-\nniment to post-infarct healing, potentially leading to \nchronic scar-related arrhythmogenesis, pressure over -\nload, and the development of atrial fibrillation [\u2018 AFib\u2019]. \u201d \nWith age, disruptions at multiple biochemical levels \ncan occur, producing pathological changes in remod-\neling processes (7, 8). Structural remodeling is char -\nacterized by atrial enlargement and tissue fibrosis and \ncan lead to conduction disturbances within the myo-\ncardium, ultimately producing atrial fibrillation (AF), \narising from increased fibrotic changes in the heart.\nAbnormalities in intracellular Ca+2 metabolism can \ntrigger ectopic activity and/or activation of \u201cpro-fibril-\nlatory remodeling, \u201d having direct effects on normal \nsinus rhythm (9). According to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention estimates, \u201cbetween 2.7 and \n6.1 million people in the United States have \u2018 AFib\u2019 and \nwill increase as the population ages\u201d (10). Furthermore, \nit is estimated that 12.1 million people in the United \nStates will have AF in 2030 (11).\nRISKS OF AF IN THE ACUTE \nSURGICAL CARE SETTING\nImportantly, there are also potential clinical risks from \nnew-onset AF in the short-term or acute care setting. \nAny \u201ctrauma\u201d directly related to the heart muscle, such \nas acute MI or cardiac surgery, may also acutely ex-\nacerbate arrhythmogenic consequences. For example, \na canine model to study the effects of cardiac surgery \non conduction disturbances showed that atrial inflam-\nmation was associated with a proportional increase in \nthe duration of AF (12). Moreover, preoperative differ -\nences in the histopathology of atrial tissues (i.e., inter -\nstitial fibrosis, vacuolization, and nuclear derangement \nof myocytes) and the development of postoperative AF \nin patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting \n(CABG) surgery have been demonstrated (13). During \nCABG surgery the initial damage to cardiac tissues \ncaused by ischemia during cardiopulmonary bypass \n(CPB) will induce cell damage by reducing the avail-\nability of oxygen and its impact on energy (adenosine \ntriphosphate) generation. Consequently, to maintain \nthe energy necessary to sustain the heart, it must re-\nvert from aerobic (via oxidation of glucose and lipids) \nto anaerobic (via glycolysis) metabolism which is con-\nsiderably less efficient. The main degradation product  KEY POINTS\nQuestion: What are the prevalence, outcomes, \nand therapy for new-onset postoperative atrial fi-\nbrillation (POAF) following isolated coronary artery \nbypass grafting (CABG) surgery?\nFindings: In the acute care setting based on an ag-\ngregate of five studies involving 336,823 patients, \n30% develop POAF, and significant differences in \nthe risk of mortality following CABG surgery were \nnoted in both the short-term and long-term setting \nconfirmed by a large systematic review and meta-\nanalysis (n = 129,628 patients). Currently, there is \nno effective prophylaxis to prevent POAF immedi-\nately following CABG surgery.\nMeaning: IV administration of precise doses of \nomega-3 fatty acids during the perioperative pe-\nriod may reduce adverse events arising from POAF \nafter CABG surgery.\nSystematic Review\nCritical Care Explorations  www.ccejournal.org     3of anaerobic glycolysis is lactic acid and as it accumu-\nlates over time, it will eventually inhibit glycolysis, \nultimately creating a more severe energy deficit and \ncell damage. During reperfusion, there is increased \nproduction of oxygen-free radicals or reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) coming directly from (reduced) molec-\nular oxygen, as well as being generated from the ox-\nidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids from vegetable \nsources such as soybean oil, a major fat source typical \nin Western diets (14). Oxidation of unsaturated fatty \nacids leads to the formation of both primary oxida-\ntion products (i.e., hydroperoxides and free fatty acids) \nand secondary oxidation products (i.e., aldehydes and \nketones). They can promote oxidative stress as intra-\ncellular messengers (15\u201317), as well as causing cell \ndamage and activating neutrophils and other immune \ncells, ultimately initiating the release of pro-inflamma-\ntory cytokines and the acute phase response (18). Of \npatients who undergo CABG surgery each year, post-\noperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) develops within 48 \nhours, and in the majority of cases, it occurs within 96 \nhours (24).\nThe combination of an aging heart, the need for \nCABG surgery with its implications for pathologic \nchange, and the stress of the associated CPB procedure, \nas well as a pro-inflammatory diet, can often manifest \nin the acute care setting as atrial arrhythmia. In fact, \nthe prevalence of new-onset, POAF in patients under -\ngoing isolated CABG surgery consistently reports an \nprevalence of approximately 30%, as shown in Table 1 .RISKS OF AF IN THE LONG-TERM \nPOSTSURGICAL CARE SETTING\nAs Table\u00a0 1 also shows, the development of POAF is \nassociated with increased mortality long after CABG \nsurgery. In a systematic review and meta-analysis that \nfocused exclusively on isolated CABG surgery (n = \n129,628 patients) and the development of new-onset \nPOAF, there were significant differences in the risk of \nmortality following CABG surgery in both the short-\nterm and long-term analyses after CABG (25). These \nobservations have been confirmed by others (20, 21, \n26). The most recent systematic review and meta-\nanalysis (n = 246,340 patients) showed increased risk \nin the short-term (e.g., postoperative mortality, stroke, \nMI), and long-term (e.g., long-term mortality, stroke, \nand persistent AF) (27). Taken together, recent data \nindicate that new-onset POAF in patients undergoing \nisolated CABG surgery is not a benign event and that \ntherapeutic prevention for the short-term with perma-\nnent avoidance is a desirable goal (28, 29). At present, \nthere is no effective prophylaxis at this time.\nANIMAL STUDIES SUPPORTING ROLE \nOF FISH OIL IN REDUCING PACING-\nINDUCED AF\nDietary omega-3 fatty acids (\u03a9-3 fatty acids) have \nbeen shown to significantly reduce rapid atrial pacing-\ninduced AF vulnerability, possibly via decreasing in-\nflammation and attenuating myocardial endoplasmic \nTABLE 1.\nPrevalence of Acute Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Undergoing Coronary \nArtery Bypass Grafting Surgery\nReference Patients Study Data New-Onset POAF (%) Follow-up (yr) Mortality: POAF Vs NSR \nAhlsson et al (19) 1,419 Single center 29.5 8 (Median) POAF > NSR\nThor\u00e9n et al (20) 7 ,145 Single center 30.6 9.8 (Median) 18% vs 12%a\nFilardo et al (21) 9,203 Four centers 31.5b3.3 (Mean) \u2191 if \u2265 2 atrial fibrillation events\nTaha et al (22) 24,523 Four registries 30.0c4.5 (Median) All causes\u2014not significant\nJawitz et al (23) 294,533 Medicared30.0 3.7 (Median) Significant\nN 336,823 Weighted AVG 30.05  \nAVG = Average, NSR = normal sinus rhythm, POAF = postoperative atrial fibrillation.\nap < 0.001.\nbMale/female weighted average.\nc23.7% prescribed oral anticoagulation without benefit on mortality.\nd1,117 centers.\n\"N\" is the total number of patients from references 19\u201323.\nDriscoll et al\n4     www.ccejournal.org September 2023 \u2022 Volume 5 \u2022 Number 10reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in a canine model \nof AF (30). A fish oil dose of 0.6 g/kg/day in male beagle \ndogs prevented rapid atrial pacing-induced AF due to \ndecreases in the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin \n(IL)-1 \u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) and \ndownregulation of ER stress-related protein expression \nlevels of glucose-regulated protein78, C/EBP homolo-\ngous protein, cleaved-caspase12, and phosphorylation \nof protein kinase R-like ER kinase. Other animal stud-\nies have shown that omega-3 or \u03a9-fatty acids can re-\nduce AF.\nPOSTULATED MECHANISMS FOR \nPOST-CABG AF: SYMPATHETIC TONE, \nINFLAMMATION, AND OXIDATIVE \nSTRESS\nIn the acute situation postoperatively, activation of the \ncomplement system releases C-reactive protein (CRP) \nand pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, \nand TNF-\u03b1 close to the onset of POAF (31). These in-\nflammatory markers result in leukocyte activation and \nrelease oxidases and nitric oxide. Eventually, this leads \nto the generation of ROS that contribute to systemic \ninflammation (32). Postoperative inflammation results \nin differing refractory periods and conduction veloci-\nties in the myocardium which increase susceptibility to \naberrant electrical activity, conduction, and re-entry, \ntermed the \u201canisotropic\u201d atrium (12, 33).\nPOTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR \nBENEFICIAL EFFECT OF \u03a9-3 FATTY \nACIDS POST-CABG\n\u03a9-3 fatty acids can potentially reduce post-CABG AF \ndue to two mechanisms. The first is a net reduction in \ninflammation, which limits fibrosis. Eicosapentaenoic \nacid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the \npreferred substrates that compete with arachidonic \nacid to produce less pro-inflammatory eicosanoids \n(three-series prostanoids and five-series leukotri-\nenes vs two-series and four-series via ARA, respec-\ntively) (34). As mentioned earlier, \u03a9-6 fatty acids are \npredominant in western diets (14) and therefore the \npreoperative CABG patient is often \u201cprimed\u201d for a \npronounced systemic pro-inflammatory response in \nthe postoperative setting. Acute provision of \u03a9-3 fatty \nacids by IV administration rapidly enriches plasma \ncell membranes (leukocyte and platelet phospholipids) within 60 minutes (35) will modulate the intensity of \ninflammatory response. Moreover, \u03a9-3 fatty acids are \nrequired for the biosynthesis of specialized pro-resolv-\ning lipid mediators (SPMs), the downstream products \nof EPA and DHA which are known to reduce inflam-\nmation and include resolvins, protectins, and maresins \n(36\u201338). The second mechanism is an antiarrhythmic \neffect due to the epoxy and hydroxy metabolites de-\nrived from EPA and DHA which have potent antiar -\nrhythmic properties (39).\nSUPPORT FOR THE ROLE OF SPMS IN \nREDUCING INFLAMMATION INVOLVED \nIN CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAtherosclerosis is a disease of chronic inflammation in \nthe arterial wall involving the innate immune system \nand characterized by monocyte and neutrophil infiltra-\ntion and differentiation of monocytes to macrophages \nin the subendothelial space, leading to foam cell and \nfatty streak formation and advanced plaques (40\u201342).\nOn June 20, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA)-approved colchicine as the first anti-inflam-\nmatory therapy preventing the risk of adverse cardiac \nevents (MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and \ndeath) (43) for patients with chronic coronary disease \n(44). The study by Welty et al (45) reported that the \nratio of pro-resolving metabolites of EPA and DHA \nto pro-inflammatory markers was a better predictor \nof progression and regression of coronary plaque than \nthe plasma \u03a9-3 fatty acid index. To explore mecha-\nnisms associated with coronary plaque progression, \nlevels of SPMs and pro-inflammatory mediators \nwere measured using liquid chromatography-tandem \nmass spectrometry in 31 statin-treated patients with \nstable coronary artery disease randomized to EPA \nand DHA, 3.36 g daily, or no EPA/DHA (control) \nfor 30 months. Higher plasma levels of EPA + DHA \nwere associated with significantly increased levels of \ntwo SPMs-resolvin E1 and maresin 1-hydroxy and \n18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE), the pre-\ncursor of resolvin E1. Those with a median (interquar -\ntile range) \u03a9-3 fatty acid index of 8.4% (8.1\u20139.6) fell \ninto two groups: the majority had plaque regression \nwhereas a few had plaque progression. Those with \nplaque progression had a low ratio of (18-HEPE + \nresolvin E1) to LTB4, a pro-inflammatory mediator. \nThose with plaque regression had a high ratio of (18-\nHEPE + resolvin E1) to LTB4. These findings suggest \nSystematic Review\nCritical Care Explorations  www.ccejournal.org     5that the balance between pro-resolving and pro-\ninflammatory lipid mediators determines the change \nin coronary plaque and is a better measure of inflam-\nmation than CRP in this context.\nCLINICAL EVIDENCE OF POTENTIAL \nACUTE CARE EFFICACY OF \u03a9-3 FATTY \nACIDS FOR AF\nThe \u03a9-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) decrease the mag-\nnitude of the electrical currents elicited by the acti-\nvation of calcium (and sodium) channels. Class VII \nantiarrhythmic drugs stabilize both electrophysiolog-\nical and structural remodeling that occurs, and there-\nfore the extent of fibrotic changes in cardiac tissues in \nresponse to acute MI or following cardiac surgery, as \nthe heart heals from an acute cardiac event. It is likely \nthat the principal mechanism(s) of short-term preven-\ntion of AF is perhaps electrophysiologic or reduction \nin inflammation may be different than the one(s) re-\nsponsive for chronic prevention.\nOf the for drugs listed in class VII, \u03a9-3 fatty acids \nand statins uniquely reduce myocardial damage, risks \nof stroke and cardiac death, as well as abnormal cardiac \nrhythms. It is important to remember that class VII agents as described (1) are clinically applied to address \nlong-term pathological changes from unrestrained or \npathological cardiac remodeling. In this setting, \u03a9-3 \nfatty acids could be prescribed via daily oral supple-\nmentation. In the acute care setting; however, drug \ntherapy requires prompt delivery of \u03a9-3 fatty acids \n(pharmacokinetics) and effect (pharmacodynamics), \nwith the administration of the active pharmaceutical \ningredient (API) (e.g., statins or \u03a9-3 fatty acids), and \nthis is most often accomplished IV . Is there any clinical \nevidence of efficacy against POAF in patients under -\ngoing CABG surgery with either agent by parenteral \nadministration? As for statin therapy, there is no com-\nmercially available IV dosage form; hence we refer to \nthe alternative, that is, the use of IV fish oil-in-water \nemulsions containing \u03a9-3 fatty acids in this setting.\nThere are six main studies (46\u201351) where IV fish \noil emulsion (FOE) has been administered in patients \nundergoing CABG surgery and a summary of these \ninvestigations is provided in Table 2 .\nThe summary only includes studies where \u03a9-3 fatty \nacids were given IV , and a number of inconsistencies \nare apparent. A total of 167 patients undergoing CABG \nsurgery received IV \u03a9-3 fatty acids as intervention \ntherapy. Of the three studies that provided several days \nTABLE 2.\nClinical Studies of Fish Oil Emulsion in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Patients\nReference FOE/Total Patients Comments \nHeidt et al \n(46)52/102 n = 52 for FOE group (0.03 g/kg/d of EPA + DHA), and n = 50 for SO emulsion \ngroup; regimen started on admission and ended upon discharge; primary \nendpoint: POAF; 17 .3% in FOE vs 30.6% in SO, p < 0.05\nVeljovic et al \n(47)20/40 n = 20 for FOE group (3 g of EPA + DHA) and n = 20 for saline (NS) group; a \nsingle preoperative dose; FOE promoted \u201cmetabolic recovery\u201d\nBerger et al \n(48)14/28 n = 14 for FOE group (0.066 g/kg/d of EPA + DHA, one preoperative dose, and \ntwo postoperative doses) and n = 14 for NS group; significant \u2191 uptake in \nplatelet and atrial tissue membranes\nLomivorotov \net al (49)18/39 n = 18 for FOE group (0.066 g/kg of EPA + DHA preoperative dose, and \n0.033 g/kg/d \u00d7 7 d) and n = 21 for placebo; POAF; 27 .8% in FO vs 19% in \nplacebo, p = 0.88\nKolesnikov  \net al (50)33/73 n = 33 for FOE group (3 g/d of EPA + DHA 5\u20137 d postoperative) and n = 40 for \ncontrol; POAF; 9.1% in FOE vs 32.5% in placebo, p < 0.01\nFeguri et al \n(51)30/60 n = 30 for 2 FOE groups dosed at 0.2 g/kg/hr intraoperatively for 4 hr; no serum \ntriglyceride data; FOE appears to support faster postoperative recovery in \ncoronary artery bypass grafting surgery\nN 167/342  \nEPA = eicosapentaenoic acid, FOE = fish oil emulsion, DHA = docosahexaenoic acid, POAF = postoperative atrial fibrillation, SO = \nsoybean oil.\nDriscoll et al\n6     www.ccejournal.org September 2023 \u2022 Volume 5 \u2022 Number 10of infusion (46, 49, 50), two studies showed a signif-\nicant reduction in POAF in CABG patients (46, 50), \nwhereas the other (49) showed no such difference. Of \nthe remaining three studies, FOEs were given either \nas a single preoperative dose (47) or one preoperative \ndose followed by two postoperative doses (48), but the \noutcome parameters were mainly metabolic-related. In \nthe final study (51), IV infusion of FOE was uniquely \ngiven intraoperatively, and the suggested benefit was \n\u201cfaster recovery. \u201d All of the studies were very small and \nemployed different dosages and treatment regimens \nfor the FOE infusions and outcomes, so there were \nlikely significant confounding variables.\nPOTENTIAL EFFICACY OF A REFINED \nAND ENRICHED FISH OIL PRODUCT\nThe FOE product given IV in all of the aforementioned \nstudies was based on a single-source, FDA-approved \ncommercially available injectable dosage form consist-\ning of fish oil triglycerides, which is indicated as a nu-\ntritional supplement, that is, \u201cas a source of calories and \nfatty acids\u201d (52), not as a drug. It is a natural, refined \nfish oil that complies with the European Monograph \nor EP 1912 (53), but the \u03a9-3 fatty acid profile can be \nhighly variable. The product information from the FOE \npackage insert states the following ranges per 10 g of  \nfish oil: EPA mean: 2.0 g, range: 1.2 g (\u00b1 40%)\u20133.0 g (\u00b1 \n50%), DHA mean: 1.9 g, range: 1.3 (\u00b1 32%)\u20133.3 g (\u00b1 \n74%). Indications for API or drugs require very spe-\ncific therapeutic limits, and a typical United States \nPharmacopeia (USP) monograph requires the drug \nconcentration to be \u00b1 10% of the labeled amount. \nFor example, if the EPA + DHA content is labeled at \n100 mg/mL, the acceptable API concentration range \nover its shelf life would be 90\u2013110 mg/mL. In contrast, \nand according to the manufacturer (54), the FOE nu-\ntritional product contains approximately 30 mg/mL \nof EPA + DHA. If used as a drug, the USP specifica-\ntion range should be 27\u201333 mg/mL. Consequently, the \naforementioned studies in Table\u00a0 2 were conducted \nwith a nutritional supplement whose concentrations \nof EPA + DHA are highly variable and therefore may \nexplain the equivocal results observed. Using the same \nnutritional product in patients with severe COVID-19 \ninfection, a small study (22 patients) using inflamma-\ntory markers as endpoints was reported in a Letter to \nthe Editor (55), showing a significant, but transitory reduction in CRP at 48 hours, but not at the end of the \nstudy (5 d). This may also be a reflection of the vari-\nable concentrations of \u03a9-3 fatty acids in the nutritional \nproduct (56).\nOf note, the study by Berger et al (48) gave 0.2 g/kg \nover 2 hours for each of the three doses (two preoper -\natively, one postoperatively) that produced transient, \nbut significant, hypertriglyceridemia. The study by \nFeguri et al (51) gave the same dose, only once intra-\noperatively, over 4 hours, but serum triglycerides were \nnot measured. The mixed results from these studies \nwere also likely affected by the variability in the de-\nlivery of consistent amounts of the proposed API (EPA \n+ DHA) per batch using the same nutritional product \nas described above.\nSAFE DOSING AND EFFICACIOUS \nDELIVERY OF PARENTERAL \u03a9-3 FATTY \nACIDS\nIn most fish oil triglyceride products (e.g., capsules, \ninjection), the usual ratio of EPA to DHA is ~1.5:1, \nwhether it is a natural refined fish oil that complies \nwith EP 1912 (53), or one that is both refined and \nsynthetically enriched (57), complying with EP 1352 \n(58). What differs between these two monographs is \nthe concentration of EPA and DHA, and that depends \nupon the pharmaceutical quality based on the com-\nmercial production processes, that is, one oil that is re-\nfined without changing the EPA:DHA concentrations \nversus the other that is both refined and enriched, that \nessentially doubles the concentrations of each in a \nfixed ratio (59). Moreover, as mentioned, the effective \nantiarrhythmic dose of \u03a9-3 fatty acids can only be de-\ntermined if the amount of the API varies no more than \n\u00b1 10% of the labeled amount.\nFor the most part, EPA and DHA are the most \nabundant of the available \u03a9-3 fatty acids in fish oil \ntriglycerides which have pharmacological effects. \nAlso, the specific dose will need to be optimized to \nachieve the desired antiarrhythmic response, as rou-\ntinely performed for several other critical care drugs. \nImportantly, the maximum infusion rate for safety \npurposes of the typical long-chain fatty acids derived \nfrom soybean oil-based triglycerides (mainly con-\nsisting of 18 carbons such as linoleic acid, oleic acid, \n\u03b1-linolenic acid, and stearic acid), is set at 0.11 g/kg/\nhour (60). For fish oil triglycerides enriched in \u03a9-3 \nSystematic Review\nCritical Care Explorations  www.ccejournal.org     7fatty acids, the infusion should be cautiously started \nat a lower rate, since these very long-chain fatty acids \n(\u2265 20 carbons such as EPA and DHA) are even more \nslowly cleared from plasma with implications for \nhypertriglyceridemia causing severe fat overload syn-\ndrome (61).\nThe main concern is that the rate of the lipid emul-\nsion infusion does not exceed its metabolic utilization \nrate (48), which can lead to complications related to \nfat overload, such as severe hypertriglyceridemia, dep-\nosition of fat in vital organs causing reticuloendothe-\nlial system dysfunction and pulmonary gas diffusion \nabnormalities in ventilated patients (62). The suggested \npharmacological dose range for IV infusion of EPA + \nDHA in the critical care setting is between 4 and 6 g/\nday (63). Applying a weight-based regimen, consistent \nwith a typical BMI range of 25\u201329 (\u201coverweight\u201d) for \npatients undergoing CABG surgery via continuous in-\nfusion is presented in Table 3 . Theoretically, since the \ntherapeutically effective dose is not known and since \nfat toxicity is a known outcome if the infusion rate \nexceeds the metabolic rate, the FOE should be admin-\nistered over 24 hours. However, this infusion reg-\nimen is wholly predicated upon the clinical response. \nTherefore, the ideal dose and infusion time should \nbe carefully titrated, monitored, and correlated with \na favorable therapeutic response. It should begin as a \n\u201cstarter\u201d dose preoperatively (e.g., one-fourth of the \ndaily dose over 6 hr), followed by a continuous IV dose \nover 24 hours that may be optimal. Finally, administer -\ning the enriched fish oil triglycerides by continuous IV \ninfusion may afford maximal cardioprotection during \nthe acute postoperative period. These issues should be \ndetermined in a formal clinical study.CONCLUSIONS\n\u03a9-3 fatty acids exert both electrophysiological and \nstructural effects on the heart that ultimately re-\nduce the negative impact resulting from \u201cacceler -\nated\u201d remodeling changes, which may otherwise lead \nto clinically significant conduction disturbances. \nAlthough their efficacy as a class VII antiarrhyth-\nmic agent is related to pathological remodeling in \nthe long-term setting, they may also be beneficial in \nprotecting the heart from developing AF in the acute \ncare, postoperative setting following CABG surgery \nby inducing favorable electrophysiologic effects, \nand/or downregulating the inflammatory response \nby modifying eicosanoid production and enhancing \nhealing mediated by SPMs as metabolites of eicosa-\npentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. The \u03a9-3 fatty \nacids (and their downstream mediators) produce \nseveral \u201cpharmacologic-like\u201d actions upon the cardi-\novascular system, making them potentially multitar -\ngeted API.\n 1  Stable Solutions LLC, Easton MA.\n 2  Department of Medicine, UMASS Chan Medical School, \nWorcester, MA.\n 3  Department of Cardiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, \nMA.\n 4  Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.\nDr. Driscoll is inventor of U.S. Patent No. US 8,241,672 entitled \n\u201cOmega-3 enriched fish oil-in-water parenteral nutrition emul-\nsions,\u201d filed on March 11, 2009.
