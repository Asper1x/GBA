Despite a long history of use and numerous \nclinical trials, the human pharmacokinetics of withanolides, the active phytochemicals in WS \nextracts, have not been fully evaluated. This study evaluated the oral pharmacokinetics and \nbioequivalence of active withanolides in human plasma after administration of a single dose of \ntwo commercial ashwagandha extracts containing equal amounts of total withanolides. \nMethods: This randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover study of 16 healthy human vol-\nunteers evaluated the acute oral bioavailability of withanolides and the bioequivalence of two WS \nextracts, WS-35 and WS-2.5. WS-35 was standardized to total withanolides not less than 40% \ncomprising not less than 35% withanolide glycosides and WS-2.5 was standardized to 2.5% \nwithanolides. The clinical dosages were normalized to 185 mg of total withanolide in each extract \nat the bioequivalent dosages. The pharmacokinetic parameters of withanolide A, withanoside IV, \nwithaferin A, and total withanolides were quantified in the blood plasma using a validated LC- \nMS/MS method. \nResults: The half-life, C-max, and mean residence time of the total withanolides were 5.18, 5.62 \nand 4.13 times significantly higher and had lower systemic clearance with WS-35 than with WS- \n2.5 extract. Considering the plasma AUC 0-inf of total withanolides per mg of each WS extract \nadministered orally, WS-35 was 280.74 times more bioavailable than WS-2.5. \nConclusion: The results of this study highlight the importance of withanolide glycosides in \nimproving the pharmacokinetics of WS extracts. Owing to its superior pharmacokinetic profile, \nWS-35, with 35% withanolide glycosides, is a promising candidate for further studies on Withania \nsomnifera. \nClinical trial registration: CTRI/2020/10/028397 [registered on:13/10/2020] (Trial prospectively \nregistered) http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?trialid \u008842149&EncHid\u0088&userName \n\u0088CTRI/2020/10/028397 .  \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail addresses: sknkim@pknu.ac.kr (S.-K.

Dunal (WS), known as \u2018ashwagandha \u2019 in Ayurveda, is a perennial shrub belonging to the Solanaceae family. \nIt is considered as one of the most important \u201cRasayana \u201d herbs, with powerful adaptogenic and anti-stress properties. The herb is \nknown to have a beneficial effect on the strength and function of the brain and nervous system while also enhancing sexual perfor -\nmance and reproductive function for a healthy life. As a powerful adaptogen, it enhances resilience to stress. In addition to its anti- \nstress and reproductive benefits, Ashwagandha is known to promote overall health and well-being. For instance, it is believed to \nhave a positive impact on sleep, helping improve sleep quality and duration. Additionally, Ashwagandha has been found to have \nimmunomodulatory properties, which means that it helps regulate the immune system and enhances its function. This makes ash-\nwagandha a useful herb for supporting overall immune health and for combating illnesses [1,2]. \nWS contains various pharmacologically important constituents in its roots, leaves, fruit, and stems. Withanolides in WS, comprising \nsteroidal lactones and withanosides, [3,4] are the active constituents responsible for several pharmacological activities [5]. Several \nwithanolides, including withaferin A, withanolide A, withanoside IV, sitoindosides, and alkaloids have been identified and isolated \nfrom WS. These compounds are mainly localized in mature leaves and roots. The identified molecules included 62 major and minor \nprimary and secondary metabolites from leaves and 48 metabolites from roots [6]. \nAshwagandha extracts are in high demand because of their adaptogenic and immunomodulatory properties. The ability of ash-\nwagandha to modulate the hypothalamus-pituitary axis and brain neurotransmitters has resulted in clinical findings related to \nreducing stress and anxiety, improving mood, and improving sleep quality. Withanolides also possess anti-inflammatory, immuno -\nmodulatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, antioxidant, aphrodisiac, antibacterial, and anti-neurodegenerative properties. Among the \nvarious ashwagandha extracts available on the market, the standardization of actives, analytical methodologies, plant parts used, \nmanufacturing methods, and recommended dosages vary considerably. These variables can potentially impact absorption charac -\nteristics and related therapeutic efficacy. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies on the bioactive constituents of herbal drugs provide valuable \ninformation on their metabolism, dosage form, and directions for clinical use [7]. However, limited human data are available on the \nbioavailability and metabolism of withanolide. \nThis study evaluated the oral pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of active withanolides in human plasma after administration of \na single dose of two commercial ashwagandha extracts containing equal amounts of total withanolides. In the present study, the \nbioanalytical method used to determine withanolide levels in human blood plasma was validated according to the USFDA guidelines \nand was successfully applied to determine pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy volunteers. This study aimed to investigate the \nrelationship between the ashwagandha extract and its oral bioavailability. \n2.Methods \n2.1. Study design \nThis bioavailability and bioequivalence single-center study employed a double-blind, balanced, randomized, single-dose crossover \ndesign. The study was conducted in healthy, adult human subjects under fasting conditionswith a minimum 7-day washout period \nbetween treatments to characterize the single-dose oral bioavailability and bioequivalence of two commercial ashwagandha extracts. \n2.2. Investigational products \nTwo commercial Withania somnifera extracts were selected to study their oral bioavailability and bioequivalence at a dose of 185 \nmg total withanolides. The investigational materials used were WS-35 (standardized to 35% withanolide glycosides) and WS-2.5 \n(standardized to 2.5% withanolides). \nExtract of dried roots and leaves of Withania somnifera WS-35 (Batch No. SH-PR 101 U/2003/S-16, Arjuna Natural Pvt. Ltd., India) \nwas standardized to total withanolides NLT 40% comprising NLT 35% withanolide glycosides by HPLC. Trace metals were analyzed \nand heavy metals D10 ppm, Lead D0.5 ppm, Arsenic D1 ppm, Cadmium D1 ppm and Mercury D1 ppm. Microbial assay was done \nand total platelet count D1000 cfu/g, Yeast and Mould D100 cfu/g, Salmonella Absent/25 g, E. coli Absent/10 g. Withania somnifera \nextract WS-2.5 (Batch No.: NBT/2001RM71, Natura Biotechnol, India) was standardized to withanolides NLT 2.5% by HPLC. Total \nheavy metals were NMT 10 ppm, Arsenic NMT 1 ppm, Cadmium NMT 1 ppm, Lead NMT 3 ppm and Mercury 0.1 ppm. Microbiological \nand pathogen analysis was done and Standard Plate count D10000 cfu/gm, Yeast and Mould D100 cfu/gm and pathogens like \nEscherichia coli, Salmonella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were absent. \nThe choice of these two formulations was based on the highest strength enriched ashwagandha extract available and a low-strength \nashwagandha with withanolide content. Dosage was formulated based on product specifications and 480 mg of WS-35 and 7400 mg of \nWS-2.5 provided an equal amount of 185 mg total withanolides. The investigational products were encapsulated in opaque green \ncolored \u20180\u2019 size capsules. All capsules had the same color, appearance, and packaging, and rice powder was used to achieve a consistent \nfilling weight. S.-K.

Ethical approval \nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Sai Sneh Hospital and Diagnostic Center, Pune (DCGI \nReg. No: ECR/989/Inst/MH/2017) before the commencement of the study. The study was conducted at Synergen Bio Private Limited, \nPune, in November\u2013December 2020 and the study participants were recruited from their database in accordance with the EC-approved \nprotocol (No. 006-20, Date of Approval September 29, 2020) and clinical research guidelines established by the basic principles \ndefined in the ICH-GCP guidelines (2016), the ICMR Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects (2017), the \nDeclaration of Helsinki (Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013), G.S.R. 227(E) New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, and Guidelines for \nBioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies, Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, March 2005. This clinical trial was regis-\ntered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2020/10/028397; registered on: 13/10/2020). \n2.4. Participant screening and informed consent \nParticipants were screened within 21 days before dosing after obtaining their informed consent. The principal investigator, using \nEnglish and/or Marathi as per the participants\u2019 preference, provided a detailed oral presentation on the study\u2019s purpose, procedures, \ninvestigational products, potential risks, study requirements, and participant rights. Participants had the opportunity to ask questions \nand resolve any concerns. The interested participants signified their willingness to participate in the study by reading, signing and \ndating the consent document. These signed documents were securely filed in the study records and a copy was provided to the \nparticipant. \n2.5. Selection of study participants \nThe participants, who were eligible when assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, were selected for the \nstudy. \n2.5.1. Inclusion criteria \nEligible participants included healthy male and non-pregnant, non-lactating female subjects aged between 18 and 45 years. Female \nsubjects of childbearing potential were required to have recent negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-HCG) and urine \npregnancy tests, alongside the use of approved contraceptive methods. Acceptable forms of contraception included non-hormonal \nintrauterine devices, barrier methods with or without a spermicidal agent, surgical sterilization, or sexual abstinence. Male partici -\npants were required to agree to the use of appropriate contraceptive measures and refrain from sperm donation during the study \nperiod. Participants should have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.50 and 30.00 kg/m2, and a body mass not less than 50.00 kg. \nThey should be in normal health based on personal medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory test results. Participants were \nalso required to have a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, a normal chest X-Ray (P/A view), and a negative alcohol \nbreath test result. Effective communication skills, written informed consent, adherence to the study\u2019s protocol, provision of identity \nevidence, availability for the entire study duration, and the ability to fast for at least 14.00 h were also necessary for inclusion. \n2.5.2. Exclusion criteria \nThe exclusion criteria included participants with known hypersensitivity to ashwagandha or related drugs, individuals incapable of \nunderstanding the informed consent information, or those with a history or presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, \nrenal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunological, dermatological, neurological, or psychiatric disease. Additionally, participants with \na history or presence of alcoholism, drug abuse, or certain medical conditions such as asthma, gastric and/or duodenal ulceration, \nthyroid disease, adrenal dysfunction, organic intracranial lesion, or cancer were also excluded. Furthermore, individuals who had \nconsumed certain substances such as tobacco, pan masala, gutkha, caffeine, or xanthine-containing foods within 48.00 h prior to the \nstudy were not included. Pregnant or nursing women, as well as those who had used implanted or injected hormonal contraceptives \nwithin 6 months prior to the study, were also excluded. Male volunteers unwilling to employ appropriate contraceptive measures or \nthose willing to donate sperm during and up to 07 days after the completion of study were not included. \n2.6. Sample size calculation \nNCSS PASS was used for the sample size analysis process. The minimum number of participants needed for this study to detect a \nstatistically significant effect size at a specific level of significance was calculated using a power analysis. Different factors like power \n(1-beta), significance level, and expected effect size were considered during the sample size analysis. An effect size with a 95% \nconfidence level specified in the analysis, based on prior research served as the foundation for the sample size analysis. In order to \nconfirm that the study would have sufficient sample power to detect significant relationships and differences among observations at \nlittle types I and II errors, sample size and power assessments were conducted. The minimum sample size needed to have a power of \n90% at a significance level of 5% with an effect size 0.6 is 12. With an estimated drop out of 20%, a total number of 16 subjects was \nrequired for the study. S.-K. Kim et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nHeliyon 9 (2023) e22843\n42.7. Randomization, blinding and dispensing of investigational products \nA total of 16 individuals were selected for this study, each assigned a unique number from 01 to 16. Group assignments during the \ncrossover period were determined using a randomization schedule generated by a biostatistician using the PROC PLAN procedure of \nSAS (SAS Institute Inc., U.S.A.) version 9. The investigational products were dispensed by the pharmacy custodian in coded bottles, \nfollowing the randomization schedule while maintaining blinding. Dispensing records were securely stored in the pharmacy with \ncontrolled access throughout the study. Before dosing, a randomization code break envelope was prepared by the pharmacist, indi-\ncating the subject number, period number, and protocol number. This study was conducted as a double-blind trial, ensuring that both \nsubjects and investigators remained unaware of the treatment received to prevent bias. The test and reference formulation closely \nresembled each other in color and appearance, facilitating blinding. \n2.8. Study procedure \nSubjects were accommodated in the clinical facility for a minimum of 11 h prior to dosing to ensure a fasting period of at least 10 h \nbefore the administration of the investigational product and for pre-dose blood sample collection. They remained in the facility post- \ndose until at least 24 h in each period. Following the administration of each product, there was a washout period of 7 days (equivalent \nto at least five elimination half-lives) to minimize the presence of measurable drug levels before dosing in the subsequent period. All \nsubjects were instructed to avoid caffeine and/or xanthine-containing foods or beverages (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate, caffeine- \ncontaining sodas) and grapefruit and/or its juice, as well as poppy-containing foods, for at least 48 h prior to check-in for each \nperiod and throughout their stay in the facility. Subjects received a standardized meal on the check-in day and the meal content and \nquantity were consistent for all periods. Drinking water was prohibited from 1 h before dosing until 1 h after dosing (except for \napproximately 240 mL of water provided during dosing) in each period. \n2.9. Collection and processing of plasma samples \nAfter an overnight fasting for a minimum of 10 h, WS-35 or WS-2.5 was orally administered according to the randomization \nschedule in each period. Blood samples were collected at various time points: pre-dose (0 h), as well as at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, \n3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 h post-dosing to measure the plasma concentrations of ashwagandha extract. Each period involved the \ncollection of a total of 17 blood samples per subject. Blood samples were obtained through an indwelling cannula placed in a forearm \nvein using disposable syringes. An intravenous indwelling cannula was kept in situ as long as possible during the 24-h in-house stay in \neach period. At each sampling time point, 5 mL of blood was collected into pre-labeled sample collection tubes containing lithium \nHeparin anticoagulant. Centrifugation of the blood samples, under refrigeration, commenced within 1 h of collection. After centri -\nfugation, the separated plasma was transferred to pre-labeled polypropylene tubes, with each tube indicating project number, subject \nnumber, period number and sampling time point. These polypropylene tubes were stored at \u000080 \u2022C \u00b110 \u2022C within 1 h of the \ncentrifugation process. The blinded plasma samples were later analyzed for actives of ashwagandha using a high-performance liquid \nchromatography (LC-MS-MS) method. \n2.10. Bioanalytical procedures \n2.10.1. Chemicals and reagents \nReference standards for withanoside IV (USP grade, Lot no:1719532), withaferin A (analytical standard, Lot no:89910), and \nwithanolide A (USP grade, Lot no:1719500) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The internal standard, Tia-\nneptine Cas No. 66981-73-5, was procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methanol, Acetonitrile, o-phosphoric acid, and \nformic acid (LCMS grade) were purchased from Merck, India and water was collected from a Milli-Q organic-free water system \n(Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). The OasisR HLB solid-phase extraction cartridge was obtained from Waters (Milford, MA). \n2.10.2. Instrumentation \nA Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with an Acquity H-class UPLC with a PDA detector (Waters Corporation, Milford, \nU.S.A) was used to analyze withanoside IV, withaferin A and withanolide A in the plasma samples. Tianeptine was used as the internal \nstandard [8]. Acquity UPLC BEH phenyl C18 column 100 \u00d72.1 mm L.D., 1.7 \u03bcm, (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was used. The gradient \nmobile phase was 0.1% formic acid and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The gradient program was 5% B, 7.20 min, 45% B, 10\u201311.2 \nTable 1 \nMass spectrometer parameters.  \nParameters Withanoside IV Withaferin A Withanolide A Tianeptine \nMolecular weight (Da) 782.9 470.6 470.6 458.933 \nParent mass (m/z) 827.4408 471.1711 471.185 437.0904 \nProduct mass (m/z) 763.3592 94.95 263.1045 292.0991 \nCollision energy (eV) 32 50 26 38 \nCone voltage (eV) 30 22 24 22  S.-K.

Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in the positive and negative ESI \nmultiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan type with negative ion mode for withanoside IV and positive ion mode for withaferin A, \nwithanolide A internal standard. The mass spectrometer parameters are listed in Table 1. \n2.10.3. Preparation and extraction of standards and samples \nStandard stock solutions of withanoside IV (1 mg/mL, w/v), withaferin A (1 mg/mL, w/v), withanolide A (1 mg/ml, w/v), and \ntianeptine (internal standard) (1 mg/mL, w/v) were prepared in methanol. The 50 \u03bcL of working solutions of standards were added to \n450 \u03bcL of blank plasma to obtain withanoside IV and withanolide A concentration levels of 1.00 \u2013640 ng/mL and withaferin A con-\ncentration levels of 0.50 \u2013320 ng/mL. The sample preparation involved solid-phase extraction with OasisR HLB 1cc cartridges. Cali-\nbration standards and QC samples were spiked with 25 \u03bcL internal standard (2.00 \u03bcg/mL) and diluted with 500 \u03bcL of 4% ortho \nphosphoric acid in Eppendorf tubes, and samples were loaded into the preconditioned SPE cartridge. The cartridges were then washed \nwith water (1 ml of water). Withanoside IV, withaferin A and withanolide A eluted with 3 \u00d71 ml of methanol. The solvent was then \nevaporated using a high-performance personal evaporation system (Genevac). The residue was reconstituted with 0.5 ml of aceto -\nnitrile: water containing 0.1% formic acid (1:1) and filtrate was injected into the LC-MS/MS system. \n2.10.4. Method validation \nThe method was validated in accordance with the industrial guidelines for bioanalytical method validation of the US Food and FDA \n[9]. Drug-free human plasma containing K2 EDTA anticoagulant was obtained from the blood bank and stored frozen at \u000080 \u00b110 \u2022C \nuntil analysis. The retention times of analytes in the interfering substances were absent from chromatograms obtained from six \ndifferent sources of blank plasma spiked with target analytes at the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) levels. Representative chro-\nmatograms are shown in Fig. 1(A\u2013C). The calibration curve regressions for withanoside IV, withanolide A and withaferin A exhibit \nstrong linearity with coefficients of determination (r2) of 0.9990, 0.9969, and 0.9985 respectively. The LLOQ was calculated by the \nFig. 1.Representative UPLC -ESI-MRM chromatograms of extracted blank human plasma (A) chromatogram of blank human plasma without in-\nternal standard (B) chromatogram of blank human plasma spiked with internal standard (C) chromatogram of blank human plasma spiked with \nwithaferin A, withanolide A and withanoside IV at lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) level.

The LLOQ of withanoside IV and withanolide A \nwas 1.0 ng/ml and that of withaferin A 0.5 ng/ml in plasma. The LOD for withanoside IV, withaferinA and withanolide A is 0.5, 0.5 & \n0.1 ng/ml. Intra/inter day precision and accuracy determined using QC samples at four concentrations with six replications spiked in \nthe blank plasma were found to be within acceptable range (\u00b120% & 80\u2013120% for LLOQ, D15% & 85\u2013115% for other QC\u2019s of nominal \nconcentration) (Table 2). The Intra batch precision (coefficient of variation) ranged from 6.95 to 17.98% for withanoside IV, \n7.27 \u201316.62% for withaferin A and 3.47 \u201315.85% for withanolide A respectively. The accuracy (%) ranged from 89.18 to 96.63% for \nwithanoside IV, 92.99 \u2013102.97% for withaferin A and 94.09 \u2013107.57% for withanolide A respectively. The Inter batch coefficients of \nvariation ranged from 1.61 to 10.76% for withanoside IV, 0.06 \u20136.77% for withaferin A and 1.46 \u20135.30% for withanolide A. The ac-\ncuracy ranged from 95.33 to 100.57% for withanoside IV, 93.05 \u2013100.21% for Withaferin A and 92.81 \u2013105.12% for withanolide A \nrespectively. The percentage extraction recoveries ranged from 93.06 to 93.60% for withanoside IV, 91.72 \u201393.54% for withaferin A \nand 91.23 \u201391.61% for withanolide A respectively (Table 3). The percentage of matrix effects ranged from 91.00 to 94.00% for \nwithanoside IV, 90.80 \u201394.04% for withaferin A and 90.88 \u201393.42% for Withanolide A respectively (Tables 2 and 3). Since the blood \nsamples were collected in K2 EDTA tubes, the impact of anticoagulants on quantification was also analyzed and found no interfere with \nthe assay performance. The stability of LQC, MQC & HQC with six replicate samples of withanoside IV, withaferin A and withanolide A \nwere assessed under conditions such as long term stability (\u000080 \u2022C for 60 days), three freeze (\u000020 \u2022C) thaw cycles (at room tem-\nperature), short-term room temperature storage and autosampler stability (Table 4). In all stability tests, the samples exhibited a \nrecovery rate of 90\u2013105%. These results confirm the stability of withanoside IV, withaferin A, and withanolide A under the specified \nconditions. \n2.11. Pharmacokinetic analysis \nPharmacokinetic end point and the pk variables were calculated using the \u2018ncappc \u2019 package in R [9]. The pharmacokinetic pa-\nrameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0- \u221e of actives of Ashwagandha Extracts were compared after log transformation. Other pharma -\ncokinetic parameters, Tmax, t1/2, Kel and extrapolated AUC of actives of ashwagandha extracts were obtained and reported. \nFig. 1. (continued ). S.-K. Kim et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nHeliyon 9 (2023) e22843\n72.12. Safety assessment \nSafety laboratory assessments were performed during the participant screening and at the end of the study. Adverse events were \nrecorded by spontaneous reporting and non-directive questioning of each participant during each visit.Physical examination, vital \nsigns, laboratory investigations, and ECG were performed during the clinical laboratory evaluation. \n2.13. Statistical evaluation \nThe present study was a single-dose study that included the calculation of the area under the curve to the last quantifiable con-\ncentration (AUC 0-t and AUC 0-\u221e), Tmax, and Cmax. Additionally, the elimination rate constant (Ke), elimination half-life (t1/2), and other \nparameters were estimated. Bioequivalence is generally determined by comparing the population averages of a bioequivalence metric, \nsuch as AUC and Cmax. This approach, termed average bioequivalence, involves the calculation of a 90% confidence interval for the ratio \nof averages (population geometric means) of the bioequivalence metrics for the test and reference drug products [10]. Mean ratios and \n90% confidence intervals were calculated for PK variables. \nA 2 \u00d72 crossover design using t-test was conducted on the data using NCSS 2021 to determine the bioequivalence as well as to \nestimate the variability in the average response of the treatment and reference to the pharmacokinetic parameters at a significant level \nof 0.05. A 2 \u00d72 crossover design using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U Test was used to determine the variability in Tmax between \nthe treatments. The Fieller \u2019s confidence interval test was used to check the bioequivalence of the pharmacokinetic parameters, except \nfor Tmax. The confidence interval approach, originally proposed by Westlake (1981) [11], suggests that bioequivalence can be \ndetermined if a (1 \u00002\u03b1) \u00d7100% confidence interval for the difference \u03bc\u03bcTT \u0000\u03bc\u03bcRR or ratio \u03bc\u03bcTT/\u03bc\u03bcRR falls within predefined \nacceptance limits. The Tmax was estimated as the sampling time point at which Cmax occurred. Its distribution, either on the original \nor the log scale, rarely follows a normal distribution. As a result, both the EMEA guidance (2001) and the WHO draft guidelines (2005) \nrecommend using a 90% non-parametric confidence interval for assessment of average bioequivalence based on Tmax [12]. \nNon-parametric Schuirmann \u2019s Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Equivalence Test using Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) was performed to \nFig. 1. (continued ). S.-K. Kim et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nHeliyon 9 (2023) e22843\n8determine the Tmax. A paired t-test analysis was conducted on safety test parameters (haemoglobin, RBC, PCV, WBC count, neu-\ntrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, platelet count, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, blood urea \nand creatinine) to understand any significant variability between the observations during screening and post-test period. \n3.Results \nSixteen healthy participants were enrolled in the study to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the ashwagandha extract. One \nsubject dropped out during the second visit, 15 subjects completed the crossover study. The data of 15 subjects who completed the \ncross over study were analyzed.

The average bioequivalence of the two products was found to be at a significance level of 0.05, \nand both confidence limits were outside the acceptance limits of 80 and 120. The Fieller \u2019s confidence interval test and Schuirmann \u2019s \nWilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Equivalence test of pharmacokinetic parameters showed no statistically significant bioequivalence between \nWS-35 and WS-2.5 at \u03b1 \u00880.05 (Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S2). \nThe investigational products were found to be safe and well tolerated by the administration of a single dose of ashwagandha extract \nin healthy adult male subjects under fasting conditions. There was no significant variability in the safety parameters (p F0.05) during \nthe treatment (Supplementary Table S3). No severe, serious, or life-threatening adverse events were reported during the course of the \nstudy. \n4.Discussion \nWithania somnifera of the Solanaceae family is the best-known plant that produces a group of secondary metabolites, known as \nwithanolides. The general structure of withanolides is C28 ergostane with a side chain that forms a \u03b4-lactone ring between C22 and \nC26. Based on their steroidal backbones, withanolides share an upstream biosynthetic pathway with phytosterols [13]. \nBioavailability is defined as the fraction of the administered dose of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation [14]. In other \nwords, bioavailability is the extent and rate at which the active ingredient or moiety in the product is absorbed and becomes available \nat the site of action. The extent and rate of drug absorption are usually measured using the area under the blood or plasma \nconcentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax). The two products were considered pharmaceutical equivalents \nif they contained identical amounts of the same active ingredient. Two products are identified as pharmaceutical alternatives if they \ncontain an identical therapeutic moiety, but not necessarily in the same amount or dosage form, or as the same salt or ester. Two \nproducts are said to be bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutical equivalents (i.e., similar dosage forms made, perhaps by different \nmanufacturers) or pharmaceutical alternatives (i.e., different dosage forms). If their rates and extent of absorption do not show a \nsignificant difference, the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives become \navailable at the site of action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study. \nThe products considered in this study are neither pharmaceutical equivalents nor alternatives. To claim bioequivalence in average \nbioavailability for the untransformed data, the \u00b120 rule requires that the ratio of the two true formulation averages be within (80%, \n120%) limits. If the constructed confidence interval fell within the (80%, 120%) limits, then the two formulations were considered \nbioequivalent; otherwise, they were not bioequivalent. In our study, all the constructed 90% confidence intervals for the pharma -\ncokinetic parameters of withanolide A, withaferin A, withanoside IV were outside the theoretical range, and both products were \nproved to be not bioequivalent. \nSeveral factors affect the rate and extent of bioavailability following oral administration. In this study, ashwagandha extracts \nenriched with withanolide glycosides were compared with regular ashwagandha extracts standardized to contain equal amounts of \ntotal withanolides. Behl et al. (2020) analyzed the plasma concentration of Withaferin A mice and suggested the low bioavailability of \nwithaferin A following oral administration of an aqueous solution of the crude extract [15,16]. The intestinal epithelium plays an \nimportant role in the absorption and transportation of medicinally active constituents of withanolides. Devkar et al. (2015) studied the \nintestinal permeability of withanolide constituents in Withania somnifera in an in vitro absorption model system using canine kidney \ncell culture, and reported the lowest permeability of Withaferin A whereas non-polar withanolides with low molecular weights, such as \nwithanolide A, were found to be the most permeable [16,17]. \nDespite the standardized test products for total withanolide content, the pharmacokinetic profile varied significantly between the \ntwo products. One reason for the variability in the PK profile may be bioconversion. Withanolide glycosides undergo biotransformation \nand can be converted to withaferin A, which in turn increases the plasma concentration of withaferin A. The study results highlight the \nuniqueness of the composition of ashwagandha extract, as WS-35 is significantly richer in withanolide glycosides than WS-2.5. CYP450 \nenzymes in humans are involved in the metabolism of majority of drugs, with approximately 50% through CYP3A4 and 25% by Table 8 \nComparison of pharmacokinetic parameters of total withanolides concentration in blood plasma with Withania somnifera extracts.  \nParameters WS-35 WS-2.5 LSM Difference \u00b1SE 95% CI P value \nLSM \u00b1SE LSM \u00b1SE Lower Upper \nAUC 0-inf* 815.036 \u00b122.591 44.757 \u00b10.573 770.278 \u00b122.73 721.173 819.383 D0.001 \nAUC 0-t* 662.568 \u00b118.176 37.833 \u00b10.504 624.735 \u00b118.107 585.618 663.852 D0.001 \nAUC ext* 152.468 \u00b112.267 6.925 \u00b10.162 145.543 \u00b112.299 118.973 172.113 D0.001 \nClearance * 0.23 \u00b10.007 4.144 \u00b10.054 \u00003.914 \u00b10.056 \u00004.035 \u00003.793 D0.001 \nCmax * 60.66 \u00b11.086 10.789 \u00b10.128 49.871 \u00b11.128 47.433 52.308 D0.001 \nKe* 0.073 \u00b10.003 0.369 \u00b10.006 \u00000.296 \u00b10.005 \u00000.307 \u00000.285 D0.001 \nLambda Z* 0.073 \u00b10.003 0.369 \u00b10.006 \u00000.296 \u00b10.005 \u00000.307 \u00000.285 D0.001 \nMean Residence Time * 14.458 \u00b10.565 3.503 \u00b10.028 10.955 \u00b10.559 9.747 12.162 D0.001 \nt half* 9.756 \u00b10.517 1.882 \u00b10.03 7.874 \u00b10.509 6.775 8.972 D0.001 \nt max# 2.277 \u00b10.09 1.5 \u00b10 0.777 \u00b10.09 0.581 0.972 D0.001 \nVz* 3.207 \u00b10.155 11.257 \u00b10.244 \u00008.051 \u00b10.204 \u00008.491 \u00007.611 D0.001  \n*2 \u00d72 cross-over design using t-test. \n#2 \u00d72 cross-over design using Mann-Whitney test. S.-K. Kim et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nHeliyon 9 (2023) e22843\n13CYP2D6 [18]. Therefore, it is possible that the drug accumulates to a toxic level due to the inhibition of CYP enzymes or rapid excretion \ndue to the activation of CYP microsomal enzymes. Here, withanosides and withanolides acted as substrates for the CYP450 3A4 \nenzyme and non-substrates for CYP450 2C9 and CYP450 2D6 enzymes [19]. In the present study, withaferin A had the maximum oral \nbioavailability in systemic circulation. This may be due to the presence of withanolides, which regulate the hepatic metabolism of \nwithaferin A and its biliary excretion. \nSingh et al. [20] tested the bioavailability of withaferin A (purity 99%) by oral (25 mg/kg) and withanoside IV (2 mg/kg) routes in \nSprague Dawley rats and found its oral bioavailability to be poor (approximately 5%) despite rapid distribution after i. v. adminis -\ntration. The distribution of a drug in the body is largely driven by its physicochemical properties, and partly by the contribution of \ntransporter proteins [21]. The results of a phase I dose escalation study by Pires et al. [22] in 13 subjects did not detect withaferin A \neven at the highest dose tested. In this study, Withaferin A detected in the blood plasma of both ashwagandha extracts. One of the \nreasons for this difference could be attributed to the HPLC method by Pires et al. [22] which had a low specificity and sensitivity of 50 \nng/ml, whereas our developed and validated LC-MS/MS method had an improved limit of quantification with an LLOQ of 1.0 ng/ml \nfor withanoside IV and withanolide A and 0.5 ng/ml for withaferin A in plasma. \nThe area under the plasma level\u2013time curve (AUC) is a measure of drug bioavailability. The AUC reflects the total amount of active \ndrugs that reach systemic circulation. The AUC for total withanolides was the highest for WS-35, which was significantly higher than \nthat for WS-2.5. The significantly high AUC for WS-35 was attributed to the high levels of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and \nlonger T half of WS-35 compared to other test products. The significantly higher T-half of WS-35 compared to WS-2.5 indicates that \nWS-35, with its longer retention in the body, necessitates a lower dosage than WS-2.5. Such adjustment in dosage and are inevitable in \noptimizing the drug\u2019s efficacy profile [23]. The Cmax and Tmax results indicated that withanosides, withaferin A, and withanolide A \nwere rapidly absorbed by WS-35 compared to WS-2.5. The variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters may be attributed to dif-\nferences in the concentration of withanolide glycosides between WS-35 and WS-2.5, as well as metabolic bioconversions, as with-\nanolide glycosides undergo conversion into aglycones. The significant variation in T-max in the study reflect a complex interplay of \nseveral factors intrinsic to the study, such as individual sample characteristics, genetic diversities, and other unique variables specific \nto the samples under investigation. All of these factors collectively contribute to the observed variability in the time it takes for the drug \nto reach its peak concentration following drug administration. T-max can be influenced by a multitude of elements. Firstly, individual \nsample characteristics encompass a wide spectrum of variables, including but not limited to age, gender, weight, and underlying health \nconditions. These variables can affect how the body metabolizes and distributes the drug, ultimately influencing the time it takes to \nachieve peak concentration. Variations in genes responsible for drug metabolism and transport can lead to differences in the rate at \nwhich the drug is processed by the body, potentially affecting T-max [24]. \nA vast array of phytochemicals has been identified in ashwagandha. The Ashwgandha products available in the market were \nstandardized using different analytical methods. USP-35-NF 30 [25] is generally accepted as a uniform analytical method but measures \nonly withanoside IV, Physagulin D, 27-hydroxywithanone, withanoside V, withanoside VI, withaferin A, withastramonolide, with-\nanolide A, withanone, and withanolide B in ashwagandha. Another validated and developed reverse-phase HPLC method provided \nprecise differentiation and determination of withanolides and total withanolide glycosides present in the ashwagandha extract [26]. \nSuch a robust and validated analytical method that measures various withanolides in ashwagandha would be helpful for standardizing \nashwagandha extracts. \nThe toxicological assessment of WS-35 as conducted by Antony et al., in 2018 [27] has significantly contributed to establishing its \nsafety profile. The acute oral toxicity study in rats unequivocally demonstrated the acute safety of WS-35 at dosages of up to 2000 \nmg/kg body weight, with an LD50 value exceeding 2000 mg/kg body weight, highlighting the remarkably high level of safety \nassociated with WS-35. Furthermore, a 90-day repeated dose toxicity study in rats provided further evidence of the absence of toxic \neffects, as WS-35 was administered at a dosage level of 1000 mg/kg body weight. Notably, no observable toxic effects were discerned \nwhen compared to the control group, and both biochemical and hematological parameters remained within normal ranges throughout \nthe study. Additionally, histopathological examinations of major organs revealed no abnormalities, reaffirming the safety of WS-35 for \npotential therapeutic applications. \n4.1. Strength and limitations of the study \nIn this research study, a meticulously validated LC-MS-MS technique was utilized to precisely quantify the concentrations of three \ndistinct withanolides: withaferin A, withanolide A, and withanoside IV in blood plasma. Remarkably, the concentrations of these \ncompounds detected in the plasma samples fell well within the established validated range, underscoring a significant strength of this \nstudy. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of withaferin A is 0.5 ng/ml, withanoside IV is 1 ng/ml and withanolide A is 1 ng/ml \nwhich shows that the sensitivity of the validated method is high. \nOne of the limitations of this study is that it focused solely on withanolides in plasma and did not account for their extensive in-vivo \nmetabolism or the presence of secondary metabolites in urine or feces. Additionally, only three components: withanolide A, with-\nanoside IV, and withaferin A was quantified in plasma samples. Furthermore, the study\u2019s sample size was relatively small. Future \nresearch with a larger and more diverse sample size, encompassing a broader range of biological sexes and age groups, would enhance \nthe generalizability of the findings and further strengthen the study conclusions.

At the same dosage of total withanolides, the AUC 0-inf, \nCmax, MRT, and t-half of WS-35 were 18.21, 5.62, 4.13 and 5.18 times greater than those of the WS-2.5 extract. This study indi-\ncated that the strength of the extract (as measured by the withanolide content) is critical for its oral bioavailability, as measured by the \npharmacokinetic profile. The longer half-life and higher mean residence time of the higher strength extract WS-35, which contained \n35% withanolide glycosides, demonstrated its enhanced oral bioavailability. The results of this study also highlight the lack of bio-\nequivalence between the two WS extracts. \nEthics approval and consent to participate \nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Sai \nSneh Hospital and Diagnostic Center, Pune.
