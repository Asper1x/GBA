Mostafa 1, Gehad G. Mohamed 1,2 & Omar A. Fouad 1*\nLately, children\u2019s daily consumption of some products, such as cereals and candies, has been rising, \nwhich provides a compelling rationale for determining any metallic substances that may be present. \nMonitoring the concentration of certain metals, like nickel, in these products is necessary due to \nmedical issues in humans when consumed regularly. So, in this work, a novel and highly selective \ncarbon paste as a Ni(II) ion-selective sensor was prepared and investigated using ceramic magnesium \naluminum spinel nanoparticles as the ionophore and tritolyl phosphate (TOCP) as a plasticizer. A \nmodified co-precipitation method was used to synthesize the spinel nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction, \nscanning electron microscope with EDAX, transmission electron microscope, and BET surface area \nwere used to determine the phase composition, microstructure, pores size, particle size, and surface \narea of the synthesized nanoparticles. The spinel nanoparticle was found to have a nano crystallite size \nwith a cubic crystal system, a particle size ranging from 17.2 to 51.52 nm, mesoporous nature (average \npore size = 8.72 nm), and a large surface area (61.75  m2/g). The composition ratio of graphite carbon \nas a base: TOCP as binder: spinal as ionophore  was 67.3:30.0:2.7 (wt%) based on potentiometric \ndetections over concentrations from 5.0 \u00d7  10\u22128 to 1.0 \u00d7  10\u22122 mol  L\u22121 with LOD of 5.0 \u00d7  10\u22128 mol  L\u22121. \nA measurement of 29.22 \u00b1 0.12 mV  decade\u22121 over pH 2.0\u20137.0 was made for the Nernstian slope. \nThis sensor demonstrated good repeatability over nine weeks and a rapid response of 8 s. A good \nselectivity was shown for Ni(II) ions across many interferents, tri-, di-, and monovalent cations. The \nNi(II) content in spiked real samples, including cocaine, sweets, coca, chocolate, carbonated drinks, \ncereals, and packages, were measured. The results obtained indicated no significant difference \nbetween the proposed potentiometric method and the officially reported ICP method according to the \nF- and t-test data. In addition to utilizing ANOVA statistical analysis, validation procedures have been \nimplemented, and the results exceed the ICP-MS methodology.\nKeywords  Carbon paste electrode, Ceramic nanoparticles, Candy, Coca, Chocolate, Cocaine, Fizzy drinks, \nScanning electron microscope, X-ray, Potentiometry\nGlobally, metal pollution has garnered significant attention with the industry\u2019s rapid advancement. Since heavy \nmetals are very soluble, the body may effectively store them, and most of them are known to be very  harmful1. \nIndustrial agriculture is one potential source of heavy metals in products; industrial farm runoff can accumulate \nin soil or water and then be absorbed by cocoa beans through their root system when  growing2,3. Growing crops \nin the soil near volcanoes is also, consider as\u00a0another potential  source2\u20134.\nNickel is the fifth most common element on earth and is regarded as a fundamental minor component for \n humans5.\u00a0There are several oxidation states for nickel, but the (2+) oxidation state is the one that biosystems use \nthe  most6. Additionally, plants and some domestic animals are thought to require nickel, the metal component \nof the urease enzyme.

Furthermore, nickel ion contamination may be pre -\nsent in chocolate and other semi-finished compounds, including cocoa of liquor, butter, and powder, which can \nwithstand the post-harvest  process4.\nOrganization of World Health (WHO) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nhave established the maximum allowable concentration of nickel in drinking water at 0.07 and 0.04 mg  L-1, \n respectively5,7. Nickel can cause medical issues such as asthma, irritation, cardiac and kidney infections, and \npneumonic fibrosis degeneration. Workers heavily in contact with nickel have the highest risk of developing \nlung and nose malignancies. As a result, precisely determining nickel ions in bio-and environmental specimens \nis crucial to examining contamination of the environment and problems with public  health6. Also, recently, the \ndaily intake by children of cereals, candy, fizzy drinks, chocolate, and coca have increased, so it gives a powerful \nreason for the determination of metals such as nickel ions, which might be found in these products.\nIt is known that cocaine is an illegal substance, but it also has a lot of medical uses as an  anesthetic8 but \nunder medical control (healthy limited value). Due to the significant number of surprising products that con-\ntain cocaine, it might be used by children. So, it became urgent to determine Ni(II) ions in these products. \nCocaine is found in nasal  congestion9 and eye  drops10,  toothpaste11, soda  products11 and others. All contain a \nsmall amount of  cocaine11. Given the broad distribution of nickel toxicity in the ecosystem, there is an urgent \nneed to develop innovative techniques for determining trace amounts of Ni(II) ions due to their influence on \nthe health of humans.\nSeveral approaches\u00a0have been implemented to monitor the  Ni(II) ions, including atomic absorption spec -\ntrometry, inductively coupled plasma with either mass spectrometry or optical emission spectrometry, and \nultraviolet\u2013visible  methods12\u201314. However, significant restrictions exist, such as the necessity for training and \nthe usage of advanced tools, as well as lower sensitivity. Electrochemical techniques are widely used because of \ntheir apparatus availability, procedural ease, rapidity, precision, and accuracy, making them ideal for determining \nNi(II) ions. Potentiometric measurements using the ion-selective technique provide several advantages, including \nquick response, easy setup, a significant linear dynamical range, simplified processes, and low resistance. Several \nelectrodes (ISEs) designed mainly for alkaline earth/alkali, heavy, and transition metal ions are now accessible \nfor sale thanks to substantial research in this field.\nWith the generic formulas  MAl2O4 (M = Mg, Zn, etc.) and  MFe2O4 (M = Co, Mg, Mn, Ni, etc.), respectively, \nnumerous nanoparticles of oxide with the  XY2O4 [X is  + 2 oxidation state cation, Y is  + 3 oxidation state cation \nand O anion] structure crystallize as spinel aluminates and ferrites. Eight X, sixteen Y , and thirty-two oxygen \natoms constitute a standard spinel  structure15. In this close packing, 32 octahedral interstices and 64 tetrahe-\ndral interstices are surrounded by six  O2\u2212 ions and four  O2\u2212 ions, respectively. Typically, only 24 cations (8  X2+ \nand 16  Y3+)\u00a0in\u00a0standard spinel are occupied in the 96 interstices (64 tetrahedral and 32 octahedral) between \nthe  anions16,17. Spinel nanoparticles are superior to other materials for electrochemical sensors due to their \nconduction sites for electron transfer, high surface-to-volume ratio, mesoporous structure, and nano size. All \nthe previous facts and findings encourage synthesizing the carbon paste ion selective electrode based on spinel \nnanoparticles. Many spinel oxides have been synthesized by different methods and used as a sensor like Ni\u2013Zn \nferrite  spinel18,  Li1.05Al0.02Mn1.98O419,  CoMn2O420, spinel manganese(IV)  oxide21 and  CuCo2O422. Among the spi-\nnel, magnesium aluminate spinel  (MgAl2O4) has been the focus of researchers due to its properties such as high \nhardness (16\u00a0GPa), high\u00a0mechanical strength\u00a0both at room (135\u2013216\u00a0MPa) as well as at elevated temperatures \n(120\u2013205\u00a0MPa at 1300\u00a0\u00b0C), high resistance against chemical attack, high melting point (2135\u00a0\u00b0C), comprehensive \nband gap energy, high electrical resistivity, relatively low thermal expansion coefficient (9 \u00d7  10\u22126\u00a0\u00b0C\u22121\u00a0between \n30 and 1400\u00a0\u00b0C), low dielectric constant ( \u03b5 = 7.5) and high\u00a0thermal shock  resistance16,23. Magnesium aluminate \n (MgAl2O4) is found in different applications such as neutron radiation resistance, optically transparent ceramics, \ncatalyst, refractory and catalyst support,  etc24.\nSo, this work aims to verify a technique for simultaneously determining the concentration of heavy metals \nsuch as Ni(II) ion. Therefore, the main goal is to describe the synthesis and characterization of nano-magnesium \naluminum spinel and characterize it by a variety of characterization techniques to shed light on the structure and \nbehavior of the spinel, including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), \nscanning electron microscope (SEM), and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) analysis. The prepared spinel nano-\nparticles were used as a modifier in electrodes based on carbon paste to estimate Ni(II) ions in the numbers of \nactual specimens. The electrodes worked well as sensors for detecting Ni(II) in pure form and numerous actual \nsamples. Spinel-NP amount, binder,  H+ ion concentration, temperature, selectivity coefficient, and lifetime effects \nwere thoroughly investigated. The parameters for method validation were examined. The methodology was vali-\ndated using the following primary method validation criteria: limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification \n(LOQ), linearity, and uncertainty measurement. The verified approach was then applied to cocoa, cereal, candy, \nand fizzy drink samples from smallholders and businesses. The ANOV A statistical analysis program was applied \nto validate the proposed potentiometric methos.\nResults and discussion\nXRD for the prepared nano- spinel  (MgAl2O4)\nThe XRD pattern of nano magnesium aluminum spinel  (MgAl2O4) is displayed in Fig.\u00a0 1. The spinel\u2019s cubic crystal \nstructure is verified by the sharp diffraction peaks at two thetas: 18.9\u00b0, 31.3\u00b0, 36.8\u00b0, 44.7\u00b0, 55.6\u00b0, 59.3\u00b0, and 65.1\u00b0, \nwhich are ascribed to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) planes, in that order. The card number \nis COD 9,002,850, and the space group is F d -3 m (227). Without any diffraction peaks linked to other phases, \nthe predominant phase found is spinel, indicating the purity of the magnesium aluminum spinel  (MgAl2O4). \nFurthermore, the Debye\u2013Scherrer equation revealed that the typical crystallite size was in the 35\u00a0nm  range25,26.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |        (2024) 14:16424  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64052-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/The scanning electron microscope attached to the EDAX unit\nUsing a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in aggregation with EDAX, Digital Surf \u2019s Mountains Lab\u00ae, Java \n1.8.0 172 with ImageJ (1.53e) software, the morphology and microstructure of the fabricated spinel nanoparti -\ncles were  analyzed27,28. The spinel nanoparticles\u2019 smooth surface, porous construction, consistent matrix, and \nspherical-like form were all visible in the SEM images (Fig.\u00a0 2A). The synthesized  MgAl2O4 nanoparticles had a \nvariety of pore diameters and particles, as seen by the SEM microphotographs.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a0 2B, the Digital Surf \u2019s Mountains Lab\u00ae software applied a color threshold method on 500\u00a0nm-\nscale SEM microphotographs, which allowed the pores in the material to take distinct colors and showed that \nthe overall percentage of pores was about\u00a023.53% according to the overall measured areas in 500\u00a0nm-scale SEM \nmicrophotographs. To estimate the distribution of particle sizes, the Gaussian mixture model and histogram in \nFig.\u00a0 2C were also generated using Java 1.8.0 172 with ImageJ (1.53e) tool. Spinel nanoparticles were discovered \nto have an average particle size of 51.52\u00a0nm. EDAX data was utilized to determine the chemical composition of \nspinel nanoparticles (Fig.\u00a0 2D)29. The composition is primarily magnesium (7.09%), aluminum (40.57%), and \noxygen (52.34%). In order\u00a0to ascertain the uniformity of the distribution of the constituent elements (Al, Mg, \nand O) in the  MgAl2O4 sample, the atomic percentages of all three elements were compared at various points. \nThe EDAX results confirmed that the distribution of these elements is consistent throughout the sample.\nTransmission electron microscope (TEM) study\nTEM image of the nano spinel  (MgAl2O4) was displayed in Fig.\u00a0 3 (A). The crystallite extent established from \nXRD data (mean crystallite extent = 35\u00a0nm) and SEM image evaluation (mean particle extent = 51.52\u00a0nm) are in \nreasonable conformity with the TEM image, which exposed a particle with a cubic constitute and a size range of \n10.7 to 26.49\u00a0nm and a mean particle size of 17.2\u00a0nm. High levels of crystallinity in the synthesized nano spinel \nwere also confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern\u00a0Fig.\u00a0 3 (B)30.\nBrunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) analysis\nThe spinel nanoparticle  (MgAl2O4) surface area, pore volume, and average pore size must be understood entirely \nregarding nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption. According to the IUPAC-1985 class of physisorption isotherms, \nthe synthetic nano-spinel revealed a type IV-(a)-H3 hysteresis loop  isotherm31. The  N2 adsorption\u2013desorp-\ntion measurement (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1) of the BET analysis indicated a significant rise in the adsorbed \nvolume starting at P/P0 = 0.86. The surface area, mean pore diameter, and pore volume of the nano-spinel were \n61.75\u00a0  m2/g, 8.72\u00a0nm, and 0.256\u00a0  cm3/g, respectively, according to the BET analysis, the spinel nanoparticle had a \nwell-developed mesoporous feature with a high surface  area25,32, 33.\nFigure\u00a01.

They were permitted to equilibrate by stirring before recording their e.m.f. measurements.

Many modified CPEs were prepared \nusing different contents of 5, 10, 15, and 20\u00a0mg of spinel nanoparticles with many plasticizers, namely DEHP , \nTOCP , DBP , o-NPOE, and DIBP . It was evident from Table\u00a0 1 that CPEs modified by 10\u00a0mg of spinel nanoparticles \nand plasticized with TOCP gave a good Nernstian slope of 29.22  \u00b1 0.12\u00a0mV  decade-1.\nInfluence of solvent mediators\nSolvent mediators (plasticizers) are thought to have a crucial influence on how it behaves of carbon paste (CP). \nThey offer several benefits, including improved ionic mobility, increased sensing material solubility, and decreased \ntotal bulk resistance of the sensor due to the polarity properties. They enhanced the mechanical link between \nevery one of the electroactive carbon particles into a homogenous compact  combination35,36. Various solvent \nmediators (DEHP , TOCP , DBP , o-NPOE, DIBP) were subjected to potentiometric measurement, and the obtained \nfindings are shown in Fig.\u00a0 4. The optimal solvent mediator was chosen based on the modified CPE\u2019s potentiomet-\nric performance, which was determined using the Nernstian response and straight domains. The results showed \nthat TOCP was the best solvent mediator for potentiometric measurement of Ni(II) ions. Table\u00a0 1 showed that \nthe electrode plasticized with TOCP only (electrode 9) cannot give a good response or an excellent Nernstian \nslope where it provided low slope. So, TOCP doesn\u2019t have a reason for the good response, as shown in electrode \n2, and it can\u2019t be used to determine the Ni(II) ion. But electrode 2, which contained TOCP with spinel, was the \nbest as it gave the highest Nernstian slope (29.22  \u00b1 0.12\u00a0mV  decade-1) than the others.\nQualitative and quantitative computed optimization\nAn original design aimed to determine the type of plasticizer (binder) and ionophore content (mg) best suited \nto the sensor performance. The design contained nine sensors and five distinct plasticizers (DEHP , TOCP , DBP , \no-NPOE, and DIBP). The Design Expert\u00ae created a prediction model based on the experimental results.

The predicted slopes significantly correlate with the \nactual ones, as shown in Figs.\u00a0 4 and 5 , when TOCP and graphite are utilized in constant amounts.

The potentials have been determined for 1.0 \u00d7  10\u22123 and \n1.0 \u00d7  10\u22125 mol  L-1 of Ni(II) ions at various pH levels (1\u20139). As previously stated in the experimental section, \ndiluted solutions of HCl or NaOH were employed to modify the pH from 1 to 9. The findings revealed that the \npotential response remained consistent across the range of 2.0\u20137.0, which was adjusted using buffer solution \nas acetate or phosphate, as seen in Fig.\u00a0 7. The improved Ni(II)-CPE functioned well in the pH range of 2.0\u20137.0, \nwith minimal interference from  H+ or,  OH\u2212 which is a broader pH range than shown in other previous studies \nthat were 5\u2013837 or 6.5\u20138.538. The shifts occurred at pH levels less than two or greater than 7, indicating decreased \nNi(II)-CPE performance. This behavior could be clarified as an outcome of competition with hydrogen ions in \nhigh acidity and the formation of both soluble and insoluble Ni(II) ion hydroxyl complexes, which precipitated \nat high pH levels.\nTemperature study\nThe improved Ni-ISE\u2019s performance in test solutions was assessed at various temperatures (10, 25, 30, 40, 50, and \n60\u00a0\u00b0C). The standard cell potentials (E\u00b0cell) were determined at different temperatures using the point intercepts \nof the relevant calibration plots at pNi(II) = 0. They were used to estimate the isothermal temperature coefficient \n(dE\u00b0/dt): Ecell\u00b0 = Ecell\u00b0 (25)  + ( dE\u00b0/dT) (t\u201325).\nThe sensor gave a good Nernstian response within the temperature range of 10\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C. The straight\u2013line slope \nwas obtained from the relation of  Ecell\u00b0 (y-axis) and t\u201325 (x-axis), where the isothermal coefficient of MCPE \nequals 0.957 mV/C. The small values of the isothermal coefficient showed high thermal stability. The standard \npotential of the reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) was calculated at the different temperatures using the following \nequation: y = 0.9486x + 197.85, Ecell = 197.85+ 0.9486 (t\u201325).\nResponse time and lifetime study\nResponse time and electrode life are critical components of any potentiometric sensor\u2019s analytical  performance39. \nThe average reaction time is the time it takes for a sensor to attain a stable voltage (\u00b1 1\u00a0mV) of the equilibrium \nvalue. This value was measured by dipping the electrode progressively in a series of target ion solutions. The \naverage time for the electrode to achieve a constant potential response within \u00b1 1\u00a0mV of the ultimate equilibrium \nvalue. The reaction time of the ideal modified CPE was measured by increasing the Ni(II) ion concentration \nfrom 5.0 \u00d7  10\u22128 to 1.0 \u00d7  10\u22122 mol  L\u22121 (Fig.\u00a0 8). As a result, the electrode reached the equilibrium value very quickly \nafter  ~ 8\u00a0s, which reflected the incorporation of the best content of spinel and good solvent mediator where it is \nequal to 11\u00a0s as found in the previous  study40 or equal 10 s as in Alizadeh et\u00a0al .  report34. The lifetime was esti -\nmated by developing the calibration diagram under optimum conditions at an extended time, and it reached \nnine weeks without a critical change in the slopes of the calibration diagram, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 9, that is a longer \nlifetime (3\u20135 weeks) as previously  reported37.\nSelectivity coefficient study\nThe potentiometric selectivity factors were also calculated, which are the most essential factor in determining \nits characteristics. These coefficients have demonstrated that the electrode response varies in the presence of an \ninterrupting ion (B) relative to the target Ni(II) ion. The selectivity coefficients were obtained using multiple \napproaches, including the matched potential method (MPM) and the separation solution method (SSM)41\u201343.\nIn SSM, the assessment is made by measuring the potential of the interfering and target ions in a cell of a \nsensor and a reference electrode. The alteration is made using two solutions: one of the desired ions (Ni(II)) in \nthe absence of competing species (no B) and the E of it. The second solution includes the interfering species B 1.0 \u00d710-3 M \n1.0 \u00d710-5 M \n0306090120150180\n0 123456789 10E, mV \npH\nFigure\u00a07.

For these cations, the selectivity parameters were obtained using \nthe Eisenman  technique44.\nIn MPM, they define this as \"the ratio of the main concentration of ions to the interrupting ion concentration \nthat resulted in the same potential change as the reference solution.\" It does not obey the Eisenman equation. So, \nit is appropriate for neutral sugars and carbs such as maltose and  starch36. Figure\u00a0 10 showed that the produced \nelectrode showed different selectivity for the target ion compared to the evaluated cations (alkali and transi-\ntion metal ions). The selectivity coefficients (logK Ni(II)) for modified CPE towards various inorganic cations, \ncarbohydrates, and sugars were tested using several techniques such as SSM \"separated solution method\" and \n\"MPM \"matching potential method.\" The results showed none of the evaluated interfering species could have a \nhigh selectivity coefficient.\nThis suggested that these ions have no significant impact on the reaction obtained with nickel ions. As a \nresult, the improved sensor demonstrated high effectiveness and selectivity in detecting Ni(II) ions dissolved in \ndiverse interfering materials. This may be explained in terms of ionic size variations, which affect mobilities and \npermeability. Sugars\u2019 remarkable selectivity is primarily due to the difference in polarity and lipophilic nature of \ntheir molecules compared with Ni(II), which causes no appreciable interference.1.0\u00d710\u22122\n1.0\u00d710\u22125\n 5.0\u00d710\u221281.0\u00d710\u22123\n1.0\u00d710\u22124\n 1.0\u00d710\u221271.0\u00d710\u22126\n0255075100125150175\n02 55 07 51 00 125 150 175 200 225 250 275(a)E, mv\nt, sec\n7090110130150170190\n0369 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 421.0\u00d710\u22126 mol L- 1\n1.0\u00d710\u22124 mol L- 1(b)\n t, sec\nFigure\u00a08.

Table\u00a0 3 illustrated the recovery values of 97.07\u2013101.30% with \nSD = 0.14\u20130.99 for the proposed sensor. Furthermore, the relative standard deviation (RSD%) values for all five \nreplicate estimates were less than 5. These results supported the recommended sensor\u2019s repeatability, accuracy, \nand ability to recover quickly.\nThe results obtained from the potentiometric calibration method were compared to those from the induc -\ntively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique. This comparison obtained was summarized in \nTable\u00a0 4, which showed recoveries values in the range from 96.00 to 99.85% and from 97.14 to 101.69% with \nSD = 0.05\u20131.00 and 0.04\u20130.09 for potentiometric calibration and ICP methods, respectively. Statistical evaluation \nof the results of the Ni(II) ion analysis in the pure solution and the spikes of some actual samples showed good \nrecovery and relative standard deviation results, indicating the proposed electrode\u2019s high accuracy and precision. \nThese results were also compared with the results of the ICP technique, which showed this method\u2019s advantages \nand no significant difference between the two techniques.\nMethod validation\nAccreditation of electroanalytical procedures is a strategy created to determine if a determination methodology \nused for particular measurements is acceptable for its intended purpose and comparable to other  techniques45\u201347. \nUsing standard solutions, validation tests were conducted to validate accuracy, detection limits, measurement \nlimits, linearity, precision, and specificity.\nAccuracy and precision may be described as the values closest to the same when validated, regardless of \nwhether they are traditional, accurate, or acceptable reference values and the value discovered. Precisions were \nmeasured intra-day and inter-day using four separate samples of two concentrations each. The relative standard \ndeviations were found to be relatively minimal, indicating that the selected approach is reasonably repeatable, as \nshown in Table\u00a0 3. As a result, the accuracy of the chosen potentiometric approach was calculated as a percentage \nrelative standard deviation (RSD%) utilizing the sensors being evaluated. Table\u00a0 3 showed the RSD% results for \nrepeated determinations.\nThe linearity of an electroanalytical procedure is measured by how closely the calibration chart of the electro -\nanalytical response to concentration approximates a straight line. As previously stated, the standard calibration \ngraph was generated by measuring five distinct amounts of Ni(II) as standard solutions. It was discovered that \nthe electrode potential [mV] and the logarithm of Ni (II) concentration were linearly correlated.

To summarize, suitable distilled water was used to dissolve stoichiometric amounts of \nmagnesium chloride hexahydrate and aluminum chloride hexahydrate. The mixture was then thoroughly com-\nbined while being continuously stirred. Ammonia solution was added drop by drop to get the blended solution \nto a pH of 10.5. The precipitate was repeatedly cleaned using an ethanol and distilled water solution. After that, \nthe precipitates were dried for 24\u00a0h at 90\u00a0\u00b0C in an oven and then calcined for an hour at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C using a 5\u00a0\u00b0C/\nmin heating rate. Before being employed as an ionophore in a carbon paste electrode to detect nickel ions in \nactual samples, the synthesized nano-spinel was subjected to various analytical techniques, including XRD SEM \nin conjunction with EDAX, TEM, and BET analysis.\nSensor\u2019s modification\nThey were prepared by mixing graphite powder, solvent mediator, and spinel nanoparticle by 67.3:30.5:2.7 (wt.%). \nThen, they were put in a dry and cold place until utilization.

The prepared magnesium aluminum spinel nanoparticle using the co-precipitation method, fully \ncharacterized by different characterization techniques to confirm the phase composition, nano size, high surface \narea, and mesoporous characters. The proposed potentiometric sensor revealed excellent response characteristics \nregarding stability and reversibility. It is clear that the dynamic ranges from 5.0 \u00d7  10\u22128 to 1.0 \u00d7  10\u22122\u00a0mol  L-1 at \nroom temperature with a detection limit of 5.0 \u00d7  10\u22128\u00a0mol  L-1. In addition to a fast response time of 8\u00a0s, it can be \nused for nine weeks with good reproducibility. Also, it is selective against several interference substances. The \nproposed sensor was successfully applied to determine nickel ions in some samples, including cocaine, candy, \ncoca, chocolate, and fizzy drinks. It also provides a good agreement (accuracy and precision) with the validation \napproaches, and the results outperform the IUPAC\u00a0and\u00a0ICH Q2(R1) recommendations.\nData availability\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article [and its supplementary \ninformation files].\nReceived: 25 February 2024; Accepted: 4 June 2024\nReferences\n 1.
