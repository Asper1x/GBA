Parathyroid hormone\u2013related peptide (PTHrP) produced by the placenta adds additional complexity. Our \ncase is the first to demonstrate an increased rate of PTH degradation within a pregnant individual who returned unexpectedly low PTH levels. We \ndescribe a 27-year-old female patient who presented at 25 weeks gestation with pancreatitis and hypercalcemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism \nwas suspected but variable PTH results led to uncertainty and an assay error was considered. PTH samples were collected in both serum- separating tubes (SST) and EDTA tubes and compared to controls (5 nonpregnant and 5 pregnant individuals). Samples were retested every 2 \nhours for a period of 10 hours. A rapid decline in the measured PTH was noted in the index case, an observation which differed from \ncontrols. We postulated that internal and/or external factors influenced the PTH measurement obtained from our patient. From our \nobservations, rapid PTH degradation in pregnancy, and individual variation in PTH stability and laboratory processes, can influence PTH results and impact on interpreting hypercalcemia in pregnancy.\nKey Words: primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid hormone, pregnancy, parathyroid adenoma, hypercalcemia\nAbbreviations: 4D-CT, four-dimensional computed tomography; BMI, body mass index; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTH1R, parathyroid hormone receptor; \nPTHrP, parathyroid hormone\u2013related peptide; SST, serum-separating tubes.\nReceived: 29 April 2024.

The most com -\nmon cause in pregnancy is a benign parathyroid adenoma; however, familial and genetic syndromes should also be con\n-\nsidered ( 2).\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) is an 84-amino-acid (AA) pep -\ntide hormone that binds PTH-1 receptors (PTH1R). This re -\nsults in upregulation of heterotrimeric G (G\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) protein \ncoupling pathways of cyclic AMP, G \u03b1s and G \u03b1q, and subse -\nquent activation of protein kinase A and C ( 3). Vitamin D \nand calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is medi -\nated via this pathway. PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) is pro -\nduced predominantly in pregnancy by the placenta. It is homologous to the N-terminal 1-34 of PTH and binds to \nPTH1R with similar affinity (\n4). In pregnancy, the release of \nPTHrP in the second and third trimester maintains the \nplacental-fetal calcium gradient required for fetal bone min -\neralization and major organ development ( 3, 5).\nUntreated hypercalcemia can result in maternal and fetal com -\nplications in 67% and 80% of cases, respectively ( 6). Elevated \ncalcium levels are associated with maternal hypertension, \npreeclampsia, nephrolithiasis, pancreatitis, and hypercalcemic crisis (7 ). Intrauterine growth restriction, neonatal hypocalce -\nmia, and perinatal death have been described ( 8, 9). Compared \nto the baseline population, a 3.5-fold increase in the incidence \nof pregnancy loss in women with primary hyperparathyroidism \nis observed, particularly with corrected calcium (Ca corr) levels \n> 2.86 mmol/L (11.46 mg/dL) (normal range, 2.10-2.60 \n[8.40-10.4]) (7). Miscarriage typically occurs in the first or early second trimester of pregnancy, highlighting the importance of \nearly diagnosis and treatment of this condition (10).\nThe diagnosis of PTH-dependent hypercalcemia is often \nchallenging in pregnancy due to altered physiology. The rise \nin PTHrP is accompanied by a 50% drop in maternal PTH lev -\nels (11). In pregnancy, urinary fractional excretion of calcium \nabove 1% is unreliable as an ancillary test in diagnosing pri -\nmary hyperparathyroidism as the renal plasma flow increases \nby 40% to 65% ( 12, 13). Race, age, body mass index (BMI), \nand vitamin D deficiency further impact the physiological lev -\nels of PTH ( 14). Conventional imaging such as sestamibi \n[9mTc-MIBI] and four-dimensional computed tomography \n(4D-CT) are avoided, and ultrasonography remains the pre -\nferred investigation ( 15). Given these limitations, it is impera -\ntive that the PTH assay is reliable, as clinical acumen is key in \nthe diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy.\nCase Presentation\nA 27-year-old female patient (G5P1M4) was transferred to \nour tertiary center at 25 weeks gestation with pancreatitis. She reported a history of recurrent pancreatitis of unclear etiology and symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Eight years prior at another health service, she had an emergency cesarean delivery at 32 weeks gestation due to pan\n-\ncreatitis and severe pre-eclampsia. Retrospectively, it was noted that she was hypercalcemic at the time with a Ca\ncorr \nof 2.75 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL). Unfortunately, this had not been further investigated. On admission, she had been taking a pregnancy multivitamin daily and had no other medical history.\nUpon presentation to our center, she was hypercalcemic with \na Ca corr of 2.85 mmol/L (11.4 mg/dL), and ionized calcium of \n1.54 mmol/L (6.16 mg/dL) (normal range, 1.16-1.31 [4.65-5.25]). Her phosphate was 0.47 mmol/L (1.46 mg/dL) (normal range, 0.75-1.50 [2.32-4.65]), creatinine was 43 \u03bcmolEL (0.49 mg/dL) (normal range, 44-97 [0.50-1.10]) \nand vitamin D was 117 nmol/L (46.8 ng/mL) (normal range, \n50-150 [20-60]). The urinary fractional excretion of calcium \nusing the Hammersmith equation was 0.0124 (1.24%). There was no known family history of hypercalcemia.\nHer initial PTH was low but not completely suppressed at \n1.70 pmol/L (16.03 pg/mL) (normal range, 1.00-7.00 [9.43-66.01]). Serial testing of PTH levels unexpectedly varied \nand ranged from 0.80-5.40 pmol/L (7.54-50.92 pg/mL). We \nnoted that the lower PTH results were returned from samples \nfollowing delayed processing times (Fig. 1\n). Samples processed \nimmediately found PTH to be inappropriately normal in keep -\ning with PTH-dependent hypercalcemia. We liaised with our \nbiochemical pathologists to further characterize the factors in -\nfluencing PTH variability in pregnancy. We hypothesized that \nPTH variability was impacted by the time to sample analysis.Diagnostic Assessment\nWe assessed PTH stability on the Siemens Atellica Intact PTH Assay by collecting paired blood samples in serum-separating tubes (SST) and EDTA tubes from 10 individuals (n = 5 preg\n-\nnant, n = 5 nonpregnant) and compared them with paired \nsamples collected from the index case. PTH was measured in each sample at timepoint zero (0 hours) and then every 2 \nhours for the next 10 hours. The absolute changes in measured \nPTH concentration were calculated (\nTables 1 and 2).\nThe small difference in PTH results observed in SST and \nEDTA samples at baseline for the controls and index case can be explained by the inherent variability of the PTH assay. However, with time, the variation in PTH levels observed be\n-\ntween SST and EDTA samples for the controls were in oppos -\nite directions, with a 11% reduction and 5.9% increase at 10 hours, respectively (\nFig. 2 ). The changes observed in the SST \ncohort started to exceed the limits of analytical variability 8 hours after baseline measurement. In our index case, PTH lev\n-\nels fell more rapidly by 38.1% and 12.5% in the SST and \nEDTA tube, respectively. The changes observed in the SST \nsample for our patient exceeded the analytical variability limit at 4 hours from baseline.\nTreatment\nFrom day 6 of admission, PTH samples were sent immediately to the laboratory for analysis to improve accuracy (Fig. 3\n). \nDespite continuous intravenous fluids, cinacalcet, and furosem -\nide, the serum calcium level continued to rise. Bisphosphonate was not given due to safety concerns in pregnancy. At 28 weeks of pregnancy, the peak Ca\ncorr was noted to be 3.18 mmol/L \n[12.75 mg/dL], with an ionized calcium of 1.64 mmol/L \n[6.57 mg/dL]). We proceeded with ultrasonography and \n4D-CT of the neck, which confirmed a 5 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 6 mm right \nFigure 1.

She experienced no surgical complications and later proceeded to an unevent\n-\nful delivery at 38 weeks gestation. Six weeks postpartum, she remained normocalcemic with a Ca\ncorr of 2.35 mmol/L (9.42 mg/dL). The histology of the surgical specimen con -\nfirmed a parathyroid adenoma and subsequent genetic testing for multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 was negative.\nDiscussion\nOur case is the first to describe the rate of PTH degradation in pregnancy and demonstrates the importance of understanding pregnancy-related changes when interpreting biochemistry.\nCurrently, no standardized PTH measurement method ex -\nists, and both second- and third-generation PTH assays are freely used in commercial laboratories.

Interlaboratory validity is therefore difficult to rely upon (16).\nThe second-generation \u201cintact\u201d PTH assay, utilizes a capture \nantibody against the C-terminus (AA 39-84) and a detection antibody against the N-terminus of PTH (AA 12-18, 13-24, \nor 26-32) (17). Besides biologically active PTH (1-84), \nN-terminal truncated PTH fragments which stimulate PTH1R \nare also detected, and account for up to 20% of the circulating PTH (17-19). In contrast, the third-generation assay is more specific for PTH (1-84) and binds to the first 4 AA molecules \nof PTH directly via an anti-N-terminal antibody (20\n). Thus, \ncaution must be exerted when interpreting the PTH measure -\nments, especially when comparing between laboratories.Dai et al (21 ) reported that PTH samples obtained in EDTA \ntubes held stability for up to 72 hours when compared to hep -\narin anticoagulant, coagulant, gel separating, and plain tubes. \nThis was congruent with our control cohort observation, whereby the control EDTA samples were more stable over time compared to the control SST samples. In contrast, our in\n-\ndex case exhibited a faster rate of PTH degradation compared \nto controls with both the SST and EDTA methods ( Fig. 2). \nOur study highlights the issues relating to PTH variability in \na real-world situation.\nInterestingly, our study noted the PTH results initially in -\ncremented in the EDTA samples of our control group; a phe -\nnomenon previously noted but not evaluated ( 22, 23). In \ncontrast, our individual\u2019s PTH levels in the EDTA tube did \nFigure 2.

A negative rate of change was \nmore pronounced in the index case compared to the control groups in both collection tubes.4                                                                                                                                                              JCEM Case Reports, 2024, Vol. 2, No. 9\nnot replicate this pattern. Further statistical interpretation was \nlimited by sample size.\nThis was purely an observational study, and several factors \nwhich could impact the baseline PTH in our observed individ -\nuals were not accounted for. Theoretical concerns regarding \nsample storage temperature and protein degradation also exist \nbut were unable to be directly assessed in this instance (24).\nExcessive consumption of biotin (found in over-the-counter \nsupplements) can falsely lower PTH levels due to immunoassay \ninterference (25). BMI and Black race, have also been positively \ncorrelated to PTH levels (26). Bolland et al (27) reported that \nnormocalcemic individuals with obesity were likely to have \nhigher PTH levels compared to their nonobese counterparts. \nFinally, as our nonpregnant and pregnant control samples \nwere selected at random, we were unable to draw direct com-\nparisons to nonpregnant individuals with primary hyperpara -\nthyroidism. In order to further delineate the impact these \nfactors have on PTH degradation, we propose more vigorous \nscreening, collection, and processing methods in future studies.\nThis case highlighted the importance of liaising with our \nchemical pathology colleagues when biochemical results are \nnot in keeping with the clinical presentation, especially in preg-\nnant individuals. In collaboration, we successfully identified the abnormality of our individual\u2019s PTH sample relative to con-\ntrols, which resulted in the time-critical diagnosis and treatment \nof this individual\u2019s primary hyperparathyroidism.\nGiven the small numbers of subjects assessed, the interpret -\nation of the study remains limited. Caution should be exer-\ncised when interpreting PTH levels in pregnancy, especially \nif there is a high clinical index of suspicion for primary hyper -\nparathyroidism. In such a situation, the clinician must con-\nsider pregnancy, assay, and individual factors which may \nimpact on the measured PTH and the synthesis of the case.\nLearning Points\n\u2022Hypercalcemia in pregnancy poses significant maternofetal \nrisk\u2014it should be identified, investigated, and treated \npromptly.\n\u2022Physiological changes in pregnancy alter the ability to use \nconventional investigations to accurately diagnose pri-\nmary hyperparathyroidism.\n\u2022The rate of PTH degradation in pregnancy has previously \nnot been examined and should be considered when inter-\npreting PTH results.\nFigure 3.Corrected calcium (mmol/L) and corresponding parathyroid hormone (PTH) results (pmol/L) for the index case over time (days from admission to \nhospital).
