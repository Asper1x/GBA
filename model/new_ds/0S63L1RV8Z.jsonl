However, comparative studies on soil bacterial communities of Chinese ginger\nvarieties, especially after \ufb02ooding, are lacking. Here, we comprehensively compared the\nbacterial communities of two types of ginger soils from four different locations. Surprisingly,the 100-year \ufb02ood (20 July 2021, in Henan, China) did not signi \ufb01cantly affect the soil bacte-\nrial composition compared with previous reports. In contrast, \ufb02ooding may have brought\nin nutrients and promoted the propagation of eutrophic bacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria\nwere the most abundant in the Zhangliang region ( ;25%). However, due to the most\nsevere \ufb02ooding and inundation, the Zhangliang region, also probably contaminated\nwith polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals, showed the lowest microbial\ndiversity. Moreover, the geographical location in \ufb02uenced the microbial communities\nmore than did the soil type or ginger variety.

After a 100-year \ufb02ood (20 July 2021, in Henan,\nChina), we comprehensively compared the bacterial communities of two types of ginger\nsoils from four different locations. Surprisingly, this \ufb02ood did not signi \ufb01cantly affect the\nsoil bacterial composition compared with previous reports. In contrast, it was found that\nthe\ufb02ooding may have brought in nutrients and promoted the propagation of eutrophic\nbacteria for the Zhangliang region. However, the \ufb02ooding had also brought in polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination. Moreover, we also veri \ufb01ed that\ngeographical location in \ufb02uenced the microbial communities more than did the soil type\nor ginger variety. These \ufb01ndings help us understand the species and composition of\nbacteria and infection of ginger after \ufb02ooding and soaking.\nKEYWORDS ginger, soil bacterial colony, diversity analysis, \ufb02ooding disaster\nGinger ( Zingiber of \ufb01cinale ) has a deep historical background of extensive cultivation\nworldwide, especially in China, with more than 2,500 years of cultivation since the\nSpring and Autumn period of China (1, 2). Huaijiang (HJ) ginger, Zhangliang ginger,\nPanghai (PH) ginger, and Shannong ginger are some of the well-known Chinese ginger\nvarieties. Ginger in Chinese medicines has been used to dispel cold, dispel sweat, pro-mote hair growth, and strengthen the stomach (3, 4). In addition, ginger is an impor-\ntant \ufb02avor seasoning for Chinese cuisine, with the role of removing \ufb01shy fragrance,\nshowing its great economic and medicinal value (3, 4). The growth and development\nof the ginger plant require several nutrients (including nitrogen, phosphorus, andEditor Florian M. Freimoser, Agroscope\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Li et al.

However,\nalong with bene \ufb01cial microorganisms, soil also comprises some pathogenic microor-\nganisms, which inhibit crop growth (3, 6). Thus, it is important to characterize the com-\nmunity structure of ginger soil microorganisms (2, 5).\nIn soil microbial sequencing, a bacterial genome \u2019s 16S rRNA gene fragment is \ufb01rst\nampli \ufb01ed and sequenced, followed by studying the colony type and microorganism\nstructure through bioinformatic analyses (3, 5, 7, 8). Recently, with the development ofresearch and technology, second-generation high-throughput sequencing (NGS) tech-\nnology has emerged, which is a modi \ufb01cation of the traditional Sanger sequencing\n(9\u201311). This technology can sequence many microbial DNA molecules in the V4 region\nof a soil sample in parallel in a single run and has a substantial quantitative capability,\nwhere the number of times a DNA sample is sequenced directly re \ufb02ects the DNA abun-\ndance of that sample. The analysis is usually performed using 16S rRNA sequencingand bioinformatics. Based on the sequencing results, the microbial communities are\nclassi \ufb01ed by the degree of similarity into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (3, 7, 12).\nBased on OTUs, researchers can perform various soil microbial characterizations, suchas soil microbial analyses of localized homogeneous environmental species diversity\n(\na-diversity analysis), principal-component analysis (PCA), and composition analyses of\nmicrobial communities (3, 13).\nPrevious studies have comparatively analyzed the microbial communities of healthy\nand diseased ginger (3, 7). Also, turmeric and ginger intercropping affects the propor-tion of dominant bacteria and increases the active ingredient contents in patchouli\n(14). However, fewer studies have focused on the community structure of ginger soil\nbacteria after the \ufb02oods of 20 July 2021, a 100-year \ufb02ood disaster in Henan Province in\nnorth-central China. Many cash crops, including ginger, suffered from \ufb02ooding and\nrain inundation for 2 or more months (15). We collected ginger soil samples in\nSeptember/October 2021, when the \ufb02oods had largely subsided. We investigated the\neffects of \ufb02ood inundation on the diversity of bacterial colonies in ginger soil for 2\nmonths. Our objective is to compare bacterial rhizosphere community structures of\ntwo types of ginger soils from four different locations subjected to a major \ufb02ood disas-\nter. The general technical \ufb02ow is shown in Fig. 1.\nRESULTS\nData processing and OTU acquisition. After format conversion and sequencing\ndata splitting, we extracted 4,365,450 OTU tags, averaging 136,420.31 OTU tags per\ngroup. Tags are the data showing that the \ufb01ltered sequences correctly overlap and\ncontain the correct barcode and high-quality reads. We obtained 4,198,089 clean OTU\ntags after low-quality data \ufb01ltering, with a validity rate of 96.17% and an average of\n1,311,190.28 clean OTU tags per group (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Forthe following analyses, clean OTU data were used. To facilitate comparative analyses,\nfour groups were assigned corresponding to the soil collection locations (Table 1).\nFIG 1 The general technical \ufb02ow. The technical process consists of the following six steps: sampling, genome DNA extraction, library construction, NGS,\ndata processing, and statistics and analyses.Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum\nMarch/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 2\nTo identify the sharing and uniqueness of OTUs among groups, we plotted the\nVenn diagrams under different categorization method conditions (Fig. 2). In the \ufb01rst\ncategorization method (category 1, Fig. 2A), each group, including the control group,\nhad an amount of unique OTUs (13 to 708 species), with ginger soil in the MZJSH\ngroup having 13 unique OTUs (the least) and the ginger soil in the ZLJ group having708 unique OTUs (the most). The number of these unique OTUs (bacterial commun-\nities) may be related to soil fertility and geographical location, and the type of these\nunique OTUs is likely related to the characteristic quality of the local ginger. However,\nin this study, the factor of \ufb02ooding cannot be ignored, especially in the most severely\naffected regions of Zhangliang. The eight groups also shared 1,399 OTUs.\nThe second categorization method (category 2, Fig. 2B) and the third categorization\nmethod (category 3, Fig. 2D) were classi \ufb01ed based on region (including the blank con-\ntrol groups) and ginger origin, respectively. In both categorization methods, the shared\nOTUs were similar, and any of the two groups had shared OTUs. Still, each group had\nits own unique OTUs. Although the soil types of MZST and MZSH were different, the\ntwo groups had the most OTUs in common, probably because their sampling locations\nare only 2 to 3 km apart. The fourth categorization method (category 4, Fig. 2C) was\nclassi \ufb01ed according to ginger type, with PH ginger, a large ginger bulb variety, having\nhigher diversity than HJ ginger, a small ginger bulb variety, with the two types of gin-\nger sharing 13,784 OTUs.\nRank abundance curve. To further investigate the richness and uniformity of the\nbacterial species contained in each sample, we sorted the OTUs of each sample by\nabundance and then analyzed their abundance ranking levels. The OTU with the high-est proportion in each group had a similar abundance range (from 0.1% to 1%) (Fig. 3).\nIn contrast, the OTUs with low abundance were considerably different (Fig. 3; the\nlength of a broken line on the horizontal axis represents the species number of OTU\nwith this abundance).\nAccording to category 1 (Fig. 3A), the species richness and uniformity of most groups\nof blank controls were less than their own corresponding ginger soil groups, indicating\nthat the growth of ginger plants also promoted the prosperity of bacterial colony diver-sity. The results were contrasting for the MZSH group, probably because the MZSHBC\ngroup \u2019s sampling site was in the vicinity of the MZJSH group, resulting in little difference\nbetween them.\nIn addition, according to categories 1 to 3 (Fig. 3A to C), among the ginger soil\ngroups, MZJST had the most diverse and relatively uniform OTUs, and the ZLJ group\nhad the least, implying that the Zhangliang region has a lower bacterial diversity than\nothers. Regarding ginger varieties (category 4, Fig. 3D), the addition of LZJ decreasedthe OTU difference (diversity and uniformity) between the HJ and PH groups.\nComposition analyses of microbial communities. We analyzed the dominant bac-\nterial communities at two representative taxonomic levels for the further comparison\nbetween groups. The statistical results at both the phylum and genus levels are shown\nin Fig. 4 and in Fig. S2 in the supplemental material.

Four ginger soil groups were set up with their blank controls (BC), each group containing four samples, tota ling 32 samples (Table 2).\nThey were named ZLJ01-04, ZLBC01-04, MZJST01-04, MZSTBC01-04, MZJSH01-04, MZSHBC01-04, LZJ01-04, and LZBC01-04.

However, some differences\nin abundance existed among bacterial categories between groups (Fig. 4). Among them,\n[Chlorobacteria] are a special class of Acidobacteria phylum.\nAccording to categories 1 to 3 (Fig. 4A to C), the bacterial colony composition\nof the Zhangliang region (ZLJ and ZLBC) was considerably different from that of\nother groups. For instance, compared with other groups (Zhangliang versus others), the\nAcidobacteria -6 (;12.5% versus ;25%), Chloracidobacteria (;2% versus ;10%),\nand Nitrospirae (;2% versus ;10%) were less abundant in the Zhangliang region.\nAcidobacteria -6 and Chloracidobacteria can help ginger plants adapt to acidic ecological envi-\nronments and absorb their nutrients better. For example, chemoautotrophic bacteria can\nFIG 2 Identi \ufb01cation of the shared and unique OTUs among groups using Venn diagrams. Four different classi \ufb01cation methods are presented. (A) The \ufb01rst\nclassi \ufb01cation method was based on ginger groups and blank controls. (B) The second classi \ufb01cation method was based on regions. (C) The third\nclassi \ufb01cation method was based on the four ginger groups. (D) The fourth classi \ufb01cation method was based on ginger varieties (PH and HJ). The naming\nrules are as follows. ZL, MZ, and LZ refer to the sampling sites: Lushan (Zhangliang) and Mengzhou and Xinmi (Liuzhai). J refers to the abbreviation ofChinese \u201cjiang \u201d(ginger). ST refers to sandy soil; SH refers to the mixed soil of sandy soil and dark loessal soil. In addition, BC refers to \u201cblank control. \u201dGinger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum\nMarch/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 4\ntake CO2as a carbon source, promoting the circulation and metabolism of iron and elemen-\ntal sulfur (12). Nitrospirae are Gram-negative bacteria; among them, nitri \ufb01ers can oxidize ni-\ntrite into nitrate, promoting nitrogen \ufb01xation, which is indispensable (12).\nIn addition, compared with other regions, Alphaproteobacteria were more abundant in\nthe Zhangliang region ( ;25% versus ;11%). However, Proteobacteria are considered eutro-\nphic, and Acidobacteria are oligotrophic (16 \u201318), suggesting that \ufb02ooding may have\nbrought in more nutrients and promoted the propagation of eutrophic bacteria in the\nZhangliang region. This may be the \ufb01rst consequence of the \ufb02ooding and soaking.\nTheGemmatimonadetes in the ZLBC group were more abundant than in other groups. The\nabundance of Thaumarchaeota was contrasting between the groups. Thaumarchaeota are\nthe only known archaea in nature besides methanogens that considerably participate inthe carbon and nitrogen element cycle (12). Thaumarchaeota in the ZLBC group were sig-\nni\ufb01cantly lower. For the Zhangliang region, the difference between the HJ group and the\nPH group became smaller due to the addition of the Liuzhai region (Fig. 4D). At the classlevel, the group \u2019s classi \ufb01cation was similar to that at the phylum level (data not shown).\nAt the genus level (Fig. S2), we compared the bacterial community composition of each\nFIG 3 Abundance grade analyses of the OTUs of the bacterial communities in ginger soil samples. The abundance grade curve arranges the OTU in each\nsample according to its abundance along the abscissa and connects them (the species of OTU with the same abundance) with a broken line according to\nits abundance as the ordinate to re \ufb02ect the distribution of OTU abundance in each sample. For each microbial community sample, the curve can directly\nre\ufb02ect the numbers of high-abundance and rare OTUs in the community. Both the richness and evenness of the species in the sample are explained. The\nlonger or gentler the curve, the more abundant and uniform the diversity of soil bacterial colonies in the region. The shorter or steeper the curve, the less\ndiverse and uneven the bacterial colonies in the soil. (A) The \ufb01rst categorization was based on ginger and control groups. (B) The second was based on\nregions. (C) The third was based on the four ginger groups. (D) The fourth was based on ginger varieties (PH and HJ).Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum\nMarch/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 5\ngroup, especially the top nine dominant bacterial species ( \u201cCandidatus Nitrososphaera, \u201d\nKaistobacter ,Nitrospira ,Planctomyces ,Bacillus ,Rhodoplanes ,Steroidobacter ,Gemmata ,a n d\nPirellula ). According to the four categorization methods, the composition of bacterial colo-\nnies in the Zhangliang region (ZLJ and ZLBC) differed signi \ufb01cantly from that in other\ngroups; for example, \u201cCandidatus Nitrososphaera \u201d(e.g., Nitrospira )i sb e n e \ufb01cial for the nitro-\ngen \ufb01xation of ginger, but it is less abundant than others in the Zhangliang region.\nMeanwhile, Kaistobacter is more abundant than in other regions, indicating that the soil in\nthe Zhangliang region was probably polluted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\nor heavy metals (12, 19). In addition, compared with other regions, the amount of\nGeobacter in the Zhangliang region was considerably higher than that in the other groups,\nindicating that the soil was probably polluted by a heavy metal (arsenic [As]) because\nGeobacter sulfurreducens is positively associated with the migration and transformation of\narsenic in soil (20, 21). This may be another consequence of \ufb02ooding and soaking.\nGenetic evolution analyses of microbial communities. To display the genetic\nevolution relationship of bacterial communities in each group, we conducted genetic\nevolution analyses of the top 60 microbial communities in abundance at the genus\nlevel using heat maps (Fig. 5). The branch lines of genetic evolution at the top of the\ufb01gure indicate that the soil bacterial communities from the same region can always\ncluster together, implying that the closer the sampling location is, the more similar the\nFIG 4 The bacterial community composition at the phylum level.

(D) The fourth was based on ginger varieties (PH and HJ). It is worth noting that[Chlorobacteria] are a class of Acidobacteria phylum with a relatively large abundance.Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum\nMarch/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 6\nsoil bacterial communities are (Fig. 5A). Especially for category 1, although MZSTBC \u2019s\nand MZSHBC \u2019s soil types were inconsistent, they were clustered together because they\nbelonged to the same Mengzhou region. For category 2 (Fig. 5B), the differences in the\nbacterial communities between regions were more signi \ufb01cant, with almost all bacterial\nspecies having different abundances in the four sampling sites. The Zhangliang andLiuzhai regions showed almost opposite microbial abundances, although their gingerspecies were the same. Category 3 results (Fig. 5C) showed a similar phenomenon. Theresults of category 4 indicated that the bacterial colony structures of the soil in\nMengzhou (HJ ginger) and non-Mengzhou (PH ginger) regions are very different\n(Fig. 5D). The genetic evolutionary tree line on the left represents the species of bacte-ria (with names on the right) clustered together or classi \ufb01ed in several regions.\nDiversity analyses. To assess the richness and diversity of the soil bacterial com-\nmunity of ginger, we \ufb01rst calculated the values of\na-diversity of the samples using the\nQuantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, v1.9.0) software and three indexesand evaluated the signi \ufb01cant differences between groups (Fig. 6). In the cases of cate-\ngory 1 and category 2 (Fig. 6A and B), the three indexes showed signi \ufb01cant differences\nin diversity between groups ( P,0.05). The other two categorization methods (Fig. 6C\nFIG 5 The genetic evolution analyses of microbial communities by heatmap. (Left) Genetic evolutionary tree lines.

Besides MZSHBC,\nthe diversities in other blank controls were all slightly lower than that in ginger groups\n(although there might be no signi \ufb01cant difference), which was consistent with the\nabove results, also indicating that the growth of ginger plants promoted bacterial di-\nversity. In contrast, between the ginger groups (Fig. 6C), the LZJ group had the highest\na-diversity (although the Pvalue was greater than 0.05), which could be attributed to\nthe ginger and cherry intercropping method (Table 2), which usually promotes\nimproved soil quality and microbial diversity (14, 22).\nTo further compare the b-diversities between multiple groups, i.e., to examine the\ncategorization method effects using OTU data, we performed two statistical methods,\nPCA and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) (Fig. 7). The results of category 1are used as examples here. As shown in the PCA plot (Fig. 7A), the aggregation effect\nof samples from the same region was evident. The clustering ellipses of the regional\nsamples did not exhibit any overlap. For instance, although MZST and MZSH samples\nwere collected from different sites (2 to 3 km apart), they were clustered together\n(Fig. 7A, upper left) because they belonged to the same region (Gudan township of\nMengzhou city). The samples from the Zhangliang region clustered together at the\nright of Fig. 7A and those of the Liuzhai region at the bottom left. The Pvalues\nbetween the groups were signi \ufb01cant ( P,0.001) in both PC1 and PC2 dimensions. In\naddition, the separation effect between the groups was satisfactory.\nIn addition, NMDS analyses results showed similar clustering and separation\neffects (Fig. 7B). The similarity in the microbial communities within one group(from the same region) was high, and the differences between the groups (from\ndifferent regions) were also obvious. Also, the analyses of similarities (ANOSIM)\n(Fig. 7C, R=0 . 3 8 3 .0a n d P= 0.001) suggested that the differences between the\ngroups were greater than the differences within the groups. Besides, the ANOSIM\nresults also indicate that the categorization method of the samples based on\nregion is meaningful and appropriate.\nFIG 6 a-Diversity analyses by box plots. Three indexes were used to evaluate a-diversity: Shannon entropy, Simpson index, and Chao index (from top to\nbottom). (A) The \ufb01rst categorization was based on ginger and control groups.

Flavobacterium can be used as a\nmarker of the Mengzhou region (Fig. 8D, P= 0.01654). \u201cCandidatus Koribacter \u201d(Fig. 8B,\nP= 0.00145), \u201cCandidatus Solibacter \u201d(Fig. 8C, P= 0.02506), and Geobacter (Fig. 8L, P=\n0.01047) can be used as regional markers of the Zhangliang region. In addition, the rel-ative abundances of Plesiocystis (Fig. 8M, P= 0.02889), Aquicella (Fig. 8N, P= 0.02842),\nand Pseudomonas (Fig. 8O, P= 0.00408) also differed signi \ufb01cantly between the groups.\nNo obvious markers were found for the soil bacterial community in the Liuzhai region.\nSubsequently, we used a selection of species markers using the linear discriminant\nanalysis effect size (LEfSe) method (based on linear discriminant analysis) and theGraPhlan method (sample community distribution map of species evolutionary tree [datanot shown]). The LEfSe analyses combine linear discriminant analyses with nonparametricKruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to screen for biomarkers (species that differsigni\ufb01cantly between groups) between groups. The results of this analysis of dominant\nspecies (interspeci \ufb01c markers) were slightly different from those of box line plots, but\nthere was some correlation.\nConsistent with the above results, Alicyclobacillus ,Bacillus ,Phenylobacterium ,Devosia ,\nBurkholderia ,a n d Bdellovibrio were also classi \ufb01ed as ZLBC markers (see Fig. S3 in the sup-\nplemental material). Compared to the box plot (Fig. 8D), Flavobacterium was further classi-\n\ufb01ed as a marker of the MZJST group (Fig. S3). \u201cCandidatus Nitrososphaera \u201dwas further\nclassi \ufb01ed as a marker of the MZJSH group. Furthermore, the LEfSe analyses present the re-\nspective intergroup markers for the ZLJ and LZJ groups (not given in the box plotsabove). Elusimicrobia was classi \ufb01ed as a marker of the ZLJ group, and\nActinomycetospora\nas a marker of the LZJ group (Fig. S3).\nPrediction of the metabolic function of bacteria. To predict the metabolic func-\ntions of the bacterial communities, based on BugBase software, we performed a com-parison of phenotypic classi \ufb01cations between groups, including Gram positivity, Gram\nnegativity, bio \ufb01lm formation, pathogenicity, mobile components, oxygen demand\n(including anaerobic, aerobic, and parthenogenic bacteria), and oxidative stress toler-ance (seven categories), taking only the \ufb01rst category method as the example (Fig. S4).\nAs shown, there existed signi \ufb01cant differences between groups of aerobic (Fig. S4A),\nGram-negative (Fig. S4F), Gram-positive (Fig. S4G), and stress-tolerant (Fig. S4I) bacteria ( P,\n0.01). In particular, the relative abundance of the bacterium in the ZLJ and ZLBC groupsshowed signi \ufb01cant differences from others. This result indicates that after \ufb02ooding and soak-\ning, the soil bacteria in the Zhangliang region suffered from a more complex soil environment\nthan other groups, requiring more aerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria to maintain the meta-bolic cycle of vital elements and the nutritional requirements of the ginger plants. This is con-sistent with the Zhangliang region suffering from more severe \ufb02ooding than other regions.\nDISCUSSION\nThe bacterial diversity of the soil was restored with timely drainage 2 months after the\n\ufb02ooding and inundation on 20 July 2021 (15). In this study, we used 16S rRNA high-\nthroughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to compare the bacterial community\nstructures of characteristic ginger soils from three regions in the Henan Province of north-central China. The species of the top 10 bacterial phyla showed high similarity with thosepreviously reported (13), but each accounted for different percentages. With probably themost severe \ufb02ooding, the Zhangliang region \u2019s bacterial community structures differed sig-\nni\ufb01cantly from others. The bacterial diversity in Zhangliang was relatively lower than\nothers, although the \ufb02ooding promoted the propagation of eutrophic bacteria. The lands\nof the Zhangliang region may also be contaminated by PAHs or heavy metals, indicating\nthat the effect of \ufb02ood soaking on soil microorganisms is twofold. Importantly, the\nsampled lands of the Zhangliang region require improved management in the future.\nPCA showed that the sampling location had the greatest in \ufb02uence on the soil bac-\nterial community characteristics, and the soil bacterial community structure was mostGinger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum\nMarch/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 11\nsimilar when sampled from the same region. In this study, although the soil types of\nMZST (sandy soils) and MZSH (combination) regions were different, their PCA clustered\nthem together. Meanwhile, although the ginger types of ZLJ and LZJ were the same,\ntheir PCA results were distinguishing. This result shows that the structure of the soilbacterial community is mainly determined by the geographical location of the sample(23) and its associated climate, environment, and farming practices, and not mainly bythe ginger variety. In other words, geographical location in \ufb02uenced the microbial popu-\nlations more than did soil type or ginger variety, consistent with a previous study (23).\nAlthough the Zhangliang region had the lowest bacterial diversity, the number of\nunique OTUs was the highest. According to the investigation, the ZLJ group had a large\nplanting region ( ;1k m\n2) and inadequate drainage and was most severely affected by\n\ufb02ooding; there may be a compensatory increase in aerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria.\nThis suggests that some OTUs may not be ginger soil-speci \ufb01c microorganisms in the\nregion but are present due to the \ufb02ooding. In contrast, Mengzhou had a smaller cultiva-\ntion region (0.005 km2), drained more rapidly, and was less affected; hence, the unique\nOTUs in the region may be the microorganisms speci \ufb01ct ot h i sr e g i o n .\nThe unique OTU analyses may also help enhance the brand characteristics of ancient\nHJ ginger, thereby improving its brand value. In conclusion, these \ufb01ndings help us under-\nstand the species and composition of bacteria (3, 7) and infection of ginger soil after\ufb02ooding and soaking. They also guide the signi \ufb01cance of conserving ancient characteris-\ntic ginger varieties and enhancing biological control of plant bacterial diseases (3, 13).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSample information. Two ginger species, PH and HJ, were planted in three types of soil: sandy, red\nclay, and combination (dark loessal and sandy soils) in three cities of Henan province, China. In total, fourginger (J, short for \u201cjiang \u201din Chinese) groups were set up with their corresponding blank controls (blank\nsoil in nearby \ufb01eld paths with no crops), each group with four samples, totaling 32 samples (Table 2). They\nwere named ZLJ01-04, ZLBC01-04, MZJST01-04, MZSTBC01-04, MZJSH01-04, MZSHBC01-04, LZJ01-04, andLZBC01-04. The experimental group was sampled in the ginger planting region; the blank group wassampled in the adjacent nonplanting region (Table 2). When sampling, we \ufb01rst removed the surface \ufb02oat-\ning soil and dug the subsurface 15-cm layer of soil using an ethanol-sterilized \ufb01re shovel. After removing\nvisible impurities, each sample group was collected from the four sites, and an appropriate amount of soilsamples was loaded in sterile 2.0-mL centrifuge tubes, each tube accommodating approximately 300 mg.Then, they were immediately kept at 280\u00b0C or on dry ice for cryopreservation and transportation.\nSoil bacterial gDNA extraction and 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. Total genomic DNA (gDNA) of bac-\nterial soil samples was extracted using the gDNA isolation kit (TianGen, Beijing, China) according to themanufacturer \u2019s instructions. The quality and quantity of extracted gDNA were determined using agarose\ngel electrophoresis and Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scienti \ufb01c, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively. The\ngDNA was stored at 220\u00b0C before further assessment.\nThe PCR ampli \ufb01cation of the bacterial V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes was performed using the upstream\nprimer 5 9-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3 9and the downstream primer 5 9-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3 9.I n\norder to differentiate the sample, the speci \ufb01c paired-end (PE) barcode (6 bp) was fused into the TruSeq\nadaptor for high-throughput sequencing. The ampli \ufb01cation reaction system (total, 50\nmL) contained 25 mL\nPhusion high- \ufb01delity master mix, 3 mL( 1 0mM) each primer, 10 mL gDNA (as the template), 3 mLd i m e t h y l\nsulfoxide, and 6 mL double-distilled water (ddH2O). The PCR cycle comprised initial denaturation (98\u00b0C for\n30 s), followed by 26 cycles of denaturation (98\u00b0C for 15 s), annealing (58\u00b0C for 15 s), and extension (72\u00b0Cfor 15 s), with a \ufb01nal extension (72\u00b0C for 60 s). The ;450-bp PCR products were puri \ufb01ed using AMPure XP\nbeads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and quanti \ufb01ed by the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Life\nTechnologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). After quanti \ufb01cation, all amplicons were pooled in equal amounts\n(50 ng), and PE 150-bp sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)at GUHE Info Technology Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China).\nData analyses. We utilized QIIME software to process the sequencing reads, as previously reported\n(24). In brief, the raw reads that matched the barcodes were assigned to each soil sample and further iden-ti\ufb01ed as valid data. Besides, low-quality reads with average Phred scores of ,20,,151-bp lengths, ambig-\nuous bases, and mononucleotide repeats of .8b pw e r e \ufb01ltered out (25, 26). The PE reads were merged\nby overlap, and OTUs were picked using Vsearch v2.4.4 (--fastq_mergepairs \u2013fastq_minovlen 5) (27), which\nincluded cluster (--cluster_fast, \u2013id 0.97), dereplication (--derep_fulllength), and detection of chimeras\n(--uchime_ref). Next, we selected a representative sequence from each OTU using the default parametersand used Vsearch to search the Greengenes database for representative sequences for OTU classi \ufb01cation.\nA table recording the taxonomy and abundance of each OTU for each sample was created. OTUs\nwith an ,0.001% abundance of total sequences across all samples were discarded. To minimize the vari-\nation in sequencing depth across samples, an averaged, rounded rare \ufb01ed OTU table was also generated\nby averaging a subset of 100 uniformly resampled OTUs below 90% of the minimum sequencing depthfor further analyses.Ginger Soil Bacterial Colony Analysis after a Flood Microbiology Spectrum\nMarch/April 2023 Volume 11 Issue 2 10.1128/spectrum.04355-22 12\nBioinformatics. The bioinformatics analyses of the sequencing reads were mainly performed using\nR packages (v3.2.0) and QIIME. a-Diversity indexes based on OTU level, including the Shannon diversity\nindex, Chao1 richness estimator, and Simpson index, were calculated using the OTU table in QIIME. The\nranked abundance curves based on OTU level were generated to compare the richness and evenness of\nOTUs between groups.\nThe structural variations of microbial communities between groups were also investigated by b-diver-\nsity analyses based on OTU level, using UniFrac distance metrics (28, 29) and nonmetric multidimensionalscaling (NMDS) (30). PCA was also performed based on the genus-level compositional pro \ufb01les (30). The sig-\nni\ufb01cance of structural differentiation of bacterial communities between groups was evaluated by permuta-\ntional multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using the R package \u201cVegan \u201d(31). Venn diagrams\nwere generated using the R package \u201cVenn Diagram \u201dto visualize shared and unique OTUs between\ngroups, based on the occurrence of OTUs between groups, regardless of their relative abundance (32).\nTaxon abundances (on the phylum and genus levels) were statistically compared between groups\nusing the Kruskal test in the R statistical package. Linear discriminant analysis effect sizes (LEfSes) were\nperformed to detect taxa with different abundances between groups using default parameters (33).\nThen, we applied random forest analyses to distinguish the different samples and groups using the Rpackage \u201crandomForest \u201dwith 1,000 trees, with all the settings at the default (34). The generalization\nerror was estimated using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The expected \u201cbaseline \u201derror was also\nincluded, obtained from the classi \ufb01er that predicts the most common category label. Cooccurrence analyses\nwere performed by calculating Spearman \u2019s rank correlations between predominant taxa. Meanwhile, corre-\nlations with jRHO jof.0.6 and a Pvalue of ,0.01 were visualized as cooccurrence networks using\nCytoscape (35). We had predicted microbial functions by phylogenetic investigation of communities by\nreconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) based on high-quality reads (36). Besides, we had used thestatistical analysis of metagenomic pro \ufb01les (STAMP) software package v2.1.3 for further analyses of the out-\nput\ufb01les (37). BugBase is an excellent software program for the measurement of high-level phenotypes\nwithin the microbiome (38). FAPROTAX is a data bank that maps prokaryotic clades (e.g., genera or species)to establish metabolic or other ecologically relevant functions (39).\nEthics approval and consent to participate.
