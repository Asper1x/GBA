A similar feature was described in athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which complicatesthe diagnosis for clinicians. In this context, we aimed to compare the LV function of the 2 populations by measuring global and regional strain\nand myocardial work using speckle-tracking imaging.\nMethods : Twenty-four strength-trained asymptomatic athletes using AAS (AAS-Athletes), 22 athletes diagnosed with HCM (HCM-Athletes),\nand 20 healthy control athletes (Ctrl-Athletes) underwent a resting echocardiography to assess LV function. We evaluated LV global andregional strains and myocardial work, with an evaluation of the constructive work (CW), wasted work, and work ef\ufb01ciency (WE).\nResults : Compared to Ctrl-Athletes, both AAS-Athletes and HCM-Athletes had a thicker interventricular septum, with majored values in HCM-Athletes.\nLV strain was reduced in AAS-Athletes and even more in HCM-Athletes. Consequently, global WE was signi\ufb01cantly diminished in both AASand HCM-Athletes (93% \u00a72% in Ctrl-Athletes, 90% \u00a74% in AAS-Athletes, and 90% \u00a75% in HCM-Athletes (mean \u00a7SD); p<0.05).\nConstructive work and WE regional analysis showed speci\ufb01c alterations, with the basal septal segments preferentially affected in AAS-Athletes,\nand both septal and apical segments affected in HCM-Athletes.Conclusion : The regional evaluation of myocardial work reported speci\ufb01c alterations of the major LV hypertrophy induced by the regular use of\nAAS compared to the LV hypertrophy due to HCM. This \ufb01nding could help clinicians to differentiate between these 2 forms of pathological\nhypertrophy.\nTaggedPKeywords: Anabolic androgenic steroids; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Left ventricular function; Myocardial work; Speckle-tracking echocardiography TaggedEnd\nTaggedH11.

Sudden cardiac death represents the most devas-\ntating presenting manifestati on, especially in young patients. TaggedEnd\nTaggedPThe purpose of the present study was to compare the regional\nfunction of pathological hypertrophy of strength-trained athletesreporting long-term and regular use of AAS with that ofathletes diagnosed with HCM. They were compared withhealthy highly-trained athletes with physiological LV hyper-trophy. Importantly, recent development of echocardiography\nproposes to evaluate myocardial work as an innovative and\nnon-invasive method for measuring myocardial performance.It requires a combination of longitudinal strain and non-invasive blood pressure measurements to obtain pressure /C0\nstrain loops during the cardiac cycle,\n20/C022and, thus, represents\na more accurate assessment of myocardial function by consid-ering cardiac afterload.\n22It differentiates myocardial construc-\ntive work (CW) and myocardial wasted work (WW) to\nestimate myocardial work ef\ufb01ciency (WE) and can be assessed\nregionally. We hypothesized that (a) the 2 forms of pathologi-cal remodeling would be associated with a decrease inmyocardial CW and a decrease in myocardial WE, and (b)regional alterations would be different between pathologicalremodeling induced by athletes reporting AAS consumptionand athletes with HCM.

Study populations TaggedEnd\nTaggedPTwenty-four strength-trained asymptomatic athletes\nactively taking AAS (AAS-Athletes), and who were known toparticipate in bodybuilding competitions, were recruited inFrench gymnasiums. The inclusion criteria required a traininghistory of at least 5 h of training per week for a minimum of\n5 years. To be included in this study, AAS-Athletes needed to\nself-report a documented history of AAS use for at least 3courses of 2 weeks in the past 2 years. All were on drugs, i.e .,\nhad administered their last AAS dose during the past 2 days. TaggedEnd\nTaggedPTwenty-two athletes with HCM (HCM-Athletes) were\nretrospectively selected from a large database of the RegionalCompetence Center of Genetic Disease (Rennes Hospital,Rennes, France). We included only asymptomatic athletes\nwith a moderate wall thickness hypertrophy (13 /C020 mm). The\npreliminary cardiac investigations resulting in the diagnosiswere conducted during a period when these athletes were still\nactively engaged in competitive sports and before any decisionregarding disquali\ufb01cation or cessation of exercise. HCM, espe-cially in the case of borderline gray-zone wall thickness(13/C015 mm), was diagnosed in the context of a combination of\nfeatures, including (a) identi\ufb01cation of HCM in a \ufb01rst-degreerelative or an established pathogenic gene mutation; (b)\nnonconcentric patterns of LV hypertrophy (especially apical\nhypertrophy); (c) dynamic LV out\ufb02ow tract obstruction; (d)late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance;or (e) atrial or ventricular arrhythmias.\n3In this group, each\nsubject underwent clinical examination, standard and speckle-tracking 2D-transthoracic echocardiography, late gadoliniumenhancement by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 48-hHolter monitoring, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing to\ndiagnose HCM, according to current guidelines.\n23Exclusion\ncriteria were as follows: obstructive cardiomyopathy at rest,concomitant moderate or severe valvular heart disease,myocardial storage disease, hypertension, coronary arterydisease, or left bundle branch block.

Myocardial work quanti\ufb01cation TaggedEnd\nTaggedPMyocardial work and related parameters were estimated\nusing the Automatic Function Imaging (AFI) of the Echo PACsoftware (Version 203; GE Healthcare). Myocardial work wasestimated as a function of time throughout the cardiac cycle bythe combination of LV strain data (recorded on the apical 4-,3-, and 2-chambers views) obtained by STE and a non-inva-sively estimated LV pressure curve as previously describedand validated.\n20,21,29Peak arterial pressure measured a few\nminutes before the echocardiography with a cuff-manometer\nwas assumed to be equal to peak systolic and diastolic LVpressures and to be uniform throughout the ventricle.\n20\nMyocardial work was then quanti\ufb01ed by calculating the rate ofsegmental shortening by differentiating the strain curve andmultiplying the resulting value by the instantaneous LV pres-sure. The result was integrated over time to obtain myocardialwork as a function of time. TaggedEnd\nTaggedPMyocardial work was calculated from mitral valve closure\nuntil mitral valve opening as previously described.\n22,29The\nwork performed by the myocardium during segmental short-ening represents CW, whereas the work performed by themyocardium during stretch or segmental lengthening repre-sents the energy loss, which is de\ufb01ned as WW. The workperformed by the myocardium during segmental shortening,which does not promote LV relaxation, was considered\nsegmental WW. On the other hand, the work performed by the\nmyocardium during segmental lengthening was consideredsegmental CW.

Indeed,it has been demonstrated that AAS exposure at supraphysio-logic doses stimulates cardiomyocytes hypertrophy.\n30\nHCM-Athletes were retrospectively selected from a large data-base of athletes diagnosed with HCM,\n31from whom we chose\nonly young athletes with moderate wall-thickness hyper-\ntrophy.32Despite these speci\ufb01c inclusion criteria, HCM-\nAthletes exhibited signi\ufb01cantly higher maximum septal thick-ness compared to Ctrl-Athletes and AAS-Athletes.

In HCM-Athletes,\nresults were different because EF remained unchanged and GLSwas reduced\u2014a \ufb01nding that has been frequently observed else-where\n33/C035and that is potentially explained by the compensatory\nincrease of LV circumferential strain in HCM patients, ass u g g e s t e db yS t o k k ee ta l .\n36TaggedEnd\nTaggedPIn the present study, we used the recently developed nonin-\nvasive technique of myocardial work estimation, which inte-\ngrates LV strains and LV intraventricular pressure curves\nduring the cardiac cycle.

Our results indicated that global CW waslower in HCM-Athletes compared to the other groups. GlobalWW seemed slightly higher in AAS-Athletes compared to\nCtrl-Athletes, but the difference failed to reach statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance. As a result, global WE was lower in both AAS-Athletes and HCM-Athletes compared to Ctrl-Athletes. Inathletes using AAS and in patients diagnosed with HCM,previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or post-mortemstudies provided evidence that cardiac remodeling is associ-ated with an increase in myocardial \ufb01brosis,\n7,37which has\nadverse effects on myocyte excitability, cell-to-cell coupling,\nand the regulation of intracellular calcium.

Oursigni\ufb01cant (but moderate) correlation between global WE andSD\n18Ssuggests that an increase in mechanical dispersion could\nbe partly responsible for the lower WE observed in our AAS-and HCM-Athletes. TaggedEnd\nTaggedH24.2. LV regional myocardial work TaggedEnd\nTaggedPWe used a regional analysis of strains and myocardial work,\nwhich might be helpful in identifying the speci\ufb01c differences\nof LV hypertrophy related to AAS consumption or to HCM.\nIndeed, previous studies showed the usefulness of regionalanalysis in diagnosing various pathological conditions inpatients, such as HCM,\n42or in response to cardiac resynchro-\nnization therapy.43LV strains were decreased on 2 segments\nin AAS-Athletes and on 8 segments in HCM-Athletes. Similarresults were observed on TTP strains, since 1 segment wasdelayed in AAS-Athletes and 6 were delayed in HCM-\nAthletes, suggesting that more segments were altered in HCM-\nAthletes than in AAS-Athletes. TaggedEnd\nTaggedPAnalysis of LV peak strains is inherently limited because both\nintra-ventricular pressure and residual myocardial contractionafter ejection are not considered. However, these limitations areovercome with myocardial work analysis.\n21Interestingly, our\nresults strongly supported regional differences between AAS- andHCM-Athletes. In AAS-Athle tes, both CW and WE were signi\ufb01-\ncantly reduced on 3 segments localized at the basal-septal level,\nwhereas in HCM-Athletes they w ere diminished both on apical\nand septal segments, in line with the location of their HCM.Recently, with a concomitant evaluation of myocardial work byechocardiography and of myocardial \ufb01brosis by magnetic reso-nance imaging, Galli et al .\n40showed an association between CW\ndecrease and presence of inters titial \ufb01brosis. Previous post-\nmortem studies reported \ufb01brosis de velopment predominantly situ-\nated on the interventricular septum of AAS-users,7,8which could\nexplain the drop of CW in AAS-users. Furthermore, our bullseyesshowed an increase of myocardial work heterogeneity from Ctrl-Athletes to HCM-Athletes: Ctrl-Athletes exhibited a base-to-apexmyocardial work gradient, which was less present in AAS-Athletes and totally abolished i n HCM-Athletes. Taken together,\nthese results showed that AAS consumption led to speci\ufb01cregional dysfunctions that were di stinct from those observed in\nHCM-Athletes. The evaluation of regional myocardial work, a\nnovel approach to assess the myocardial function, might helpclinicians to distinguish the car diac remodeling of athletes who\nare using AAS from those who are suffering from HCM, incomplement with genetic analysis in selected cases.\n44TaggedEnd\nTaggedH24.3.

Inevitably and for ethical reasons, information about\nthe intake of AAS was self-reported, and the type of drugs and\ndosages differed between athletes. Other studies on strength-trained athletes using AAS are needed, especially to link thedrop in their LV myocardial work with the likely increase inmyocardial \ufb01brosis. Finally, current software for non-invasivemyocardial work assessment does not take myocardial wallthickness and curvature into account. TaggedEnd\nTaggedH15. Conclusion TaggedEnd\nTaggedPBased on myocardial work assessments, our study brings\nadditional evidence of pathological LV remodeling instrength-trained athletes reporting regular use of AAS. Impor-\ntantly, regional analysis of myocardial work highlighted that\ndepressed myocardial function was observed at the basal-septal level in AAS-Athletes, whereas it was observed mainlyat the septal and apical levels in HCM-Athletes. These resultsunderlined the bene\ufb01t of myocardial work analysis comparedto myocardial strain analysis alone. In complement to otherinvestigations (e.g., genetic evaluation), these new parameterscould be useful for the clinician to better distinguish the major\nLV hypertrophy induced by regular use of supraphysiologic\ndoses of AAS from LV hypertrophy due to HCM.
