This prospective non-controlled cohort study included 162 \napparently healthy Caucasian adult volunteers. When PTH was binarized according to the median value, at VMR \nD14.9, 25(OH)D 3 F9.7 ng/mL and 24,25(OH) 2D3 F0.64 ng/mL there was a pronounced relationship between \nPTH and age (p \u00880.001, p \u00880.023 and p \u00880.0134 respectively), with the prevalence of higher PTH levels in \nolder individuals and vice versa. Moreover, at an age of D40.3 years, there was a pronounced relationship be-\ntween PTH and VMR (p D0.001), and similarly at an age of D54.5 years, there was a pronounced relationship \nbetween PTH and 25(OH)D 3 (p \u00880.002) as well as between PTH and 24,25(OH) 2D3 (p \u00880.0038): in younger \npeople, higher PTH values prevailed only in the range of vitamin D insufficiency, while in the older age group \nthis relationship was not demonstrated and PTH values were in general above the median. VMR controlled the \ncorrelation between PTH and age more strongly than metabolites 25(OH)D 3 and 24,25(OH) 2D3 (p \u00880.0012 vs. p \nF0.05 and p \u00880.0385 respectively). The optimal threshold was found equal to 11.7 for VMR such that the \nrelationship between PTH and age in the subset of participants with VMR D11.7 was characterized by a cor-\nrelation coefficient of \u03c1 \u00880.68 (p D0.001), while the cohort with VMR F11.7 was characterized by a very weak \ncorrelation coefficient of \u03c1 \u00880.12 (p \u00880.218), which is non-significant. In summary, our findings suggest that \nthe relationship between PTH and vitamin D is age-dependent, with a greater susceptibility to elevated PTH \namong older individuals even with preserved renal function, likely due to the resistance to vitamin D function. \nWe propose VMR can be considered as a potential marker of vitamin D status. These findings require confir -\nmation in larger population-based studies.\n1.Introduction\nThe main biological role of vitamin D is the absorption of dietary \ncalcium. One of the most commonly used criteria in determining vitamin \nD sufficiency is the suppression of the excess parathyroid hormone \n(PTH) secretion, since the increase in PTH concentration reflects compensation for the inadequate absorption of calcium in the intestine \nin the state of vitamin D insufficiency. Conventionally, the main circu-\nlating vitamin D metabolite 25(OH)D is used for this assessment, how-\never, the cut-off data for this parameter vary widely in the literature (Sai \net al., 2011 ). The role of other metabolites as markers of vitamin D status \nis actively debated, but their relationship with PTH has been studied to a \n*Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: jukov.artem@endocrincentr.ru (A.

In severe vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25(OH)D D10 ng/ \nmL), the concentration of 24,25(OH) 2D becomes undetectable \n(Kaufmann et al., 2014 ), while a significant decrease in the percentage \nof individuals with 24,25(OH) 2D levels below the detection threshold is \nobserved with 25(OH)D values F20 ng/mL (Cavalier et al., 2020 ).\nIt should be noted that very low serum concentrations of 24,25 \n(OH) 2D may be observed due to a number of reasons, among which the \ndifferential diagnosis between vitamin D deficiency and an inactivating \nmutation of CYP24A1 (the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 24,25 \n(OH) 2D from 25(OH)D). To solve this problem, the calculation of the \nratio of vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D/24,25(OH) 2D, vitamin D \nmetabolite ratio, VMR) is proposed. Under normal conditions VMR is \ninversely correlated with 25(OH)D and is described by an exponential \nrelationship, while 24,25(OH) 2D has a strong positive correlation and \nlinear relationship with 25(OH)D (Jones and Kaufmann, 2021 ).\nThe relationship between vitamin D and PTH may be influenced by \nvarious external and internal factors, with age being one of the promi -\nnent candidates. Older age is widely considered to be a risk factor for \nvitamin D deficiency (Holick et al., 2011 ; Dedov et al., 2021 ), which is \nexplained primarily by decreased cutaneous synthesis (Wacker and \nHolick, 2013 ). On the other hand, a decrease in renal function, being \ncommon in older people, leads to a decrease in the synthesis of 1,25 \n(OH) 2D and the consumption of 25(OH)D correspondingly (Dusso et al., \n2011 ). In addition, it has long been established that calcium absorption \ndecreases with age (Nordin et al., 1970 ). Some previously conducted \nstudies aimed at clarifying the effect of age on the relationship between \nPTH and vitamin D, but they were mainly focused on 25(OH)D and 1,25 \n(OH) 2D (Vieth et al., 2003 ; Valcour et al., 2012 ).\nThe aim of this study was to assess the relationship between PTH, age \nand parameters characterizing vitamin D status (both \u201cclassical \u201d \u2013 25 \n(OH)D 3, and \u201cnon-classical \u201d \u2013 24,25(OH) 2D3 and VMR).\n2.Materials and methods\n2.1. Study population and design\nThis was a prospective non-controlled cohort study. The study group \nincluded 162 apparently healthy Caucasian adult volunteers without a \nhistory of metabolic skeletal diseases (including osteoporosis) or disor -\nders of calcium \u2011phosphorus homeostasis. The exclusion criteria were: \nvitamin D supplementation or therapy that is presumably associated \nwith alterations in vitamin D metabolism in the three month period prior \nto the study; severe obesity (body mass index (BMI) F35 kg/m2); \npregnancy; the presence of granulomatous disease, malabsorption syn-\ndrome, liver failure, or chronic kidney disease. All participants were \nrecruited in the period from July 2019 to June 2023. Serum samples \nwere either transferred directly to the laboratory for biochemical ana-\nlyzes and PTH measurement or were stored at \u000080 \u2022C avoiding repeated \nfreeze-thaw cycles for measurement of vitamin D metabolites at a later \ndate. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of \nEndocrinology Research Centre, Moscow, Russia, on April 10, 2019 \n(abstract of record No. 6), all participants signed an informed consent to \nparticipate in the study.\n2.2. Laboratory measurements\nThe serum vitamin D metabolites levels (25(OH)D 3, 25(OH)D 2 and \n24,25(OH) 2D3) were determined by ultra-high performance liquid \nchromatography in combination with tandem mass spectrometry \n(UPLC-MS/MS) using an in-house developed method, described earlier for 2019 \u20132022 (Povaliaeva et al., 2020 ) and 2022 \u20132023 (Zhukov et al., \n2022 ; Usoltseva et al., 2023 ). With this technique, the laboratory par-\nticipates in the DEQAS quality assurance program (lab code 2388) and \nthe results fall within the target range for the analysis of 25(OH)D and \n1,25(OH) 2D metabolites in human serum. Proficiency certificates for the \ndetermination of 25(OH)D were issued annually from 2020 to 2024.\nPTH levels were evaluated by electrochemiluminescence immuno -\nassay (ELECSYS, Roche, Switzerland; reference range for this and sub-\nsequent laboratory parameters are given in the Results section for easier \nreading). Biochemical parameters of blood serum were assessed by \nARCHITECT c8000 analyzer (Abbott, Illinois, United States) using re-\nagents from the same manufacturer according to standard methods. \nCalibration and quality control were performed in accordance with the \nmanufacturers \u2019 recommendations.\n2.3. Other measurements\nAt the baseline visit, participants provided medical history via a \nquestionnaire. Serving of dairy products was defined as 100 g of cottage \ncheese, 200 mL of milk, 125 g of yogurt or 30 g of cheese. Participants \u2019 \nweight was measured in light indoor clothing with a medical scale to the \nnearest 100 g, and their height was measured with a wall-mounted \nstadiometer to the nearest centimeter. Body mass index (BMI) was \ncalculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. \nThe glomerular filtration rate was calculated according to the recom -\nmendations of the NKF-ASN Task Force 2021 (Delgado et al., 2022 ).\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using Statistica version 13.0 \n(StatSoft, Oklahoma, United States), Data Master (Azforus, Moscow, \nRussia) and Python statistics and graphics modules. The statistical \ntechniques were aimed to assess the nonlinear relationship of factors. \nSignificance assessment was based on nonparametric permutation test \nand the Occam \u2019s razor principle. The procedure for statistical calcula -\ntions is described in details in the Appendix. Continuous variables were \nsummarized as median and interquartile range (IQR), binary variables \nwere presented as numbers and percentages. A p-value of D0.05 was \nconsidered statistically significant.\n3.Results\nThe study group consisted predominantly of young women charac -\nterized by a moderately healthy lifestyle and suboptimal calcium intake \n(Table 1).\n25(OH)D 3 levels D20 ng/mL were observed in half of the study \ngroup, and increased PTH was observed in 15 participants (9 %) \n(Table 2). Only one patient had eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (57 \nmL/min/1.73m2, new-onset). We observed no significant alterations in \ncalcium and phosphorus serum levels.\nTable 1 \nGeneral characteristics of the study group.\nParameter Value (n \u0088162)\nAge (years), median (IQR) 26.2 (24.9; 42.5)\nSex (female/male), n (%)125(77 %)/37(23 \n%)\nBMI (kg/m2), median (IQR) 22.5 (20.0; 26.3)\nCurrent smokers, n (%) 26 (16 %)\nFormer smokers, n (%) 21 (13 %)\nDairy products consumption (servings per day), median \n(IQR)1 (1; 2)\nAlcohol consumption (units per week), median (IQR) 0.5 (0; 1)\nExercises lasting F30 min per week, median (IQR) 3 (2; 5)\nNumber of medications, median (IQR) 0 (0; 1)\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; IQR, interquartile range.A.

Bone Reports  22 (2024)  101800  \n2 \nAt the first stage the relationship between PTH and a combination of \nage and vitamin D status was studied using optimal valid partitioning \n(OVP) (Kuznetsova et al., 2014 ) technique described in Appendix. PTH \nwas binarized in the following way: PTH_B \u00880 (lower than median \nvalue) and PTH_B \u00881 (higher than median value). The aim of performed \nOVP analysis was to separate in the best way groups with PTH_B \u00881 and \nPTH_B \u00880 by age and vitamin D status parameters and to evaluate the \nsignificance of this separation. Significance was evaluated using per-\nmutation test (Pesarin and Salmaso, 2010 ) with the number of permu -\ntations equal to 5000 and Occam \u2019s razor principle (Senko et al., 2022 ). \nThe results of this analysis when vitamin D status is described by its \nmetabolites 25(OH)D 3, 24,25(OH) 2D3, as well as VMR are presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, respectively.\nIt is seen from Fig. 1that at 25(OH)D 3 F9.7 ng/mL there was a \npronounced relationship between PTH_B and age. In the cases of age \nD54.5 years (quadrant I), PTH_B \u00880 predominated: 76 cases of PTH_B \n\u00880 versus 44 cases with PTH_B \u00881. In the subset of participants with \nage F54.5 years (quadrant II), cases with PTH_B \u00881 predominated: 21 \ncases of PTH_B \u00881 versus 3 cases with PTH_B \u00880.\nOn the contrary, at an age of D54.5 years there was a pronounced \nrelationship between PTH_B and 25(OH)D 3: in the area of 25(OH)D 3 D\n9.7 (quadrant IV) 14 cases of PTH_B \u00881 versus 2 cases with PTH_B \u00880, \nwhich differed greatly from the proportions in the previously mentioned \nquadrant I.

The technique is discussed in Appendix. All p- \nvalues were calculated using a previously discussed permutation test \nwith 10,000 permutations.\nThe relationship between PTH and age in the entire study group was \ncharacterized by a weak positive correlation (r \u00880.24, p \u00880.0025), as \ndepicted in Fig. 4.Next, PTH and age were considered as Y and X variables.

Bone Reports  22 (2024)  101800  \n4 \ndependence between PTH and age in the sub-set of 52 cases with VMR D\n11.7 is seen from Fig. 5.\nIn Fig. 6, there is no significant association between age and PTH in \nthe sub-set of 110 cases with VMR F11.7.\n4.Discussion\nThis is an exploratory study aimed at the principles of the relation -\nship between PTH and vitamin D. The results suggest that at higher \nvalues of 24,25(OH) 2D3 and lower values of VMR (which includes the \nrange of vitamin D sufficiency), there was an association between PTH \nand age such that higher PTH values predominated in older individuals \nand vice versa. With values of 24,25(OH) 2D3 and VMR in the opposite \nrange of the axis (including severe vitamin D deficiency), such a rela-\ntionship was absent and PTH values above the median predominated at \nall ages. These findings are supported by the similar pattern observed for \nthe conventional metabolite defining vitamin D status \u2013 25(OH)D 3. \nMoreover, the influence of age was noted when analyzing the relation -\nship between PTH and parameters of vitamin D metabolism: in younger \npeople, higher PTH values prevailed only in the range of vitamin D \ninsufficiency, while in the older age subgroups this relationship was not \ndemonstrated and PTH values were in general above the median.\nFurthermore, we have demonstrated a different nature of the rela-\ntionship between PTH and age at VMR values less and more than the \nobtained \u201ccut-off point \u201d, which is close to the lower quartile. With VMR \nvalues D11.7 (characteristic of the normal range of 25(OH)D 3 values \nand vitamin D sufficiency respectively), older patients were character -\nized by higher PTH values. This is consistent with the literature showing \nthat older individuals have higher PTH levels than younger individuals \neven with comparable 25(OH)D levels (Vieth et al., 2003 ; Valcour et al., \n2012 ). Our results, along with previous work by other groups, may \nindicate the need to consider age as an independent risk factor for sec-\nondary hyperparathyroidism, and also serve as confirmation of existing \nrecommendations for higher vitamin D intake in older adults (Holick \net al., 2011 ), as preventing PTH increase in them may require higher \nlevels of vitamin D. It should be noted that at higher VMR values, which \ninclude the range of vitamin D deficiency, no association of PTH and age \nwas noted, indicating a more complex regulation of PTH production in \nthese conditions. Interestingly, VMR controlled the correlation between \nPTH and age more strongly than metabolites 25(OH)D 3 and 24,25 \n(OH) 2D3, which strengthens its high potential as a marker of vitamin D \nstatus.\nIt might be assumed that the increased impact of the vitamin D status on serum PTH levels in older populations may reflect decreased calcium \nabsorption and/or renal function observed with age. It seems unlikely to \nus that the results we observed could be associated with reduced pro-\nduction of the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2D3, since the included in-\ndividuals had preserved renal function, while the production of 1,25 \n(OH) 2D3 appears to be determined primarily by the functional state of \nthe kidneys, and not by the increasing age itself (Vieth et al., 2003 ). The \nhypothesis of relative resistance to the action of 1,25(OH) 2D3 in older \nindividuals seems more likely to apply (Eastell et al., 1991 ; Patta -\nnaungkul et al., 2015 ).\nOur cohort was relatively small with a predominance of young \npeople, and therefore it seems not feasible to project the obtained results \nto the general population. In addition, it was characterized by subopti -\nmal dietary calcium intake, which may have affected the results. Other \nlimitations of the study include the following: key parameters of cal-\ncium\u2011phosphorus homeostasis (1,25(OH) 2D, fibroblast growth factor- \n23, ionized calcium, magnesium) were not taken into account; a single \nmeasure of PTH is not optimal due to biologic variation especially in this \npopulation with suboptimal calcium intake; and the participants were \nnot screened for other abnormalities (such as elevated serum trans -\naminase, hyperglycemia, clotting factor, low BMD, etc). However, our \ndata provide an important direction for future research, since an \nelevated PTH is associated with both bone health deterioration (Sahota \net al., 2001 ; Sahota et al., 2004 ; Qu et al., 2020 ) and non-skeletal con-\nsequences (Yang et al., 2016 ; Anderson et al., 2011 ; Grandi et al., 2011 ; \nWu et al., 2023 ) even out of context of primary hyperparathyroidism. A \nbetter understanding of the dynamics of the relationship between PTH \nand vitamin D and the factors influencing this relationship is an \nimportant step towards improving clinical approaches.\n5.Conclusions\nThe relationship between PTH and vitamin D is age-dependent, with \na greater susceptibility to elevated PTH among older individuals even \nwith preserved renal function, likely due to resistance to vitamin D \nfunction. Interestingly, VMR controlled the correlation between PTH \nand age more strongly than metabolites 25(OH)D 3 and 24,25(OH) 2D3, \nwhich strengthens its high potential as a marker of vitamin D status. The \nfindings require confirmation in larger population-based studies.\nFunding\nThis research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation, grant \nnumber 19-15-00243-P.\nFig. 5.The relationship between PTH and age in the subset of participants with \nVMR D11.7 (n \u008852) was characterized by a correlation coefficient of \u03c1 \u00880.68, \nwhich is significant at the p D0.001 level according to the standard Stu-\ndent \u2019s test.\nFig. 6.The relationship between PTH and age in the subset of participants with \nVMR F11.7 (n \u0088110) was characterized by a very weak correlation coefficient \nof \u03c1 \u00880.12 (p \u00880.218), which is non-significant.A.

Optimal partitioning method\nThe goal is to assess dependence of binary Y\u2203\u22940C1\u2293on explanatory variables X\u02b9 and X}by dataset S\u0088}\n\u0085y1Cx\u02b91Cx}1\u0086C\u2026C\u0000\nymCx\u02b9mCx}m)\u3008\nBThe \nsearch for optimal partitions presented in the Figs. 1\u20133is carried out by dataset within a family of partitions of the ranges of values of two explanatory \nvariables into four subareas (quadrants) using boundaries parallel to the coordinate axes. The goal is to find partition that in the best way separates \ntwo compared groups. The quality of partition with k quadrants q1C\u2026Cqk is described by functional Q\u0085S\u0086\u0088\u22c3k\ni\u00881\u0085\u03bdi\u0000\u03bd0\u00862mi, where \u03bd0 is fraction of \nobjects with yj\u00881 from dataset SC\u03bdi is fraction of objects with yj\u00881 from dataset S inside quadrant qi, ml is number of objects 1 from dataset S inside \nquadrant qi. So the search of partition where Q\u0085S\u0086is maximal is implemented. Let b\u02b9o, b}o are boundaries for variables X\u02b9 and X}and Qm\u0085S\u0086is Q\u0085S\u0086value \nfor optimal partition. Statistical significance of found in such a way regularities is assessed using a permutation test and variant of Occam \u2019s razor \nprinciple (Senko et al., 2022 ) stating that more complicated may be used only if it allows reject null hypothesis about exhaustive description of studied \ndependence by simple model. Statistical significance of contributions of X\u02b9 and X}to two-dimensional regularity are evaluated separately. To evaluate \nstatistical significance of X\u02b9 contribution null hypothesis H\u201d0 that dependence Y from X\u02b9 and X}is exhaustively described by one variable X}only. In \nother words, H}0 assumes independence of Y from X\u02b9 and X}inside segments to the left and to the right of boundary b\u02b9o. Evaluating of statistical \nsignificance of X\u02b9 contribution is reduced to testing of null hypothesis H\u02b90 that Y is independent from X\u02b9 and X}inside segments to the left and to the \nright of boundary b}o. Let \u221al\u0088\u2294l1C\u2026Clml\u2293\u0438 \u221ar\u0088\u2294r1C\u2026Crmr\u2293are the numbers of objects with X}Db}o and X}Fb}o respectively.

Influence of the third factor on the correlation of two variables\nThe technique is based on well-known permutation test (Pesarin and Salmaso, 2010 ). Groups are formed according to a simple rule with threshold \n\u03b4: object is put to left group if ZD\u03b4 and object is put to right group if ZF\u03b4. The optimal threshold \u03b4 is searched through maximizing the special \nfunctional q. The assessment of the statistical significance of the effect associated with the difference in correlations in the left and right groups is based \non an attempt to refute each of the three null hypotheses Hy\n0, Hx\n0 and Hz\n0: Hy\n0 assumes the independence of Y on combination of X and Z; Hx\n0 assumes the \nindependence of X on combination of Y and Z; Hz\n0 assumes the independence of Z on combination of X and Y. Each hypothesis is tested by comparing \ntest statistic F at initial dataset S with F value at random samples Sr\n1C\u2026CSr\nN which are generated from initial dataset S by random permutations of one of \nthe three variables XCYand Z relative to the fixed positions of the other two variables. To reject or accept Hx\n0, a set of random permutations \u2294f1C\u2026CfN\u2293\nof natural numbers from the set \u22941C\u2026Cm\u2293is calculated using a random number generator.

To test null hypotheses HY\n0 and Hz\n0 p-values py and pzare calculated in the same way as px but by permuting Y and Z instead of \npermuting X. Our previous studies have shown that the greatest effectiveness of the criterion is achieved when using test statistic based on the well- \nknown Fisher \u2019s z-transform, first proposed by him back in 1915. The reasons for using the criterion presented below are discussed in detail in (Mazilina \net al., 2021 ). Suppose that the sample objects to the left and to the right of the boundary \u03b4 for the third factor Z are independently generated from \nbivariate normal distributions with the correlation coefficients between the variables X and Y equal to \u03c1l and \u03c1r, respectively. Suppose that to the left of \nthe boundary \u03b4 there is a subsample Sl of ml objects with the correlation coefficient r\u0085Sl\u0086; to the right of the boundary \u03b4 there is a subsample Sr of mr \nobjects with the correlation coefficient r\u0085Sr\u0086. Fisher \u2019s transformation for the correlation coefficients R\u0085Sl\u0086and R\u0085Sr\u0086are zl\u00881\n2ln[\n1\u0087R\u0085Sl\u0086\n1\u0000R\u0085Sl\u0086]\nand zr\u00881\n2ln \n[\n1\u0087R\u0085Sr\u0086\n1\u0000R\u0085Sr\u0086]\nrespectively. Variables zl and zr are distributed close to normal with means 1\n2ln[\n1\u0087\u03c1l\n1\u0000\u03c1l]\nand 1\n2ln[\n1\u0087\u03c1r\n1\u0000\u03c1r]\nand standard deviations \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aaml\u00003\u2660and \n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aamr\u00003\u2660respectively.

Let pl\u00881\u0000\u03a6\u0085Zl\u0086and pr\u00881\u0000\u03a6\u0085Zr\u0086where \u03a6 is cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. The differences \nbetween the coefficients are described using the statistic q\u0085\u03b4CS\u0086. The search for the optimal value of \u03b4 is carried out within the set B which is subset of \nall unique boundaries from the set \u3009\nzu\n1\u0087zu\n2\n2C\u2026Czu\nm\u00001\u0087zu\nm\n2/\n, where }\nzu\n1C\u2026Czu\nm\u3008\nare variable Z values from S sorted in ascending order. At that \u03b4 is searched for \nwhich q\u0085\u03b4CS\u0086is maximal. Statistic \u0000lnpl\u0087lnprmay be used as q\u0085\u03b4CS\u0086but in this research the better significance was received when \u0085\u03b4CS\u0086\u0088\nmax\u0085\u0000lnplC\u0000lnpr\u0086. Functional F\u0085S\u0086\u0088max\n\u03b4\u03f5Bq\u0085\u03b4CS\u0086is used as statistic of permutation test that is discussed previously. It should be noted that despite the \nuse of the standard normal distribution when constructing test statistics, the null hypotheses Hy\n0, Hx\n0 and Hz\n0 do not contain assumptions about the \nnature of the distributions.\nReferences\nAnderson, J.L., Vanwoerkom, R.C., Horne, B.D., 2011.
