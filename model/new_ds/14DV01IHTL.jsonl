SS predominantly affects women, with a strong genetic component\nlinked to sex chromosomes. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with primary SS (pSS), revealing insights into its\npathogenesis. The adaptive and innate immune systems are crucial to SS\u2019s development, with viral\ninfections implicated as environmental triggers that exacerbate autoimmune responses in genetically\nsusceptible individuals. Moreover, recent research has highlighted the role of vitamin D in modu-\nlating immune responses in pSS patients, suggesting its potential therapeutic implications. In this\nreview, we focus on the recently identified SNPs in genes like OAS1, NUDT15, LINC00243, TNXB,\nand THBS1, which have been associated with increased risks of developing more severe symptoms\nand other diseases such as fatigue, lymphoma, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), dry\neye syndrome (DES), and adverse drug reactions. Future studies should focus on larger, multi-ethnic\ncohorts with standardised protocols to validate findings and identify new associations. Integrating\ngenetic testing into clinical practise holds promise for improving SS management and treatment\nstrategies, enabling personalised interventions based on comprehensive genetic profiles. By focusing\non specific SNPs, vitamin D, and their implications, future research can lead to more effective and\npersonalised approaches for managing pSS and its complications.\nKeywords: autoimmunity; Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome; single-nucleotide polymorphisms; GWASs; lymphoma;\nfatigue\n1. Introduction\nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterised by lympho-\ncytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, leading to dryness of the eyes and mouth, and it is\noften accompanied by systemic manifestations affecting various tissues and organs, such\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics14182035 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 2 of 17\nas arthritis, vasculitis, and interstitial lung disease, and an increased risk of lymphoma, car-\ndiovascular diseases, and cancers [ 1\u20136]. The clinical spectrum of SS is broad, encompassing\nboth primary SS (pSS), in which it occurs alone, and secondary SS (sSS), which develops\nalongside other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic\nlupus erythematosus (SLE) [ 7]. This debilitating condition primarily affects women, with a\nstriking female to male ratio ranging from 9:1 to 14:1 [ 8]. SS is one of the most common\nautoimmune diseases, with an estimated global prevalence of 0.1% to 4.8%, depending on\nthe population studied and diagnostic criteria used [9,10].\nThe pronounced female predominance of SS suggests a strong genetic component\nlinked to sex chromosomes [ 11]. Notably, individuals with Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome (47,XXY),\nwho have an extra X chromosome, exhibit a risk profile similar to females (46,XX), high-\nlighting how the dosage of X chromosome genes affects SS susceptibility [ 12]. Conversely,\nthe coexistence of Turner syndrome (45,X) with SS is exceedingly rare, showing that the\nSS risk in these patients is similar to that of 46,XY males rather than that of 46,XX fe-\nmales [ 13]. Structural chromosomal aberrations affecting X chromosome regions have\nbeen identified in SS patients, suggesting the presence of undefined dosage-sensitive risk\ngenes within these loci [ 14]. Another possible mechanism underlying the effects of the\nX chromosome dose in pSS may be based on the genes escaping X inactivation. As we\nknow, one female X chromosome gene randomly undergoes X-inactivation to achieve equal\ngene expression between XY males and XX females. However, up to 15% of X genes may\nescape that X-inactivation [ 15], thus increasing the gene dose and predisposing women\nand men with more than one X chromosome to differential expression of these genes.\nFurthermore, among many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have been\nidentified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and associated with pSS,\nsome SNPs were believed to act in a sex-specific way. There is no difference in the frequency\nof pSS-associated SNPs between women and men in the general population, but there is a\nmuch higher likelihood of pSS development in women carrying certain SNPs, which can\naffect the expression of genes in pSS-associated regions [16,17].\nHuman leukocyte antigen (HLA ) genes, particularly HLA class II genes (such as HLA-\nDRand HLA-DQ ), play a critical role in SS pathogenesis by presenting self-antigens to T\ncells and triggering autoantibody production [ 18]. Specific HLA alleles, including HLA-\nDRB1*15:01 and HLA-DRB1*03:01 , have consistently been associated with an increased\nrisk of SS across different populations [ 19\u201321]. These alleles contribute to the formation of\nautoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and La (SSB) antigens, which are serological hallmarks of\nthe disease and are important for clinical diagnosis [22].\nDysregulation of both adaptive and innate immune responses is central to SS\u2019s patho-\ngenesis. The adaptive immune system, comprising B and T lymphocytes, plays a pivotal\nrole in SS through aberrant activation and differentiation [ 23]. CD4+ T cells, particularly\nTh1 and Th17 subsets, are prominently involved in the inflammatory cascade, secreting\npro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon-gamma (IFN \u03b3)\nthat contribute to tissue damage [ 24]. B cells in pSS patients produce autoantibodies that\ntarget nuclear antigens, further perpetuating immune-mediated destruction of exocrine\nglands and systemic inflammation [ 25]. Innate immune responses, mediated by pattern\nrecognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), initiate the inflammatory\ncascade upon recognition of microbial components or endogenous danger signals [ 26,27].\nViral infections, particularly those with tropism for salivary and lacrimal glands, have been\nimplicated as environmental triggers in pSS, inducing chronic activation of innate immune\npathways and exacerbating autoimmune responses [28]. This sustained inflammatory mi-\nlieu perpetuates glandular destruction and amplifies systemic manifestations in susceptible\nindividuals [29].\nRecent advancements in genomic technologies have facilitated the identification of\nmultiple SNPs associated with SS susceptibility. These SNPs often reside within genes that\nare involved in immune regulation, cellular signalling pathways, and cytokine production,\noffering mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis [ 20,21]. For instance, the association\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 3 of 17\nwith pSS susceptibility was defined in recent meta-analysis papers for a low copy number of\nFc Fragment Of IgG Receptor IIIb (FCGR3B ) [30],family with sequence similarity 167A-B lymphoid\ntyrosine kinase (FAM167A-BLK ) rs2736340 T allele [ 31],Tumour necrosis factor superfamily\nmember 4 (TNFSF4 ) rs2205960 G>A [ 32],Neutrophil Cytosolic Factor 1 (NCF1 ) rs201802880\n(Arg90His hypoactive variant) [ 33], CGGGG indel polymorphism in the Interferon Regulatory\nFactor 5 (IRF5 ) [34], and B cell activating factor (BAFF ) (rs12583006 T>A) AA genotype [35].\nBesides genetic factors, the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA\nmethylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, has been extensively studied,\nand antigen presentation, lymphocyte regulation, Toll-like receptor, and interferon sig-\nnalling have been suggested as the most relevant therapeutic targets. These topics were\nrecently reviewed in some excellent published papers and will be omitted here [22,36].\nDespite the significant progress that has been made in understanding the genetic\nand immunological underpinnings of pSS, challenges remain when it comes to translating\nthese insights into clinical practice. The clinical heterogeneity of SS necessitates person-\nalised approaches to its diagnosis, management, and treatment [ 37]. Biomarkers derived\nfrom genetic and omics studies, including SNPs associated with disease susceptibility,\nhold promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and predicting disease progression in\npSS patients. Thus, increased signalling potentials in peripheral B cells through STAT3\nS727 and NF- \u03baB pathways were found to correlate with a type I IFN signature of pSS\npatients, suggesting that there are significant potential benefits of therapies targeting these\npathways [ 38]. In another study, while anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB were present in all\npSS patients, three distinctive molecular phenotypes were identified: (1) no significant\nelevation of IFN or inflammation modules; (2) strong IFN and inflammation modular\nnetwork signatures and high plasma protein levels of CXC Motif Chemokine Ligand 9 and\n10 (CXCL9/10), BAFF and tumour necrosis factor superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14 or\nLIGHT); and 3) moderately elevated IFN modules, suppressed inflammatory modules, and\nincreased plasma levels of CXCL9/10/13, IL-1a, and IL-21 [39].\nOn the contrary, two distinct subtypes of pSS have been identified in another study,\nwhich was based on the presence/absence of SSA/SSB antibodies and SNPs. Therefore,\nthe first high-pSS-risk group was associated with the presence of SSA/SSB antibodies and\nHLA-DQA1 rs6933289, IRF5 rs3823536, and Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase 1 (GOT1 )\nrs4919321. Furthermore, the patients of this group displayed a more severe disease pheno-\ntype (increased prevalence of purpura, major salivary gland swelling, lymphadenopathy,\nand lymphoma) compared to the second group, which were SSA-/SSB-negative and had no\nassociated SNPs [ 40]. Finally, INF signatures, SNPs, methylation, flow cytometry analysis\nof alterations in patterns of peripheral blood leukocytes, cytokine analysis, and clinical\nparameters were used in a large cross-sectional cohort study to identify four groups of pa-\ntients with distinct patterns of immune dysregulation. Therefore, 35 SNPs were detected in\ngroup 1, 6 SNPs were detected in group 3, only 1 SNP was detected in group 4, and no SNPs\nwere detected in group 2. Unsurprisingly, most of the SNPs were associated with either\nthe immune system ( HLA-DQB1 ,HLA-DQA1 ,HLA-DRA ,HLA-C ,HLA-G ,Butyrophilin Like\n2(BTNL2 ),HLA Complex Group 23 (HCG23 )), signal transduction ( Neurogenic Locus Notch\nHomolog Protein 4 (NOTCH4 ), developmental biology ( POU Class 5 Homeobox 1 (POU5F1 ),\ngene expression ( DExD-Box Helicase 39B (DDX39B ) or the cell cycle ( Tubulin Beta Class I\n(TUBB ) [41]. Overall, a clear understanding of pSS heterogeneity providing clinically and\nimmunopathologically relevant signatures would help to develop precise and personalised\ntreatment strategies.\nThis review aims to synthesise recent findings on the role of vitamin D in pSS and\nnovel SNPs associated with pSS patients\u2019 susceptibility to more severe pSS symptoms and\nto other diseases (most importantly, lymphoma and fatigue), offering a detailed overview\nof the genetic risk factors and their implications for disease pathogenesis. Because the\nassociation between the HLA -region SNPs and pSS was extensively covered in several\nrecent studies [ 18,20\u201322], we will omit it here. By elucidating the complex interplay between\ngenetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, and environmental triggers, this review\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 4 of 17\nseeks to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and personalised medicine\nstrategies for pSS and associated diseases.\n2. Immunomodulatory Function of Vitamin D\nVitamin D, a steroid hormone vital to calcium homeostasis and bone health, has\nemerged as a pivotal regulator of the immune system. Beyond its classical role in skeletal\nintegrity, extensive research over recent decades has illuminated its potent immunomod-\nulatory properties, implicating it in various facets of immune function and autoimmune\ndiseases [ 42,43]. It was observed to stimulate immune responses, particularly against\ninfectious pathogens like tuberculosis and leprosy [ 44,45]. These findings marked the early\nunderstanding of vitamin D not just as a nutritional factor but also as a hormone with\nprofound effects on the immune system. In particular, vitamin D exerts its immunomod-\nulatory effects through several mechanisms involving both innate and adaptive immune\nresponses (Figure 1). At the level of innate immunity, vitamin D plays a crucial role in\nenhancing antimicrobial peptide production in epithelial cells, such as defensin \u03b22 and\ncathelicidin, which are pivotal in innate defence against invading pathogens [ 46]. In the\nskin, for instance, where vitamin D is synthesised in response to exposure to sunlight, it\npromotes the integrity of the epithelial barrier and assists with local immune responses [ 47].\nMoreover, vitamin D regulates the function of macrophages and monocytes, which are\nkey players in the innate immune system. These cells express vitamin D receptors (VDRs )\nand can produce the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3)\nlocally in response to infections [ 48]. 1,25(OH)2D3 enhances the innate immune response\nby promoting phagocytosis, cytokine production, and antimicrobial peptide synthesis,\ncontributing to pathogen clearance and immune surveillance [49].\nDiagnostics 2024 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  4 of 18  \n of the genetic risk factors and their implications for disease pathogenesis.

Immunomodulatory Function of Vitamin D  \nVitamin D, a steroid hormone vital to calcium homeostasis and bone health, has \nemerged as a pivotal regulator of the immune system. Beyond its classical role in skeletal integrity, extensive research over recent decades has illuminated its potent immunomod ulatory properties, implicating it in various facets of immune function and \nautoimmune diseases [42,43] . It was observed to stimulate immune responses, \nparticularly against infectious pathogens like tuberculosis and leprosy [44,45]. These \n\ufb01ndings marked the early understanding of vitamin D not just as a nutritional factor but \nalso as a hormone with profound e\ufb00ects on the immune system. In particular, vitamin D \nexerts its immunomodulatory e\ufb00ects through several mechanisms involving both innate and adaptive immune responses (Figure 1). At the level of innate immunity, vitamin D plays a crucial role in enhancing antimicrobial peptide production in epithelial cells, such \nas defensin \u03b22 and cathelicidin, which are pivotal in innate defence against invading \npathogens [46]. In the skin, for instance, where vitamin D is synthesised in response to \nexposure to sunligh t, it promotes the integrity of the epithelial barrier and assists with \nlocal immune responses [47]. Moreover, vitamin D regulates the function of macrophages and monocytes, which are key players in the innate immune system. These cells express \nvitamin D r eceptors (VDRs ) and can produce the active form of vitamin D (1,25 -\ndihydroxyvitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3) locally in response to infections [48]. 1,25(OH)2D3 \nenhances the innate immune response by promoting phagocytosis, cytokine production, \nand antimicrobial peptide synth esis, contributing to pathogen clearance and immune \nsurveillance [49].  \n \nFigure 1.

Immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D on innate and adaptive immune responses. The\nfigure describes the effect of vitamin D on B lymphocytes and activated T lymphocytes (the adaptive\nimmune system) and macrophages, neutrophils, NKs, and dendritic cells (the innate immune system).\nVitamin D drives the phenotype shift from Th17 and Th1 to Treg and Th2, respectively. Accordingly,\nthe production of INF \u03b3and IL-17 by Th17 is decreased, while the production of IL-10 and IL-\n4/5/10/13 by Treg and Th2, respectively, is increased. The green and magenta arrows represent,\nrespectively, the increase and decrease in the production of designated molecule.\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 5 of 17\nIn adaptive immunity, vitamin D plays a pivotal role in modulating the functions\nof T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). T regulatory cells (Tregs), a subset of T cells\ncrucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, are particularly\ninfluenced by vitamin D [ 50,51]. Vitamin D promotes the development and function of\nTregs, thereby suppressing excessive immune responses and promoting immune homeosta-\nsis [52]. Furthermore, vitamin D influences antigen presentation and cytokine production\nby dendritic cells, and these processes are pivotal in activating T cells and shaping immune\nresponses [ 53]. By promoting an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile and dampening pro-\ninflammatory responses, vitamin D helps maintain immune balance and tolerance, which\nare crucial for preventing autoimmune reactions (Figure 1) [54].\nThe relationship between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmune diseases has garnered\nsignificant attention in epidemiological studies worldwide. Numerous investigations\nhave highlighted a consistent association between low vitamin D levels and increased\nrisk or severity of autoimmune conditions [ 55]. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for instance,\nexhibits higher prevalence and disease activity in individuals with deficient vitamin D\nstatus [ 56,57]. Similar associations have been observed in systemic lupus erythematosus\n(SLE) [ 58], multiple sclerosis (MS) [ 59,60], and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ 61],\namong others [62,63].\nThe mechanisms underlying vitamin D\u2019s protective role in autoimmune diseases are\nmultifaceted. Vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate autoimmune responses by impairing\nimmune regulation and promoting pro-inflammatory pathways [ 64,65]. Conversely, vi-\ntamin D supplementation has shown promising immunomodulatory effects with regard\nto mitigating disease activity and improving clinical outcomes in autoimmune patients.\nClinical trials and observational studies have explored the efficacy of vitamin D supple-\nmentation in autoimmune conditions, aiming to optimise treatment outcomes and improve\npatients\u2019 quality of life [ 66\u201369]. However, challenges remain, including variability in in-\ndividual responses to vitamin D therapy and the optimal dosing regimens required to\nachieve therapeutic benefits. Future research directions include elucidating the molecular\nmechanisms underlying vitamin D\u2019s immunomodulatory effects, exploring its interactions\nwith other immune regulatory pathways, and conducting robust clinical trials to estab-\nlish evidence-based guidelines for vitamin D supplementation in autoimmune disease\nmanagement.\nThe Role of Vitamin D in pSS\nThe association between vitamin D and pSS is rather contradictory. Thus, low levels\nof vitamin D were found to be associated with pSS in some meta-analyses [ 70,71], while no\nassociation was found in another study [ 72]. Moreover, a low serum level of Calcifediol\n(25(OH)D3) was associated with the corneal staining score, conjunctival staining score,\nSchirmer I value, and tear breakup time in Korean pSS patients [ 73]. Similarly, another\nKorean study found that low serum levels of 25(OH)-D3 were associated with EULAR\nSjogren\u2019s syndrome disease activity index in pSS patients [ 74]. On the contrary, no asso-\nciation was found in Indian [ 75] and Chinese [ 76] pSS patients. These results suggested\na strong need for studies with larger sample sizes to further unravel the potential causal\nrelationship and the exact underlying molecular mechanisms.\nRecent experiments on pSS mice model (thrombospondin-1 knock-out (TSP-1 KO)\nmice) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from pSS patients provided\nsome novel insights into the functional significance of vitamin D in pSS. Therefore, TSP-1\nKO mice demonstrated reduced serum levels of 25(OH)D3 and developed dry eye, while\noral vitamin D supplementation improved its serum levels and restored central corneal\nepithelial thickness and the corneal structure in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore,\n25(OH)D3 supplementation reduced corneal levels of TNF-Alpha-Converting Enzyme\n(TACE), TNF \u03b1, TGF \u03b1, VEGFR2, VEGFA, TGF \u03b2, and SMAD2/3, thus inhibiting corneal\nneovascularisation, inflammation, derangement, and fibrosis [ 77]. Similarly, 25(OH)D3\ntreatment decreased Th lymphocyte proliferative responses and B lymphocyte proliferation\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 6 of 17\nin Turkish pSS patients and pSS PBMC cultures compared to PBMC cultures alone. Also,\n25(OH)D3 treatment increased the frequency of FoxP3 expressing CD4+CD25+ Treg cell,\nthus decreasing IFN \u03b3and IL-17 secretion, while the level of IL-10 was increased (Figure 1).\nFinally, 25(OH)D3 treatment decreased plasma B cell subsets and increased the total mem-\nory B lymphocyte ratio in pSS patients compared to PBMC cultures alone [ 78]. Overall,\nthese results proposed the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D\nsupplementation as the main beneficial mechanisms of pSS treatment.\nInterestingly, so far only one vitamin D-related SNP was characterised as a risk factor\nfor pSS, SLE, and RA. Therefore, an analysis of Italian patients with autoimmune diseases\nshowed that vitamin D receptor (VDR ) rs7975232 (T>G) homozygous genotype (GG) was\nassociated with susceptibility to all investigated autoimmune connective tissue disorders.\nMechanically, rs7975232 GG was associated with production of anti-DNA, anti-RNP , anti-\nSSA, and anti-SSB autoantibodies in SLE patients, and with production of anti-SSA in pSS\npatients [ 79]. On the contrary, the VDR-focused investigation on the Hungarian population\nfound no difference in VDR SNPs between pSS patients and healthy controls [80].\nIn total, the provided results suggest a rather contradictory role of vitamin D and VDR\nSNPs in pSS. However, it is important to note that while the role of vitamin D levels in pSS\nhas been investigated in patients of many ethnicities, the number of studies focused on\nthe identification of pSS-related SNPs in vitamin D metabolism genes is extremely limited.\nTherefore, the relationship between VDR SNPs rs7975232 and pSS may be specific only\nto the Italian population. Future multi-ethnic studies with larger sample sizes should be\nconducted to provide a clear view of the connection between vitamin D and the risk of pSS\ndevelopment throughout different populations.\n3. SNPs Associated with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome\n3.1. Overview of Genetic Findings in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome\nIn recent decade, implementation of next generation sequencing, novel bioinformatic\nand biostatistic approaches enabled specific genetic analyses of race-dependent pSS-specific\nSNPs. Such genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been conducted on thousands\nof subjects from Europe [ 81,82], Italy [ 83,84], China [ 85,86], Korea [ 87], Asia [ 88], and others.\nAs expected, some gene variants were significant in Europeans, but not in Chinese patients,\nsuggesting that different populations may have different pSS risk-associated SNPs. The\n\u2018classical\u2019 PCR methods, expensive and time consuming, allowed to analyse very limited\nnumber of SNPs, while modern next-generation sequencing revealed tens of new SNPs.\nTherefore, the exploration of genetic underpinnings in pSS has unveiled significant insights\ninto its pathogenesis, particularly through the study of specific gene variants and their role\nin disease susceptibility and phenotype variation. Further, we discuss cumulative findings\nfrom multiple studies (cited at the beginning of this paragraph) on genetic associations in\npSS, emphasising inflammation and interferon signalling pathways, among others, and\nexploring ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility.\n3.2. Key Genetic Pathways and Variants\nInterferon pathway: The interferon (IFN) signalling pathway is a prominent feature\nin autoimmune diseases, including pSS. For example, the association of Signal Transducer\nAnd Activator Of Transcription 4 (STAT4 ), a transcription factor that regulates T-helper\ndifferentiation and interferon production [ 89,90], with pSS, particularly the rs7574865\npolymorphism, underscores the critical role of this pathway. The minor allele of rs7574865\nhas been linked to increased STAT4 expression and heightened sensitivity to IFN \u03b1, which\ncould enhance the autoimmune process in pSS patients. This association aligns with\nobservations related to other autoimmune disorders like RA and SLE, where STAT4 variants\nhave been similarly implicated. Among other variants relevant for this pathway, we can\nalso mention Interferon Gamma Receptor (IFNGR1/2 ),Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5 ),\nDihydrouridine Synthase 2 (DUS2 ).\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 7 of 17\nInflammatory pathways: Many studies have identified several genetic variants as-\nsociated with inflammatory processes in pSS. Notably, the IL-10 gene, which encodes a\ncytokine that modulates inflammation and immune responses [ 91], exhibits dual effects\nin pSS. The rs3024505 variant is associated with increased susceptibility to SS, while the\nrs1800872 variant appears protective. IL-10\u2019s role in regulating Th1 responses and modulat-\ning MHC class II antigens highlights its complex involvement in SS pathology. Variants\nof IL-10 could influence disease severity and progression by altering cytokine production\nand inflammatory responses. The findings related to the HCP5 gene further illustrate the\nconnection between genetic variants and inflammatory disease mechanisms. The rs3099844\nvariant in HCP5 is linked to the presence of anti-SSB antibodies and autoantibodies such\nas rheumatoid factor (RF), suggesting that it plays a role in promoting a more aggressive\ninflammatory phenotype. HCP5 \u2019s association with autoantibody production, particularly\nin the context of pSS, highlights its potential role in disease severity and progression. The\nother genes related to this pathway are Nuclear Factor NF-Kappa-B Activator 1 (TRAF3IP2 ),\nTNF Alpha Induced Protein 3 (TNFAIP3 ),IL-4R ,IL-6,IL-12A ,IL-12RB1 ,IL-12RB2 ,IL-18 , and\nIL-18R1 [83].\nT cell receptor (TCR) signalling pathway: Genetic studies have also pointed to the T\ncell pathway\u2019s involvement in pSS. The discovery of common variants in TCR-pathway\ngenes across multiple autoimmune diseases, including SS, RA, and SLE, suggests that T\ncell activation and signalling play a crucial role in autoimmune pathogenesis. Variants\nof genes like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type C (PTPRC ),Lymphocyte Cell-Specific\nProtein-Tyrosine Kinase (LCK ),Linker For Activation Of T Cells (LAT ),Tec Protein Tyrosine\nKinase (TEC ), and Nuclear Factor Of Activated T Cells 5 (NFAT5 ), which are involved in TCR\nsignalling, have been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. These findings\nsupport the hypothesis that T cell-driven immunity is a key factor in the development of\nautoimmune conditions, including pSS [92,93].\n3.3. Ethnic Differences and Genetic Associations\nA significant aspect of the genetic studies on pSS is the variation in genetic associations\nacross different ethnic groups [ 82,86,87]. Thus, the international multi-ethnic GWASs\nhighlighted distinct genetic associations in European and Asian populations, reflecting the\ndiversity in genetic susceptibility [ 88]. For example, the association between KLRG1 and SS\nwas observed specifically in Asian cohorts, while European studies identified significant\nassociations with different MHC regions. This variation underscores the importance of\nconsidering ethnic differences in genetic research and highlights the need for larger, more\ninclusive studies to capture the full spectrum of genetic diversity in autoimmune diseases.\nThe presence of SNPs with varying effects across ethnic groups suggests that genetic\nsusceptibility to SS is influenced by population-specific allele frequencies and haplotype\nstructures. Such differences can affect the interpretation of genetic findings and their\napplication to clinical practise. Future research should aim to integrate genetic data from\ndiverse populations to enhance our understanding of SS\u2019s susceptibility and pathogenesis.\n4. Interaction with Other Diseases\nInterestingly, previous findings showed an association between pSS and other diseases,\nsuggesting the existence of shared genetic susceptibility loci involved in the co-occurrence\nof these diseases. For example, meta-analyses found that pSS-associated SNPs increased\nthe primary biliary cholangitis, and vice versa, in a European population [ 94], while no\nimpact on the risk of Parkinson\u2019s Disease was found [ 95]. Moreover, a number of recent\nstudies have investigated the impact of pSS-associated SNPs on the risk of developing\nother diseases (Table 1) (Figure 2).\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 8 of 17\nTable 1.

Further\nanalysis revealed that the patient\u2019s Nudix Hydrolase 15 (NUDT15 ), which is responsible for\nhydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates, contained an R139C mutation, which decreased\nthe patient\u2019s enzyme function. Apparently, the R139C version of NUDT15 could not\nmetabolise AZA with the necessary speed and caused an accumulation of 6-thioguanine\nnucleotides (6-TGN) in the erythrocytes. Therefore, mutant NUDT15 R139C (TT genotype)\nand blood 6-TGN levels should be monitored in patients receiving AZA to predict and\nprevent AZA-induced myelosuppression [97].\nAnother study found a casual association between pSS and susceptibility to neu-\nromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), another autoimmune demyelinating disease\nof the central nervous system, which may lead to blindness and paralysis. In particular,\nanalysing GWAS results using the Mendelian randomization (MR) method showed that\nthe rs1264347 T allele of Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 243 (LINC00243 ) and\nthe rs429150 C allele of Tenascin XB (TNXB ) increase the risk of developing NMOSD [ 98].\nMoreover, previous studies demonstrated that LINC00243 variants were involved in im-\nmune dysregulation associated with Type 1 diabetes [ 107], while TNXB variants can cause\nhereditary primary vesicoureteral reflux. However, prospective cohorts with large sample\nsizes and further lab experiments may be required to evaluate the exact role of LINC00243\nand TNXB SNPs in pSS and NMOSD [ 108]. Furthermore, the development of dry eye\nsyndrome (DES), an ophthalmological complication of SS that manifests in the form of\ncorneal nerve fibre lesions, was recently associated with SNPs in Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1 ).\nTherefore, rs1478604 and rs2228262 THBS1 SNPs correlated with coefficients of anisotropy\nand symmetry, predisposing the rs1478604 CC genotype and rs2228262 GG with DES\nseverity [106].\nFatigue, often described as \u2018an overwhelming sense of tiredness, exhaustion, and\nlack of energy\u2019, affects the majority of pSS patients and greatly reduces their quality of\nlife [ 109]. Recently, several SNPs have been linked to fatigue in pSS, including several SNPs\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 10 of 17\nbetween receptor transporter protein 4/Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1 (RTP4/MASP1 ),\nendoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signalling 1 (ERN1 ),LIM homeobox 1 locus (LHX1 ), and\nLOC102723654 (Table 1). Interestingly, the minor alleles of all the identified SNPs (except for\nthe major allele of rs10048170 LHX1 ) were associated with reduced fatigue parameters [ 99].\nWhile the exact molecular mechanisms explaining the role of RTP4 /MASP2 , and ERN1,\nSNPs in fatigue-relevant functions and phenotypes are not known, they may be linked\nthrough several pathways: 1) the role of RTP4 in the organisation of \u03b3-\u03b4opioid pain\nreceptors and severe depression and suicidal behaviour during IFNa treatment of hepatitis\nC infections [ 110,111]; MASP1 is involved in complement activation through C2 cleavage,\nthus connecting inflammation and fatigue [ 112]; ERN1 is a sensor of unfolded proteins\nin the endoplasmic reticulum, which triggers an intracellular stress signalling pathway\nknown as unfolded protein response [ 113]. The role of LHX1 and LOC102723654 and their\nSNPs in fatigue-associated regulatory pathways remains to be elucidated.\nNovel fatigue-related SNPs were also identified in BAFF , another well-known gene\nassociated with pSS. Thus, among five BAFF SNPs, only the TT genotype of rs9514828 was\nless frequent in fatigued compared to non-fatigued Greek pSS patients. Interestingly, no\nassociation between the rs9514828 TT genotype and fatigue occurrence was detected in\nmultiple sclerosis patients [100].\nLymphoma: Historically, lymphoma was known to be the most severe complication of\nSS, as SS patients have a reported 44-fold higher risk of developing lymphoma compared\nto the general population [ 114]. Recent meta-analyses, Mendelian randomisation, and\nSystematic Reviews suggested that non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) occurs in approx-\nimately 3%\u201310% of pSS patients, with the most prevalent histological types including\nmucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL),\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and follicular lymphoma (FL) [ 115\u2013119]. Further,\nwe describe the recently identified gene variants shown to increase the risk of lymphoma.\nTherefore, rs2230926 SNP of TNF Alpha Induced Protein 3 (TNFAIP3 ), which is involved\nin the cytokine-mediated immune and inflammatory responses through inhibition of NF-\nkappa B activation as well as TNF-mediated apoptosis, was shown to enhance the risk\nof pSS-associated lymphoma in French and UK cohorts. Apparently, rs2230926G variant\nimpaired control of NF-kB activation in B cells that were continuously stimulated by\nautoimmunity, thus increasing the risk of lymphoma [ 101]. Subsequently, these results\nwere confirmed in another study conducted on Italian pSS patients [102].\nGenetic variations of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR ) gene were linked\nto various cardiovascular diseases, pregnancy complications [ 120], autoimmune disorders,\nand lymphoma [ 121,122]. A recent study characterised rs1801133 and rs1801131 MTHFR\nSNPs as contributors to pSS-related non-MALT lymphomagenesis. In particular, the TT\ngenotype and T allele of rs1801133 and AA genotype and A allele of rs1801131 were more\nfrequent in the pSS non-MALT NHL group compared to controls and patients without\nNHL. Furthermore, the rs1801133 TT genotype was associated with reduced levels of\nDNA methylation, while the rs1801131 AC genotype was associated with reduced levels\nof double-strand breaks. These results suggested that rs1801133 and rs1801131 MTHFR\nvariants are involved in the development of pSS-associated non-MALT NHL through their\ncontributions to defective DNA methylation and genomic instability [104].\nGenetic variants of Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 (TREX1 ), another gene involved\nin DNA repair and degradation, have been previously linked to familial chilblain lupus\nand SLE [ 123,124]. Recent findings demonstrated a decreased prevalence of rs11797 A\nallele in pSS patients with non-MALT lymphoma. Furthermore, pSS patients who were\ncarriers of the rs11797 AA genotype showed increased expression of type I IFN-related\ngenes ( Interferon-Induced GTP-Binding Protein Mx1 and TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3 ) in\nminor salivary gland tissues. These results suggested a genetically related reduction in\ntype I IFN production as a probable mechanism for pSS-associated lymphomagenesis [ 105].\nFinally, variations of the Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A3 (LILRA3 ) gene have\nbeen shown to have a drastic effect on both pSS and NHL susceptibility in different popu-\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 11 of 17\nlations. Thus, a version with a deletion (absence of the first seven exons) was associated\nwith increased susceptibility to pSS and NHL in the German population [ 125,126], while in\na Chinese population, the functional LILRA3 variant increased susceptibility to pSS and\nSLE [ 127]. Therefore, recent research also linked it to the development of pSS-associated\nlymphoma in a Greek population, where a functional LILRA3 gene variant was prevalent in\nthe young pSS patients with lymphoma. Interestingly, young pSS patients with lymphoma\nshowed higher serum LILRA3 protein levels compared to healthy controls [ 103]. As a\npossible mechanism, LILRA3 protein may trigger a cellular immune response by activating\nproliferation of cytotoxic-CD8+T and NK cells [126].\n5. Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and management of primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s\nsyndrome (pSS) remains an area of active investigation with somewhat conflicting findings.\nWhile some studies have linked low vitamin D levels to increased pSS severity and activity,\nothers have not observed such an association, suggesting that genetic, environmental, or\nethnic factors may play a significant role. Experimental studies in animal models and\npatient-derived cells have shown that vitamin D supplementation may exert beneficial\nimmunomodulatory effects, such as reducing inflammatory cytokine production, restoring\nepithelial integrity, and promoting regulatory T cell activity. These findings support the\npotential of vitamin D application in pSS treatment.\nHowever, the current research has important limitations, including small sample\nsizes, a lack of ethnic diversity, and inconsistent study designs, which complicate the\ninterpretation of results. Additionally, only one vitamin D-related SNP (VDR rs7975232)\nhas been identified as a potential risk factor for pSS, and its association appears to be\nspecific to certain populations, underscoring the need for further genetic studies.\nFuture research should aim to explore the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory\nroles of vitamin D more comprehensively. Studies should focus on large, multi-ethnic\ncohorts to better understand how vitamin D levels and genetic variations, such as VDR\npolymorphisms, affect disease susceptibility and progression. Investigating the molecular\nmechanisms by which vitamin D modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses\nin pSS will be crucial. This includes understanding how vitamin D impacts cytokine\nproduction, T and B cell function, and the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-\ninflammatory pathways.\nFurthermore, clinical trials should evaluate optimal dosing strategies and combi-\nnations with other treatments to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin D. Under-\nstanding the gene\u2013environment interactions that influence vitamin D metabolism and its\nimmunomodulatory effects will also provide insights for developing personalised, targeted\ntreatments for pSS, potentially using vitamin D as a core component in managing the\ninflammatory and autoimmune processes characteristic of the disease.\nLooking ahead, integrating genetic testing into clinical practise holds promise for\nimproving disease management and treatment strategies for pSS. Developing compre-\nhensive genetic panels that identify individuals at risk for pSS, its complications, and\nassociated diseases could lead to more targeted interventions. Additionally, investigating\ngene\u2013environment interactions will provide a better understanding of pSS pathogenesis\nand inform preventive strategies. Moreover, genetic profiling can assist with predicting\ndisease risk and tailoring treatment strategies. The development of genetic models to assess\nthe risk of pSS based on SNPs, such as those in STAT4 ,IL-10 , and HCP5 , could improve\ndisease prediction and management. Personalised approaches to treatment, guided by\ngenetic information, may enhance efficacy and minimise adverse effects.\nThe development of targeted therapies based on genetic findings offers a new avenue\nfor treatment. Research should focus on drugs or interventions that address specific genetic\nmechanisms underlying pSS symptoms and complications. Longitudinal studies will\nbe crucial in validating these genetic associations and ensuring that findings translate\neffectively into clinical practise.\nDiagnostics 2024 ,14, 2035 12 of 17\nIn summary, integrating genetic insights into the understanding and management of\npSS offers significant potential for advancing patient care through personalised medicine.\nBy focusing on specific SNPs and their implications for disease risk and severity, future\nresearch can lead to more effective and tailored approaches to managing pSS.\nAuthor Contributions: S.A.D. and N.A.O. conceptualised the manuscript; S.A.D. wrote the manuscript;\nN.A.O., A.V .C., I.A.S., D.F.B., T.I.K. and V .N.S. reviewed the text; A.V .C. and T.I.K. were responsible\nfor the methodology; I.A.S., D.F.B. and N.A.O. conducted the formal analysis; A.V .C., I.A.S. and D.F.B.\nperformed the validation; V .N.S. and N.A.O. obtained the funding.
