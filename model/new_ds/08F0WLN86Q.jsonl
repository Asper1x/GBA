This study investigated the effects of cavitation jet (CJ) pretreatment at different time (0, 60, 120, 180, 240, \n300 s) intervals on the recovery of soy whey protein (SWP) from soy whey wastewater using chitosan (CH). In \naddition, the structure and properties of the SWP/CH complexes were examined. The results showed that the \nrecovery yield of SWP reached 84.44 % when the CJ pretreatment time was 180 s, and the EAI and ESI values of \nthe SWP/CH complex increased from 32.39 m2/g and 21 min to 48.47 m2/g and 32 min, respectively. In the CJ \npretreatment process, SWP promotes the recombination with chitosan through electrostatic interaction and \nhydrogen bond, while hydrophobic interaction is also involved. This study has guiding significance for CJ \ntechnology in the recovery and utilization of protein in industrial wastewater.   \n1.Introduction \nOwing to its exceptional functional characteristics and low cost, soy \nprotein isolate (SPI) has emerged as the most widely consumed plant- \nbased protein worldwide. The production of every ton of SPI generates \n20 t of soy whey wastewater (Wang, Wu, Zhao, Liu, & Gao, 2013 ). \nUntreated disposal of the majority of soy whey wastewater after pro-\nduction may lead to environmental pollution and significant depletion \nof valuable compounds such as soy whey protein (SWP) (Liu, Zhang, Wu, \nWang, & Wang, 2013 ). SWP, a protein that can dissolve in acid and has \nsignificant nutritional benefits, can be added to different food products \nas a functional compounds owing to its high nutritional value (Tu et al., \n2019 ). Additionally, SWP can serve as a structural agent or delivery \nsystem for bioactive substances in food, following chemical and physical \nalterations (Lavelli & Beccalli, 2022 ). Hence, the effective reuse of soy \nwhey wastewater is anticipated to partially offset handling and disposal \nexpenses while also generating valuable protein resources. \nThe conventional technique of using ammonium sulfate for precipi -\ntation can be employed to isolate SWP from soy whey wastewater. Salt \nprecipitation for recovering proteins from wastewater is limited because \nof the need for strict control of salt concentration, easy decomposition of ammonium salts, and desalination of the product. The use of poly-\nsaccharides for flocculation and protein recovery is a distinct technique \nthat has been extensively used for protein separation. Protein waste -\nwater can be treated with chitosan due to its unique macromolecular \ncomposition and physicochemical properties. According the study of \nWibowo et al. (2005) , chitosan is an effective bioflocculant for the \nextraction of soluble proteins from surimi wash water. Enhancing the \nprotein recovery efficiency in industrial-scale protein extraction pro-\ncesses can be achieved by incorporating physical field mediation. \nNguyen et al. (2020) proposed a combination of ultrasonic extraction \nand chitosan co-precipitation as a highly effective method for extracting \nnutritional proteins from the heads of Australian Rock Lobsters. The \nresults of studies have shown that the spatial conformational changes of \nproteins, including structural expansion and increased exposure of hy-\ndrophobic regions, will affect the recovery efficiency of polysaccharides. \nThese changes may influence the processing and application of the \nresulting protein complex. According to a previous study conducted by \nGuo et al. (2023) , CJ pretreatment has the potential to disrupt disulfide \nbonds within proteins, leading to the expansion of skeleton structures, \nreduction in aggregate sizes and molecular weights, and enhancement of \nemulsion activities. According to this study, the physical field produced \n*Corresponding authors. \nE-mail addresses: wzjname@126.com (Z. Wang), dorisneau@126.com (L.

This study developed a \nnovel method on SWP recovery by CJ pretreatment assisted chitosan and \nprovided theoretical support and reference significance for the recovery \nand reuse of food wastewater resources using CJ technology. \n2.Materials and methods \n2.1. Materials \nSoy whey wastewater (solid content 2.2 \u00b10.2 %, crude protein \ncontent (dry basis) 18 \u00b10.5 %, pH 4.6 \u00b10.1) was obtained from \nShandong Yuwang Ecological Food Industry Co., Ltd. (Shandong, \nChina). Chitosan (with a deacetylation degree of at least 85 %, 100,000 \nDa) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., \nLtd. (Shanghai, China). Corn oil was provided from Jiusan OILS and \nGrains Industries Group Co., Ltd. (Harbin, China). \nNile red, bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) protein kit and sodium \ndodecyl sulfate (SDS) were bought from Yuanye Biotechnology Co. Ltd. \n(Shanghai, China). All other reagents used were analytical grade. \n2.2. Formulation of samples for CJ pretreatment \nThe soy whey wastewater was rested at 4 \u2022C for 24 h. Wastewater \nwas centrifuged (8000 g, 30 min) to remove residual soy protein isolate. \nAdjust the pH of the supernatant to 8.0 and repeat the centrifugation \nstep to obtain the supernatant. Dialysis (MW 3500 Da) the supernatant \nat 4 \u2022C for 48 h to remove salt ions, the deionized water was replaced \nevery 6 h. Then the protein concentration was diluted to 1 % (w/v). The \nsoy whey wastewater was treated at 90 Mpa for 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 s by SL-2 Cavitation Jet Machine (Beijing Zhongsen Huijia Tech-\nnology Development Co., LTD., China). \n2.3. Recovery of SWP/CH complexes \nThe pH of soy whey wastewater with different CJ pretreatment time \nwas adjusted to 6.0. Chitosan (1 % w/v) was added into soy whey \nwastewater at a ratio of 1:5 (chitosan:SWP). After stirring for 30 min, the \nsolution rested for 4 h. The solution was centrifuged at 4 \u2022C, 8000 g for \n30 min to obtain the SWP/CH complexes precipitate. The SWP/CH \ncomplexes precipitate was dissolved in purified water and adjusted pH \nto 9.0. Let it sat overnight to remove insoluble chitosan. The solution \nwas centrifuged for 30 min (8000 g, 4 \u2022C) to obtain the supernatant. \nAfter adjusting the pH to 7.0, the solution was centrifuged for 30 min \n(8000 g, 4 \u2022C) obtain the supernatant. Dialyze (MW 3500 Da) the su-\npernatant for 48 h at 4 \u2022C. During this process, the deionized water was \nreplaced every 6 h. Then SWP/CH complexes were obtained by freeze- \ndried. These samples were named CJ-0, CJ-60, CJ-120, CJ-180, CJ- \n240, and CJ-300. \nControl group was prepared following the modified techniques \ndescribed by Sorgentini and Wagner (1999) . Briefly, the proteins were \nthrough salting out using ammonium sulfate (75 %) at 25 \u2022C and \ncentrifuged for 30 min (8000 g, 4 \u2022C) to obtain protein precipitate. \nDissolved the protein precipitation in deionized water, then adjusted pH \nto 7.0 with HCl (2 mol/L). The dialysis and freeze-drying are the same as \nabove. Samples was named Control. A flux diagram of sample prepa -\nration is shown in Fig. 1. \n2.4. Recovery yield \nThe Kjeldahl method was employed to evaluate protein levels, which \nwere then analyzed by the Kjeldahl system from Velp Scientifica (UDK \n132, Italy). The results are expressed as the percentage of protein con-\ntent, assuming a conversion factor of 6.25. Protein recovery was \nassessed using the method described by Jiang et al. (2022) . Protein re-\ncovery yields were calculated as follows: \nFig 1.The preparation procedure of the Control, CJ-0, CJ-60, CJ-120, CJ-180, CJ-240 and CJ-300.  C.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) \nThe method for measuring Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was \nmodified by Zhang et al. (2020) . The thermodynamic properties and \nfactors of complex coacervation between SWP and chitosan were \ndetermined at pH 6.0 and 25 \u2022C using ITC-200 Microcalorimeter (Micro \nCal Inc., Northampton, UK). At first, SWP solution (0.06 % w/v) and \nchitosan solution (0.12 % w/v) were degassing at 23 \u2022C using a Micro \nCal degasser. Afterwards, 1.7 mL SWP solution was added to the reaction \ncell, while the syringe contained 300 \u03bcL of chitosan solution. The dilu-\ntion temperature was determined by titrating the chitosan solution with \nMilli-Q water under the same conditions and at the corresponding pH \nlevels. Three measurements were obtained for each task. \n2.6. Zeta potential \nThe deionized water as a solvent, samples were dissolved (0.1 % w/ \nv). The zeta potential of each sample was measured using Malvern zeta \npotential analyzer (Malvern Pana Technology Co., Ltd., China), with a \ncuvette length of 1 cm\u00001 and a spacing of 0.4 cm\u00001. \n2.7. Particle size distribution and turbidity \nA particle size analyzer (Nano-ZS90, Malvern Instruments, UK) was \nused to estimate the particle size distribution of the samples. To avoid \nmultiple scattering effects, phosphate buffered saline (1 % w/v PBS, pH \n7.0) was added to prepare diluted samples (0.1 % w/v). The refractive \nindex was determined as 1.460, which was adjusted to 1.330 to account \nfor the dispersant. Additionally, information on the polydispersity index \n(PDI) is provided. The measurements were conducted three times at \n25 \u2022C. \nThe absorbance at 600 nm was recorded using a UV\u2013Visible spec-\ntrophotometer (UV-3900, Shimadzu, Japan) to measure the turbidity of \nsamples. A blank reference was prepared using deionized water. The \nmeasurements were conducted three times at 25 \u2022C. \n2.8. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy \nThe samples powder was pressed into tablets with KBr, the FTIR \nspectra was recorded using a IS10 FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet, US) in the \nwavenumber range 4000 \u2013400 cm\u00001. The background for each test \nconsisted of 32 air scans. The data was analyzed using Win GX (version \n4.1) software. Spectra were baseline corrected and the first derivative \nspectra were plotted. Spectra were visually checked to ensure accuracy. \n2.9. Surface hydrophobicity \nDilute the sample to a protein concentration of 0.1\u20131.0 % (w/v) by \nphosphate buffered saline (PBS, 1 % w/v, pH 7.0). Next, 20 \u00b5L of ANS \nwere added to 4 mL of the prepared solutions. The intensity of the \nfluorescent signal was measured using Ultraviolet visible spectropho -\ntometer (UV-3900, Shimadzu, Japan) at 390 nm and 465 nm (excitation \nand emission). The S0 was acquired from gradient of the correlation \nbetween the fluorescence intensity and protein concentration (Xie et al., \n2023 ). \n2.10. Protein solubility \nThe method for measuring protein solubility was modified by Chen et al. (2023) . Briefly, the sample solution (0.2 % w/v) was stirred for 15 \nmin at 25 \u2022C and centrifuged for 15 min (8000 g, 4 \u2022C). The BCA protein \nkit was employed to determine the protein solubility in the supernatant. \nUsing bovine serum protein as a standard. \n2.11. Emulsifying activity index (EAI) and emulsion stability index (ESI) \nThe method for measuring EAI and ESI was modified by Li et al. \n(2020) . In order to obtain the emulsion, 90 mL of solution (0.2 % w/v \nproteins) and 10 mL of corn oil were mixed and homogenized for three \ncycles using Spch-10 High-Pressure Homogenizer (AXA United Tech-\nnology Co., Ltd. China) under 30 MPa. At 0 min and 20 min after ho-\nmogenization, 50 \u03bcL of emulsion was immediately taken out at the \nbottom of the emulsion, and then diluted 100 times with SDS solution (1 \n% w/v). A spectrophotometer (Beckman DU 500, Fullerton, CA, USA) \nwas used to determine absorbance at 500 nm. The EAI and ESI are \ndefined as follows: \nEAI[m2\ng]\n\u00882B302\u00d72\u00d7DF\u00d7A0\n10000\u00d7c\u00d7\u03b5\u00d7\u00851\u0000\u03b8\u0086(2)  \nESI\u0085min\u0086\u0088A0\nA0\u0000A20\u00d7\u0085T20\u0000T0\u0086 (3)  \nwhere DF was the dilution factor multiplied by 100, A0 was the absor -\nbance of the thinned emulsion at 0 min, c was the protein concentration \nin grams per milliliter. \u03b5 was the optical path of 1 cm, \u03b8 was the volume \nfraction of the SWP/CH complex, which is 0.90, A20 was the absorbance \nafter 20 min, T20 was a duration of 20 min, T0 was a duration of 0 min. \n2.12. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) \nFor sample staining, 500 \u03bcL of newly prepared emulsions were \ndarkly stained with a mixture of 20 \u03bcL fluorescent dye composed of Nile \nred and Nile blue (0.1 % w/v, dissolved by absolute isopropanol). Nile \nRed was excited at 488 nm, whereas Nile Blue was excited at 633 nm (Ki, \nParameswaran, Popat, Rittmann, & Torres, 2015 ). \n2.13. Adsorbed protein percentage (AP%) \nThe method for measuring adsorbed protein percentage was modi -\nfied by Liang and Tang (2013) . The samples emulsion was centrifuged \nfor 15 min (8000 g, 20 \u2022C) to obtain an upper layer, called the emulsion \nlayer, and a lower layer, known as the aqueous phase. The lower \naqueous phase was extracted using a syringe and filtered through a 0.22 \n\u03bcm membrane to determine the protein content in the aqueous phase \nusing the BCA method. The adsorbed protein percentage (AP %) was \ncalculated as follows, \nAP\u0085%\u0086\u0088C0\u0000CS\nC0\u00d7100% (4)  \nwhere C0 was the protein concentration in the initial protein solution, CS \nwas the concentration of the protein that has not been adsorbed. \n2.14. Statistical analysis \nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0. Mea-\nsurements were conducted in triplicate which is independent. The out-\ncomes were reported as the average plus the standard deviation (SD). \nDuncan multiple comparison method was used to conduct one-way \nANOVA on the data, and the significance was set at p D0.05.

Recovery yield \nSWP recovery in Control and CJ pretreatment synergistic chitosan \ngroups is shown in Fig. 2 A. The process of extracting SWP using \nammonium sulfate involves the utilization of NH4\u0087and SO42- ions to \nprecipitate SWP, which disrupts surface hydration. SWP was recovered \nthrough the salting-out effect. Chitosan offers a polycationic property \nthat serves as an ionizable polyelectrolyte in solution, which has the \nability to enhance the flocculation of SWP through electrostatic in-\nteractions (Nguyen, Luo, Su, Balakrishnan, & Zhang, 2020 ), allowing \nSWP to be recovered. The result showed that the recovery rate of SWP \nusing chitosan was higher than the Control. Therefore, the recovery of \nSWP using chitosan is advantageous for protein recovery in food pro-\ncessing streams. However, the spatial structural variation of SWP can \ndirectly affect their recovery by chitosan through electrostatic in-\nteractions. The structure of SWP was altered by CJ pretreatment, and the \neffect of chitosan on the recovery of SWP at different pretreatment times \nwas evaluated. With an increase in the CJ pretreatment time, the re-\ncovery rate of SWP using chitosan showed a trend of first increased and \nthen decreased. The flexibility and overall charge of the SWP molecules \nare increased by mechanical shear, thermal decomposition, and free \nradical oxidation effects induced by the CJ (Guo et al., 2023 ). This \nimproved the flocculation of SWP by exposing more binding sites for \nelectrostatic interactions with chitosan. However, the extended duration \nof CJ pretreatment elicits the re-aggregation of SWP, impedes its \nunfolding, and diminishes the availability of binding sites on the SWP \nsurface for chitosan. Therefore, the decrease in the binding ability be-\ntween aggregated SWP and chitosan leads to a decrease in the recovery rate of SWP. \n3.2. ITC \nITC is a direct method for examining the interactions between SWP \nand chitosan (Campi ~na et al., 2010 ). Fig. 3 showed the CJ-0 and CJ-180 \nsamples produced heat flow over time. The heat flow was negative, \nsuggesting that the interaction between the SWP and chitosan was \nexothermic. Dong et al. (2015) have reported similar results. The SWP \nisotherm for chitosan titration showed high exothermic peaks at the \nbeginning, followed by a constant decrease in temperature over time. \nBecause coacervation between SWP and chitosan was primarily driven \nby negative enthalpy caused by electrostatic interactions. The observed \nincrease in the number of chitosan injections required to achieve satu-\nration during the titration of SWP confirming that the duration of CJ \npretreatment enhances the electrostatic attraction between SWP and \nchitosan. Table 1 displays thermodynamic parameters. These parame -\nters provided additional support for enthalpically favorable and entro -\npically unfavorable interactions between SWP and chitosan during the \nSWP/CH complexation process. The parameters of \u0394H also indicate that \nthe complexation of SWP and chitosan has a strong driving force. \nFurthermore, the complexation process is exothermic. \nThe KD values of the CJ-0 and CJ-180 groups were below 10-6. This \nindicates the significant strength of the interactions between the two \npolymers, because the complexes are deemed to possess a high affinity \nwhile KD values were below 10-6(Franca, Lins, Freitas, & Straatsma, \n2008 ). A negative \u0394G value indicates that the interactions between SWP \nand chitosan were consistently spontaneous, suggesting that the inter-\naction between SWP and chitosan follows the pattern of associative \nphase separation (Rabelo, Tavares, Prata, & Hubinger, 2019 ).

Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nFood Chemistry: X 21 (2024) 101122\n5complex coacervation between SWP and chitosan at various CJ pre-\ntreatment durations (0 and 180 s), an electrostatic interaction between \nthe two oppositely charged components produced most of the negative \nenthalpy (negative contribution to \u0394G) (Vuillemin, Michaux, Muniglia, \nLinder, & Jasniewski, 2019 ). The formation of SWP and chitosan com-\nplex involves electrostatic interactions that occur at a larger distance \nthan hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions (Grinberg & Tol-\nstoguzov, 1997 ). The denaturation of SWP induced by CJ pretreatment \nenables it to adapt to the charge density of chitosan by facilitating the \nformation of electrostatic complexes, which is accompanied by merging, \nfusion, or recombination of the complexes. This increased the enthalpy \nof the reaction system. Furthermore, the CJ pretreatment led to a posi-\ntive alteration in entropy and an enhancement in affinity. The presence of non-electrostatic interactions was manifested by a stronger binding \naffinity between SWP and chitosan, leading to a reduction in entropy \n(Bolel, Datta, Mahapatra, & Halder, 2012 ). Indeed, the CJ pretreatment \nenhances hydrophobic interactions by causing conformational changes \nin the SWP structure and releasing bound water and counterions into the \nbulk (Mu et al., 2022 ). The formation of hydrogen bonds was facilitated \nby the presence of glutamate as the SWP molecules were pulled together \nby electrostatic interactions. In contrast, with a CJ pretreatment time of \n180 s, the stabilizing intermolecular interactions in the SWP/CH system \nwere substituted by cooperative interactions between protein molecules \nalong the chitosan chain. This change occurred because of the disruption \nof the hydrogen bonding. The inclusion of all charges in the interactions \nof the SWP/CH complexes led to a decrease in randomness and an in-\ncrease in the order within the system (Du, Hong, Cheng, & Gu, 2022 ). In \naddition, during the 180 s CJ pretreatment, the ions from the SWP acted \nas a protective barrier and reduced the impact of electrostatic in-\nteractions on the charge of the polyelectrolytes in the solution. The \ncombination of SWP and chitosan exhibited a beneficial change in \nenthalpy (\u0394H D0), which is partly counteracted by an unfavorable \nchange in entropy (\u0394S D0). This compensation was linked to the \nequilibrium of SWP/CH electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, \nwhich play a pivotal role in the creation and maintenance of complex. \n3.3. Zeta potential \nThe zeta potential reflects the intensity of electrostatic repulsion or \nattraction particle surface of the SWP/CH complexes (Li, Xu, & Xu, \nFig 3.Thermograms (top panels) and binding isotherms (bottom panels) corresponding to the titration of the soy whey protein (SWP) solution with chitosan so-\nlution. Soy whey protein (SWP) was obtained from freeze-dried soy whey wastewater without cavitation jet pre-treatment (A) and freeze-dried soy whey wastewater \nafter cavitation jet pre-treatment for 180 s (B), respectively. \nTable 1 \nThermodynamic parameters of binding between soy whey protein (SWP was \nobtained by freeze-dried soy whey wastewater without cavitation jet pretreat -\nment which is named CJ-0 and freeze-dried soy whey wastewater after cavita -\ntion jet pre-treatment for 180 s which is named CJ-180, respectively) and \nchitosan (CH).  \nSamples N KD (M) \u0394G (kcal/ \nmol) \u0394H (kcal/ \nmol) -T\u0394S (kcal/ \nmol) \nCJ-0 3.40 \u00d7\n10-3 731 \u00d7\n10-9  \u00008.37  \u000056.60  48.23 \nCJ-180 4.71 \u00d7\n10-3 852 \u00d7\n10-9  -11.95  -63.64  51.69  C. Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nFood Chemistry: X 21 (2024) 101122\n62022 ). Therefore, the zeta potentials of the control and CJ-pretreated \nsynergistic chitosan groups were determined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the \nabsolute value of the zeta potential in the CJ-0 group was lower than \nthat of the Control. This may be because the positively charged chitosan \ninteracted with the negatively charged SWP via electrostatic in-\nteractions, and the binding strength between chitosan and SWP was \nhigher than that of ammonium sulfate, thus causing the zeta potential of \nCJ-0 to be lower than that of the Control. The absolute value of the zeta \npotential of the SWP/CH complexes first decreased and then increased \nwith increasing pretreatment time of CJ. When the pretreatment time of \nCJ was 180 s, the zeta potential reached its minimum value. This might \nbe because an appropriate CJ pretreatment can break the skeleton \nstructures of SWP and increase the flexible molecular structure and \nsurface area of SWP, thus exposing more charged groups and facilitating \nthe possibility of binding to SWP (Cheng et al., 2024 ). This change could \ncause the negative charge on the SWP surface to be neutralized by the \ngreater positive charge on the chitosan surface, thereby reducing the \nabsolute zeta potential of the SWP/CH complexes. This was also \nconfirmed from another perspective: chitosan enhanced the recovery \nrate of SWP through electrostatic interactions, which were related to the \npretreatment time of CJ. The results is agreed with those of previous \nstudies (Mounsey, O\u2019Kennedy, Fenelon, & Brodkorb, 2008 ). When the \npretreatment time of CJ is prolonged, cavitation and thermal effects can \nlead to the dissociation and aggregation of SWP, thereby destroying \nsome of the chitosan binding sites. This can lead to a decrease in the \nnumber of positively charged chitosan molecules bound to SWP and \nretention of exposed negatively charged amino acid residues, resulting \nin an increase in the absolute value of the zeta potential of SWP/CH \ncomplexes. \n3.4. Particle size distribution and turbidity \nThe particle size distribution and turbidity of the control and CJ- \npretreated chitosan groups are shown in Fig. 2 C and Table 2. The par-\nticle size and turbidity of the CJ group were higher than those of the \nControl due to the flocculation of SWP and chitosan. High turbidity in-\ndicates strong cohesion between SWP and chitosan (Amine, Boire, \nKermarrec, & Renard, 2019 ). The particle size and turbidity of the SWP/ \nCH complexes first decreased and then increased with increasing CJ \npretreatment time, with the CJ-180 group exhibiting the smallest par-\nticle size and turbidity. This is because the cavitation cleavage effect \nproduced by the appropriate CJ disperses SWP into small particles, \nwhich exposes more hydrophobic groups and can form small SWP/CH \ncomplexes via charge neutralization. Smaller SWP/CH complex were \nbetter dispersed in the water phase, thereby reducing the turbidity of the \nsolution. However, the change in the spatial structure of small SWP \nparticles caused by long-term cavitating jet pretreatment led to the \nreaggregation of the SWP. Strong hydrophobic and hydrogen bond in-\nteractions between the reaggregates of SWP led particle size increase \nand turbidity when combined with chitosan. The trend of PDI variation \nis similar to that of particle size variation, which may be because \neffective charge neutralization between SWP and CH is conducive to the formation of uniformly sized and distributed complexes (Zhang, Dong, \nGao, Chen, & Vasanthan, 2020 ). \n3.5. FTIR \nThe stretching of chemical bonds and conformational changes in the \nSWP/CH complexes were assessed by FTIR. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the \nspectra were almost identical and the addition of polysaccharides did \nnot cause new characteristic peaks to appear for CJ-0, indicating that the \nincorporation of chitosan did not induce additional covalent bonds in \nthe SWP/CH complexes. The characteristic peaks at 1575 \u20131480 cm\u00001 \nare mostly attributed to the C\u2013O stretching and N\u2013H bending of the \namide bonds (Wang, Yang, Du, & Chen, 2023 ). The characteristic peak \nintensity of CJ-0 significantly increased at 1536 cm\u00001, and the charac -\nteristic peak intensity changed with increasing CJ pretreatment time. \nThe blue shift of the peak in the spectrum at about 2932 cm\u00001 and 842 \ncm\u00001 corresponds to the stretching vibration of \u2013CH2 and the defor -\nmation vibration of \u2013CH. This is caused by the vibration of hydrogen \nbond interaction between SWP and chitosan (Mohammadian & Mada -\ndlou, 2016 ). The characteristic peaks of FTIR spectroscopy at 2962 cm\u00001 \ncorrespond to the stretching vibration of hydrophobic C\u2013H. However, \nthe shapes and intensities of the CJ-0 and CJ-60 to CJ-300 samples were \naltered to a certain degree, suggesting the existence of hydrophobic \ninteractions within the SWP/CH complexes. \nAs shown in Table 3, chitosan and CJ pretreatment times signifi -\ncantly changed the composition of protein secondary structures in SWP. \nCompared with SWP, the \u03b2-turn and random coil content of the SWP/CH \ncomplexes decreased, and \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet content increased. These \nresults suggested that the noncovalent binding of SWP to chitosan pro-\nmoted the conversion of \u03b2-turn regions and random coil regions to \n\u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet regions, and the increase in \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet \ncontent also indicated that the structure of SWP/CH complex became \nmore compact (Gao et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, with an increase in the \nCJ pretreatment time from 60 s to 300 s, the \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet of the \nSWP/CH complexes first decreased and then increased, and the \u03b2-turn \nand random coil increased first and then decreased. When the CJ pre-\ntreatment time was 180 s, the \u03b1-helix content of SWP/CH complex was \nthe lowest. In protein secondary structures, \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets of \nproteins are considered ordered structures (Xue et al., 2022 ). The \ncavitation bubbles render the SWP structure looser and more stretched, \nand the ordered structures are converted into disordered structures (Guo \net al., 2023 ). This structure promoted the interaction between SWP and \nchitosan, thus more chitosan molecules were bound. Furthermore, the \nexcessive pretreatment time of CJ would cause the protein aggregation, \nthus increasing the \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet content. \n3.6. Surface hydrophobicity \nSurface hydrophobicity measurements were conducted to assess al-\nterations in the stability and conformation of the SWP/CH complexes \n(Zhan et al., 2019 ), which affect their functionality of SWP/CH \nTable 2 \nPolymer dispersity index (PDI) and turbidity of the Control, CJ-0, CJ-60, CJ-120, \nCJ-180, CJ-240 and CJ-300.  \nSamples PDI Turbidity \nControl 0.45 \u00b10.02a 0.24 \u00b10.02ab \nCJ-0 0.47 \u00b10.04a 0.27\u00b10.01a \nCJ-60 0.43 \u00b10.05ab 0.22\u00b10.02b \nCJ-120 0.39 \u00b10.01bc 0.18\u00b10.01c \nCJ-180 0.37 \u00b10.01c 0.14\u00b10.02d \nCJ-240 0.38 \u00b10.06bc 0.18\u00b10.01c \nCJ-300 0.35 \u00b10.02c 0.19\u00b10.01c \nNote: Different lowercase letters in the same column mean significant differ -\nences at p D0.05 between different samples.

C. Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nFood Chemistry: X 21 (2024) 101122\n7complexes. As shown in Fig. 2E, the surface hydrophobicity of the CJ- \n0 group was higher than that of the Control. This suggests that the ter-\ntiary structure of SWP undergoes changes in the presence of chitosan, \nthus changing the hydrophobic forces (Song, Zhong, Sun, Li, & Qi, \n2023 ). The surface hydrophobicity of the SWP/CH complexes first \nincreased and then decreased with increasing CJ pretreatment time, and \nthe surface hydrophobicity of CJ-180 was the highest. This is because \nthe high-pressure shear effect of the CJ weakens the intramolecular \nforces of SWP, which induces the unfolding of SWP and the extension of \nthe noncovalent bonds of the SWP molecules, thereby exposing the \nhydrophobic groups buried in the SWP (Man et al., 2023 ). CJ pretreat -\nment and the presence of chitosan together led to an increase in the \nsurface hydrophobicity of the SWP/CH complexes. The surface hydro -\nphobicity of the SWP/CH complexes decreased when the CJ pretreat -\nment time exceeded 180 s. This may have been due to the cavitation and \nshear stress generated by excessive CJ, which caused intermolecular \nhydrophobic aggregation of SWP and a decrease in the amount of \nbinding with chitosan, thus reducing the surface hydrophobicity of the \nSWP/CH complexes. \n3.7. Protein solubility \nSolubility characterizes the degree of protein denaturation and ag-\ngregation and affects many functional properties of proteins. As shown \nin Fig. 2 F, the solubility of the CJ-0 group was significantly higher than that of the Control. This is because the addition of CH and introduction \nof a large number of hydroxyl groups into the complex increased the \nsolubility of the SWP/CH complexes. The solubility of the SWP/CH \ncomplexes first increased and then decreased with increasing CJ pre-\ntreatment time, with the highest solubility observed in CJ-180 s. The \nintense disruptive forces caused by CJ could effectively break down \nlarger protein particles into smaller ones and increase the specific sur-\nface area to bind with more chitosan, which further enhanced the SWP/ \nwater and SWP/CH interactions, thus leading to increased solubility of \nthe SWP/CH complexes (Sliwinski, Roubos, Zoet, van Boekel, & Wout -\ners, 2003 ). However, prolonged CJ can cause protein molecules to \nexpand, exposing hydrophobic groups. The SWP molecules formed \nmacromolecular aggregates through noncovalent interactions, burying \nthe binding sites with chitosan, which resulted in a decrease in the \nsolubility of the SWP/CH complexes. \n3.8. Emulsifying capacity \n3.8.1. EAI and ESI \nThe emulsifying properties serve as metrics to assess the capacity of \nemulsifiers to stabilize emulsions at the O/W interface, as quantified by \nEAI and ESI. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the EAI and ESI of CJ-0 increased \nsignificantly compared with those of the Control because the in-\nteractions between SWP and chitosan could lead to the exposure of \nhydrophobic residues outside the protein molecule, which were \nFig 4.Emulsifying activity (EAI) and emulsifying stability (ESI) (A), Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM, Scale bar \u0088150 \u03bcm) (B), Adsorbed protein per-\ncentage (AP %) (C) of the Control, CJ-0, CJ-60, CJ-120, CJ-180, CJ-240 and CJ-300. Different capital letters and lowercase letters mean significant differences at p D\n0.05 between different samples. C. Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nFood Chemistry: X 21 (2024) 101122\n8absorbed onto the O/W interface, improving the stability of the emul -\nsion (Wang et al., 2019 ). The EAI and ESI of the SWP/CH complexes \nexhibited an initial increase, followed by a decline as the pretreatment \ntime of CJ increased, suggesting that appropriate pretreatment of CJ was \nfavorable for forming an O/W emulsion. Appropriate pretreatment with \nCJ might increase the intermolecular electrostatic repulsion and hy-\ndrophobic interactions of SWP and accelerate the adsorption of chitosan \nonto SWP, thereby allowing SWP/CH complexes to adsorb and rear-\nrange more quickly at the oil/water interface, ultimately enhancing EAI \nand ESI (Kato, 2002 ). However, the excessive pretreatment of CJ may \nlead to the decrease of EAI and ESI of SWP/CH complex, potentially \nattributed to the diminished surface hydrophobicity. The lower surface \nhydrophobicity increased the energy required for the SWP/CH com-\nplexes to adsorb onto the oil\u2013water interface, hindering the adsorption \nof SWP/CH complexes and the formation of dense interfacial protein \nmembranes (de Oliveira, Coimbra, de Oliveira, Zu~niga, & Rojas, 2016 ). \n3.8.2. CLSM \nThe CLSM results for the emulsions prepared with SWP/CH com-\nplexes were shown in Fig. 4 B. The SWP/CH complexes were dyed green \nand formed a shell structure on the outside of the oil droplets, whereas \nthe oil phase was dyed red and wrapped inside. Control (Fig. 4 B Control \nc) sample was observed that SWP was dispersed in the lotion phase, and \nonly a small amount was adsorbed on the surface of oil droplets. The \nlotion drops are spherical with uneven size distribution. As the pre-\ntreatment time of CJ increased, the surface of oil droplets (Fig. 4 B CJ- \n60c, CJ-120c, CJ-180c) is enveloped by SWP/chitosan complexes due \nto their \u201cshell \u201d state (Fig. 4 B CJ-120 a, CJ-180 a). The appropriate CJ \npretreatment could reduce the particle size of SWP and cause SWP to \nadsorb more chitosan to form smaller SWP/CH complexes. The presence \nof chitosan can produce an osmotic driving force, thereby reducing the \ninterfacial tension and enhancing the amphiphilicity of the SWP/CH \ncomplexes. This helped it better adsorb at the oil\u2013water interface and \nform a stable and thick protein adsorption layer to stabilize emulsion \ndroplets of smaller particle sizes (Xie et al., 2023 ). After prolonged \npretreatment with CJ, the droplets size increased accompanied with \nirregular spherical. The SWP/CH complexes with large particle sizes \nproduced by the excessive pretreatment time of CJ had lower surface \nhydrophobicity, thereby inhibiting adsorption at the oil\u2013water interface. \nIn addition, SWP/CH complexes with large particle sizes exhibit rela-\ntively high vacancy resistance and electrostatic repulsion, making pro-\ntein film formation difficult. Consequently, large aggregates of emulsion \ndroplets are formed, causing emulsion instability. This is why it is \nimportant to consider the appropriate pretreatment time in order to \nreduce the particle size of the SWP/CH complexes. \n3.8.3. Adsorbed protein percentage (AP%) \nTo better understand the interfacial properties of the emulsion, the \nadsorbed protein percentage (AP %) was measured and used as an in-\ndicator of interfacial protein adsorption capacity (Wang, Wang, Dai, Yu, \n& Cheng, 2023 ). The AP% of the control and SWP/CH complexes after \ndifferent CJ pretreatment times are shown in Fig. 4 C. Compared with \nthe control, the AP% of CJ-0 was significantly increased. This may be \ndue to the formation of soluble complex between SWP and chitosan, \nwhich can increase the AP content at the interface (Huang et al., 2023 ). \nWith increasing CJ pretreatment time, the AP% content showed an \nincreasing trend, followed by a slight decrease. The AP% content was \nhighest when the CJ pretreatment time was 180 s. This result proved \nthat CJ pretreatment promoted the adsorption of SWP/CH complexes on \nthe oil\u2013water surface. CJ pretreatment reduced the particle size of SWP \nand promoted the binding of SWP with chitosan, which led to greater \nthermodynamic incompatibility between SWP and chitosan, thus pro-\nmoting the diffusion and adsorption of the protein to the interface and \nmaking it easier to rearrange at the oil\u2013water interface (Bergfreund, \nBertsch, & Fischer, 2021 ). When the CJ pretreatment time was increased \nto 300 s, the AP% slightly decreased. Excessive pretreatment time of CJ could lead to the phenomenon of \u201coverprocessing, \u201d and the formation of \ncomplex systems of larger particles and fewer hydrophobic groups \nwould be unfavorable for adsorption of SWP/CH complexes. Simulta -\nneously, the reduction in the hydrophobic point of the SWP/CH complex \nleads to a decrease in the intermolecular connections among proteins. \nThis decrease in protein particle adhesion onto the oil\u2013water surface \nconsequently results in a reduction in the AP% value. \n4.Conclusion \nIn this study, SWP was recovered by using CJ pretreatment combined \nwith chitosan. The proper CJ pretreatment of soy whey wastewater is \nbeneficial for the binding of chitosan and SWP, thereby the recovery rate \nof SWP increased. Afterwards, we analyzed the binding mechanisms and \nemulsifying capacity of SWP/CH complexes. The FTIR and ITC results \nindicated that SWP and chitosan mainly bind through non covalent in-\nteractions, with electrostatic interactions being the most important. In \naddition. The SWP/CH complexes obtained by proper CJ pretreatment \nhad a smaller particle size distribution and higher surface hydropho -\nbicity, which was conducive to their adsorption on the oil\u2013water inter-\nface, thus stabilizing the emulsion. While CJ pretreatment time was 180 \ns, the ability of SWP/CH compound to stabilize emulsion reaches the \nmaximum. However, the obtained results could be affected by the \nvariability in the composition of raw material (soy whey wastewater) \nand chitosan commercial samples, which can exhibit different density \ncharges and molecular weights. Therefore, it is necessary to further \nstudy the interaction mechanism between protein structure changes and \npolysaccharides with different density, charge and molecular weight, so \nas to better play the role of cavitating jet technology in the treatment of \nfood industry wastewater. \nFunding \nThis research was funded by the \u201c14th Five-Year Plan \u201d National Key \nR&D Program of China (2021YFD2100400), the Heilongjiang Province \n\u201cHundreds and Thousands \u201d Engineering Science and Technology Major \nProject (2021ZX12B02), the Shandong Province Major R&D Project \n(2022CXGC010603). \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nCaihua Liu: Writing \u2013 original draft, Conceptualization.
