Sixty-one subjects were\nrandomized 1:1 to placebo or treatment for the first six months; all received active treatment the subsequent six months.The primary outcome was change in the modified Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (MHFMS) score following sixmonths of treatment. Secondary outcomes included safety and adverse event data, and change in MHFMS score for twelve\nversus six months of active treatment, body composition, quantitative SMN mRNA levels, maximum ulnar CMAP amplitudes,\nmyometry and PFT measures.\nResults: At 6 months, there was no difference in change from the baseline MHFMS score between treatment and placebo\ngroups (difference = 0.643, 95% CI = 21.22\u20132.51). Adverse events occurred in .80% of subjects and were more common in\nthe treatment group. Excessive weight gain was the most frequent drug-related adverse event, and increased fat mass was\nnegatively related to change in MHFMS values (p = 0.0409). Post-hoc analysis found that children ages two to three yearsthat received 12 months treatment, when adjusted for baseline weight, had significantly improved MHFMS scores (p = 0.03)compared to those who received placebo the first six months. A linear regression analysis limited to the influence of age\ndemonstrates young age as a significant factor in improved MHFMS scores (p = 0.007).\nConclusions: This study demonstrated no benefit from six months treatment with VPA and L-carnitine in a young non-\nambulatory cohort of subjects with SMA. Weight gain, age and treatment duration were significant confounding variablesthat should be considered in the design of future trials.\nTrial Registry: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00227266\nCitation: Swoboda KJ, Scott CB, Crawford TO, Simard LR, Reyna SP, et al.

[1\u20136] More than 95% of affected individuals demon-\nstrate a homozygous deletion/mutation involving exon 7 in SMN1\n(survival motor neuron 1), resulting in the biochemical deficiency\nof the SMN protein, part of a complex that functions in the\nassembly of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP).\n[7,8] A genomic duplication at this locus has produced a nearly\nidentical gene, SMN2 (survival motor neuron 2) that differs from\nSMN1 by a nucleotide substitution that promotes exon 7 exclusion,\nthus producing only a fraction of the identical full length protein.\nPhenotypic variation in SMA correlates with the number of SMN2\ngene copies and the level of SMN protein in cells [9\u201315].\nBecause all SMA patients have 1 or more SMN2 gene copies,\nsmall molecule compounds that target SMN2 to produce increased\nquantities of full-length SMN protein from the existing SMN2\ngene(s) are attractive therapeutic candidates. Valproic acid (VPA),\na histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, directly increases SMN\nexpression in SMA patient-derived cell lines in vitro. [16,17]\nPreliminary in vivo data in humans demonstrates up-regulation of\nSMN2 expression in about one-third of SMA subjects via\ninhibition of HDAC2 and also appears to alter splicing to increase\nSMN7 inclusion and thus full-length SMN protein. [18,19] VPA\nhas also been demonstrated to have neuroprotective properties on\nglutamate-induced excitotoxicity via up-regulation of alpha-\nsynuclein and increases neurite outgrowth in vitro. [20,21] VPA\ntreatment has been demonstrated to increase survival in animal\nmodels of motor neuron disease including amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis and SMA. [22\u201324] In an SMA mouse model, VPAtreatment resulted in improved gross motor function, larger\nevoked motor potentials, less degeneration of spinal motor neurons\nand improved neuromuscular junction innervation in treated\nanimals compared to age-matched controls [24]. Three open label\ntrials of VPA in human subjects have been published to date, all\nindicating a possible modest benefit in strength and/or motor\nfunction [25\u201327].\nAs children with SMA may have a limited carnitine synthetic\ncapacity due to significantly diminished skeletal muscle mass, and\nVPA is known to inhibit carnitine transport and deplete carnitine\nlevels by binding to VPA metabolites, we elected to combine VPA\ntherapy with sufficient supplemental carnitine to avoid concerns\nabout a confounding effect of carnitine depletion. This decision\nwas influenced by data from our open label VPA trial, which\nindicated an increased suspectibility in SMA subjects to carnitine\ndepletion with VPA treatment [27].\nOur primary objective was to assess potential benefit for\nimproving motor function in a young non-ambulatory cohort of\nchildren with SMA in a randomized double-blind placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trial. Additional objectives were to further\nassess the safety of VPA in children with SMA, to assess\nperformance of selected outcome measures for use in a multi-\ncenter clinical trials setting and to look for evidence that would\nsupport a biologic effect of VPA in these subjects, such as changes\nin SMN expression, electrophysiologic outcomes, or both.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nWritten informed parental consent (subjects ,18 years) and\nassent (subjects $7 years) were obtained for all subjects. The study\nwas approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review\nBoard (IRB) and at each participating clinical trial site (Universityof Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences; Wayne State University;\nOhio State Biomedical; Johns Hopkins Medical and Ste JustineHospital.\nTrial Design\nThe SMA CARNI-VAL trial was a multi-center phase II trial of\nCARNItine and VALproic acid in patients with spinal muscular\natrophy. This trial consisted of two parallel multi-center studies,targeting different SMA cohorts (Clinicaltrials.gov IDNCT00227266). The protocol for this trial and supportingCONSORT checklist are available as supporting information;see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1. Part 1 was a prospective doubleblind, placebo-controlled randomized intention-to-treat protocolto assess safety and efficacy of VPA and L-carnitine in non-ambulatory SMA type II or III \u2018\u2018sitters\u2019\u2019 2\u20138 years of age (cohort1). Part 2 was a parallel open label trial in SMA type II or III\u2018\u2018standers and walkers\u2019\u2019 3\u201317 years of age (cohort 2). In this paper,we review objectives, methods and results only for Part 1.\nStudy population\nWe prospectively enrolled 61 non-ambulatory SMA children at\nsix centers in North America. The progress of all participantsthrough the trial is diagrammed in Figure 1. Inclusion andexclusion criteria are indicated in Figure 2.\nStudy procedures\nAll subjects completed two baseline visits within a two to six\nweek period. Following the second visit, subjects were randomizedto either the placebo arm (group 1) or the treatment arm (group 2).There were 31 subjects randomized to the placebo arm and 30subjects randomized to the active treatment arm (Figure 1).\nPlacebo was provided for both L-carnitine and VPA. Subjects and\ninvestigators remained blinded for the duration of the study. At thesix-month visit, subjects in group 1 were switched to activetreatment for the second six-month period, and those in group 2continued on study medication for an additional 6 months. Thus,half of the children received treatment for the last 6 months of thestudy, and half received active treatment for the full 12 months.This trial design was intended to improve trial enrollment andcompliance with the protocol, as focus group discussions withparents of eligible children indicated significant reluctance toenroll in a trial of a licensed drug in which there was a 50% chanceof receiving only placebo. Nonetheless, extension of the trial to 12months in this manner was thought to be potentially useful tostudy both the benefit, and burden, of longer treatment duration.\nAbbott Pharmaceutical provided VPA and placebo, and Sigma-\nTau Pharmaceutical provided L-carnitine, at no cost. Divalproex\nsodium coated particles (Depakote Hsprinkle capsules, 125 mg) or\nmatched placebo was administered in divided doses two to threetimes daily sufficient to maintain overnight trough levels of 50\u2013100 mg/dL. L-carnitine (or matched placebo, 100 mg/ml liquid)was dosed at 50 mg/kg/day, to a maximum of 1000 mg, dividedinto two daily doses.\nTreatment assessments were performed at 3 (V1), 6 (V2) and 12\n(V3) months. Laboratories were performed at baseline, 2\u20133 weeksfollowing initiation, at each treatment visit and midway betweenV2 and V3 visits, and included a basic chemistry profile, CBCwith platelets, transaminases, carnitine profile, amylase, lipase andtrough VPA levels. An un-blinded medical monitor, who alsoreviewed subjects\u2019 blood tests and adverse events, performeddosing adjustments. Similar adjustments were made for subjects in\nthe placebo group to preserve blinded status of participants.\nContact was possible between the unblinded medical monitor andSMA CARNI-VAL Trial Part I\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e12140\npatients if required by clinical concerns, but efforts were taken to\navoid unblinding of the site investigator, parents and patient.\nOutcome measures\nPrimary outcome measures included laboratory safety data,\nadverse event data and efficacy as measured by change from baseline\nModified Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (MHFMS) scores\nfollowing six months of treatment versus placebo. Secondaryoutcome measures included change from baseline MHFMS scorefollowing 12 versus 6 months treatment, estimates of innervation viamaximum ulnar compound muscle action potential (CMAP), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), evaluation of body compo-sition and bone density, quantitative assessment of SMN mRNA;\nevaluation of quality of life using the Pediatric Quality of Life\nInventory (PedsQL) and for children five years and older, changefrom baseline measures of pulmonary function and muscle strengthvia handheld myometry at 6 and 12 months.\nGross motor function was assessed with the MHFMS. This scale\nwas previously modified for use in a research setting but contains\nthe same 20 gross motor function items as the original clinical scale(complete protocol available at http://smaoutcomes.org). [28\u201329]Degree of innervation by the ulnar nerve in the hypothenar musclegroup of the hand was estimated using maximum ulnarCMAP amplitude (complete CMAP protocol available at http://smaoutcomes.org). In children five years and older, myometry\nFigure 1. Consort flow diagram.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.g001\nFigure 2.

[30,31] If anymeasure was more than 10% different than any of the other two\nmeasurements, then a fourth measurement was performed. The\nsummary statistic was the average of either three or fourmeasurements taken during a visit for both the right and leftelbow and knee. [32\u201334] In children five years and older,pulmonary function testing (PFT) was performed in an accreditedpediatric laboratory and included forced vital capacity (FVC),forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and maximumexpiratory and inspiratory pressures (MEP, MIP). Dual-energy X-\nray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning for bone density and body\ncomposition was performed at the Salt Lake City, Madison andColumbus sites. Norland DEXA XR-36 software version 3.3.1 forsmall subjects was used to assess whole body composition and bonemineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC). Qualityof life (QOL) was assessed using the PedsQL [35]. The sameparent completed the PedsQL at each visit and children five years\nof age and older completed the age-appropriate PedsQL. The\nquestionnaire is scored on a 0 to 100 scale such that a higher scoreindicates better QOL.\nSMN2 copy number was determined as previously described.\n[11] Whole blood was drawn into PAXgene tubes at baseline andeach visit and quantitation of full length SMN (flSMN) and\nSMND7 mRNA transcripts was performed as previously de-\nscribed. [27,36] Human RPLPO (large ribosomal protein) andPGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) were run as endogenouscontrols. Subjects missing baseline data or who had incompletevisit data were excluded from this analysis. Results are reported asrelative amounts of flSMN or SMN D7 transcripts normalized\nagainst the relative amount of RPLPO.Table 1.

Study coordinators also reviewed medical recordsfor emergency room or hospital visits. Adverse events were gradedusing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0(CTCAE v3.0). An independent Data and Safety MonitoringCommittee provided oversight for the study.\nStatistical Analysis\nA prior open-label study of SMA type 2 subjects showed the\nstandard deviation for MHFMS-SMA was 3.19. [27] A clinically\nmeaningful change was estimated to be a 3 point change inMHFMS-SMA at 6 months. A sample size of 25 subjectscompleting both the baseline and six-month evaluations providedat least 90% statistical power with an effect size of 0.941, Type Ierror of 0.05 (two-sided). Assuming 20% attrition then 60 totalsubjects were required. Subjects were randomized using apermuted block design with blocks of size 6 with no stratification.The statistician for the study (author CS) created a blindedrandomization list using the permuted block algorithm. At thesecond screening visit the site determines whether the subject waseligible, then completed a randomization request form that was\nfaxed to one of the authors (CS) who would assign the subject per\nthe predetermined randomization list. The treatment assignmentwas then sent to the central pharmacy to dispense the studymedication. The statistician was blinded to treatment assignment,as was the study coordinator, treating investigator, patient andparents.\nThe assumption of normality for continuous variables was\nexamined using the Shapiro-Wilks tests. Fisher\u2019s exact test was\nused to compare treatment groups in the analysis of categoricalvariables (e.g., gender). Baseline demographics and function were\nanalyzed as continuous variables with treatment groups comparedusing a t-test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used tocompare treatment groups for change from baseline data whenTable 3.

If the\ndata were not normally distributed then the Wilcoxon rank-sum\ntest was used (e.g., change in BMD). Linear regression analysis was\nused to examine baseline characteristics, potential prognostic\nfactors for normally distributed outcome variables. The Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient, calculated from the linear regression, was\nused to assess association between continuous variables. Longitu-\ndinal analysis was performed using generalized estimating\nequations. When the data were normally distributed the identity\nlink function was used and unstructured correlation. We used thesmall sample adjustment to the Score test, J/(J-1) where J is the\nnumber of clusters [37] When both random and fixed effects were\nanalyzed, a mixed effect longitudinal analysis was performed. A p-\nvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nReliability of the MHFMS in this group of subjects was evaluated\nusing the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). This was used to\ndetermine the reliability across evaluators at different sites.\nAll analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat population\nthat was defined as all subjects randomized to receive study\nmedication. There were 61 subjects randomized, 4 subjects did not\nhave a 6-month data: 2 of these dropped out after the 3-month\nvisit, the other 2 missed their 6-month visit due to illness. At 12\nmonths the 2 subjects missing the 6 month visit returned. MHFMS\nwas not performed in one additional patient at 6 months. At 12-\nmonths one had a missing MHFMS. No data imputation was\nperformed. CMAP was not performed according to protocol at 2\nof the clinical sites accounting for 17 missing values. Parent-proxy\nQOL was not collected at the 6 month visit in 3 subjects.\nResults\nRecruitment began in September 2005 and enrollment of the\nlast subject was completed in October of 2006. The last subjects\u2019\nfinal visit was in November 2007, and database was locked in\nMarch 2008. Participant flow is outlined in figure 1.\nBaseline Characteristics of Study Population\nThe analysis of demographic data (Table 1) indicates that the 2\ntreatments were well balanced for most factors. More males wereenrolled in the placebo group (64.5%) and more females were\nenrolled in the treatment group (56.7%) but overall, there was no\nstatistical difference (p = , 0.126). Body Mass Index (BMI)\nassessments indicated no significant difference between treatment\narms (Supplemental Table S1). Total body BMD, BMC, lean mass\nand fat mass prior to the start of treatment were assessed via\nDEXA scans performed at three sites (Supplemental Table S2).\nBaseline pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in subjects five years of\nage and older and baseline CMAP values were equivalent across\ngroups (Supplemental Tables S3 and S4). Myometry data from\nchildren five years of age and older indicated that upper extremity\nstrength was greater in the placebo group (Supplemental Table S5,\np#.03), but lower extremity myometry data demonstrated no\ndifference between groups. The PedsQL parent assessment\nindicates no statistical difference between the placebo and\ntreatment group on any of the subscales, psychosocial or total\nQOL (Supplemental Table S6). Only a subset of subjects was ableto complete their own PedsQL (Supplemental Table S7).\nReliability of the primary efficacy outcome measure,\nMHFMS-SMA, during the screening period\nWe used the ICC to determine the reliability of MHFMS from\nthe first screening visit to the second, rated within their institution.\nEvaluating all subjects, the reliability is 0.97. The reliability at each\ninstitution was excellent and similar to the reliability previously\nreported (0.95\u20130.99). [27,29]\nPrimary efficacy outcome\nImpact of treatment on gross motor function as\nmeasured via MHFMS. The primary endpoint was change\nfrom baseline in the MHFMS score at 6 months. The distribution\nof the change from baseline data was normally distributed. There\nwas no difference in change from baseline at 6 months between\nplacebo and treatment groups (p = 0.492, Table 2). A linear\nregression analysis for the change from baseline to 6 months of theMHFMS, including age at study entry and treatment group as\nindependent variables, indicates that age has a borderline effect on\nchange (p = 0.0564), but treatment was not significant at\nFigure 3.

The coefficient for age is -0.47 (SE 0.238) indicating\nthat as age increases the change in MHFMS decreases. Thus,subjects that were older at the start of the study had less of anincrease in scores than younger subjects. Gender was examined asa possible independent variable but was excluded from the model(p = 0.92).\nDuring the last six months, starting from V2, all subjects\nreceived active treatment. There was no statistical difference in thechange from baseline between the two groups; however, forsubjects on treatment for the entire 12 months, there was a smallincrease in the MHFMS score compared to baseline (Table 3,p = 0.185). Based upon the indication that age had a negativerelationship on MHFMS change over time, we investigatedsplitting the subjects into two groups: over age three years andunder age three years. Generalized estimating equations were usedto examine the change from baseline MHFMS score over a 12month period in children ages two to three years of age (n = 23).There was a negative effect of baseline weight over the 12 month\ninterval (estimate = 20.81, p = 0.0066) but a positive effect of\ntreatment over that period (estimate = 1.21, p = 0.03). Analysis of\nchildren three years of age and older (n = 33) demonstrated asimilar negative weight effect (estimate = 20.16, p = 0.0005)\nwithout the apparent treatment effect (p = 0.153). Table 4 displaysthe change from baseline in MHFMS within each age group bytreatment arm. Subjects two to three years of age in the treatmentgroup have an increasing slope through each visit, indicating atreatment benefit, while no such effect was observed in childrengreater than 3 years.\nAncillary analyses\nImpact of weight, BMI and body composition on primary\nmotor outcomes. The BMI z-score and BMI percent were\nadjusted for subject age. BMI, BMI z-score and BMI percent wereavailable at each follow-up visit. A generalized estimating equationanalysis of change from baseline MHFMS indicated thatincreasing BMI over the year of study was negatively associatedwith outcome. BMI was treated as a time-varying covariate inthe generalized estimating equation model. As BMI increasedover time, change in MHFMS decreased (estimate = 20.05,\np,0.0001). Linear regression analysis indicated that a change in\nfat mass as measured by DEXA is negatively related to a change inMHFMS (p = 0.0409). As fat mass increases by the 6-month time-point, MHFMS decreases. Figure 3 presents the change frombaseline fat mass versus the baseline fat mass by treatment armfrom the three sites that obtained DEXA measurements. BMIpercent based upon z-score correlated well with baseline fat mass\n(correlation = 0.475, p = 0.0004). A regression analysis indicates\nthat as weight at baseline increases, change from baselineMHFMS score worsens (p = 0.0058).\nImpact of treatment on bone density. The change in total\nbody BMD and BMC at 6 months was not normally distributed.Table 5.

As subjects get\nolder, their weight increases, and the relationship between weightand age causes a multi-colinearity problem in the analysis.However, linear regression analysis of change in MHFMS and\nage as the only independent predictor indicated that age isstatistically significant at p = 0.0069. The coefficient for age is\n20.62 (SE 0.219) indicating that as age increases the change in\nMHFMS score decreases.\nImpact of treatment on electrophysiologic measures of\ninnervation. There was no significant change in CMAP\nnegative peak amplitude or area measurements betweentreatment groups after 6 months (Table 5). However, there was\na good correlation between maximum CMAP amplitude and our\nprimary outcome measure, the MHFMS (figure 4).\nImpact of treatment on quality of life outcome\nassessments. Quality of life was measured using the PedsQL.\nThere were no statistically significant differences between\ntreatment groups for the parent-proxy QOL at 6 months\n(Table 6). The parent-proxy total QOL was compared tosignificant change (3 point change) in MHFMS at 6 months.\nTotal QOL did not improve as MHFMS improved, but there was\nevidence of deterioration in QOL as MHFMS declined (Table 7).\nImpact of treatment on myometry measurements.\nMyometry was assessed in fifteen subjects at least 5 years of agewhose assessments were not limited by contractures. Tables 8 and\n9 present the 6 month and change from baseline data for upper\nand lower extremity strength assessments. There were nostatistically significant differences between the two treatment\ngroups (Table 10).\nAt 12 months, there were no statistically significant differences\nbetween groups initially assigned to placebo or to treatment. In the\ngroup receiving treatment for the full year, there was no continual\nimprovement over the second six-month treatment period (datanot shown). A generalized estimating equation model indicatesthat there is no period by arm effect (p = 0.73) and no BMI effect\n(p = 0.7983).\nImpact of treatment on pulmonary function. PFTs were\nperformed only in subjects five years of age and older (n = 24), thus\nlimiting the power to observe any relationship with treatment.Treatment was not associated with changes in any of the PFT\noutcomes over the treatment period (data not shown).\nImpact of treatment on quantitative measures of SMN\nmRNA in whole blood. Results of mRNA analysis at 6 months\nare in Table 11. There was no difference in actual baseline values\nor change from baseline values between the 2 treatment groups at\n6 months. In addition, no difference was apparent betweentreatment groups through 12 months for either flSMN or D7\nSMN. A mixed effect model analysis over the entire year indicated\nthat baseline flSMN was highly predictive of flSMN at one year\n(p,0.0001), indicating very little change in flSMN. The\ncorrelation between D7 SMN baseline and D7 SMN at one year\nwas less than flSMN, but still highly significant (p ,0.0001). The\nminimal change over time and lack of correlation with baselinefunction provides little indication of a relationship between these\nmRNA parameters and outcome measures.Table 6.

A detailed listing of all adverse eventsduring the treatment phase is presented in Supplemental Table S8.Gastrointestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms were more\nfrequent in the treatment group. Four subjects (13%) on active\ntreatment had a severe adverse event, most commonly pneumonia(Table 13). Treatment-related adverse events were nearly equalbetween groups. There was no pattern in the placebo group, whilegastrointestinal AE were the most common in the treatment group.\nOverall adverse events for the entire 12- month period in each\ntreatment group are presented in Supplemental Table S9.\nDiscussion\nWe chose to perform a placebo-controlled study of VPA in non-\nambulatory children with SMA based on encouraging preliminary\nobservations of improved motor function during an open labelstudy [27]. Our choice to target children ages 2\u20138 years reflected acompromise between concerns regarding the lower limit of agewhere reliable assessment of motor function was possible versus\nconcerns that improvement in older children may be constrained\nby other factors that would confound assessment of an SMN-enhanced treatment effect. A combined treatment regimen of VPAand carnitine was selected to avoid a potential confounding effectof carnitine depletion, because we had previously demonstrated an\napparent susceptibility for more rapid depletion of carnitine with\nVPA treatment in this population. [27] Overall, enrollment wastargeted towards a more homogeneous younger cohort of subjectswho theoretically might be more likely to respond to therapy.\nWe did not detect a statistically significant improvement after\nsix months of treatment in our primary outcome measure - thechange in overall gross motor function assessed with the MHFMS.In addition, we did not detect a significant change in secondaryendpoints of strength and function, which included assessment ofmaximum upper and lower extremity strength via hand-held\nmyometry and PFTs. Adverse event frequency, although not\nstatistically different between groups, was somewhat higher in the\ntreatment group, particularly with regard to gastrointestinal andrespiratory symptoms. Although we did not observe any clinical or\nlaboratory evidence of serious hematologic or hepatic toxicity in\nthis study, excessive weight gain was clearly more prevalent in the\nactive treatment group. DEXA measurements confirmed that the\nassociated weight gain was due largely to an increase in total bodyfat mass in the absence of an increase in lean mass.\nGiven the increased fat mass in the treatment group compared\nto the placebo group during the phase 1 period, it is notable that\nwe did not observe a decline in gross motor function in the\ntreatment group as a whole. As in the open label study [27], weight\ngain was not uniform across the population. Non-ambulatory\nsubjects greater than five years of age, and those having a higherBMI at baseline, were at greatest risk. Children with the greatest\nimprovement in gross motor function as assessed by the MHFMS\ngained less fat mass than did those with stable or worsening\nMHFMS scores. The fact that the MHFMS did not decline in\nlight of substantial weight gain in the active treatment groupsuggests that VPA may indeed have a modest yet measurable\nbiologic effect that is outweighed by its confounding effect of\nweight gain. Increases in fat mass may not always be deleterious in\nthis population, where both over- and under-nourished states areTable 10.

Some children may benefit from the improved\nnutritional intake stimulated by an effect of VPA on appetite,\nperhaps putting them into a more favorable anabolic state.\nHowever, in other cases, due to increased gastrointestinalsymptoms related to VPA and/or L-carnitine, weight loss could\nbe a negative confounding factor.\nAlthough no treatment effect was detected in the primary\noutcome measure as assessed by the MHFMS, a post hoc analysisdemonstrated a statistically significant benefit in the youngest\ncohort of children, those two to three years of age. In addition,\nindividuals who received the active treatment over a full year\nshowed modestly improved function, gaining just over 2 points on\nthe MHFMS, although this did not reach statistical or obvious\nfunctional significance. Age proved to be a significant factor as to\nwhether or not subjects demonstrated an increase in MHFMS\nscores in association with treatment. We have previously\ndemonstrated that increased age is associated with increased\nseverity of denervation, so it is not surprising that the youngest\nnon-ambulatory SMA children appear more likely to demonstratea benefit with intervention [12]. Duration of treatment also\nappeared to be a factor and will need to be carefully considered in\nthe design of future clinical trials in non-ambulatory SMA subjects.\nThe ideal trial duration clearly depends on the expectedmechanism of the treatment to be studied and relies heavily on\nthe primary outcome measure chosen. This study affirms the value\nof the MHFMS in the multicenter pediatric clinical trial setting as\na simple, reliable and easy to use outcome measure for\ndocumenting gross motor function in children as young as two\nyears of age. However, if reinnervation is considered the most\nlikely mechanism for a given therapeutic intervention, a trial\nduration of at least one year or longer may be more ideal to prove\na treatment benefit using the MHFMS.\nPossible disease-related biomarkers assessed in this study\nincluded quantitative SMN mRNA and maximum ulnar CMAP.\nLevels of flSMN and D7 SMN mRNA did not change with VPA.\nIn contrast, VPA-response has been observed in SMA patient cell\nlines (16,17), one-third of SMA subjects (18) and in spinal cord of\ntype III-like SMA mice (24).

Because VPA targets are not specific, VPA\nresponse in SMA subjects may be much more complex than\nsimply altering SMN expression. Indeed, recent data in a mildSMA model suggests that VPA may function by increasing SMNmRNA and protein, decreasing apoptosis and enhancing neuro-\nprotection (24). Alternatively, whole blood may not be the\nappropriate cell type to detect changes in SMN expression, orsuch changes may be too small to be detected by relativequantification that relies on endogenous controls to normalize\ndata. Finally, the assay we used has limitations, because it is not\nbased on absolute quantification of SMN mRNA.\nThe strength of correlation between maximum CMAP\namplitude and our primary outcome measure, the MHFMS,\nsuggests that in non-ambulatory patients with SMA the CMAPmay be a robust surrogate outcome measure for assessingtreatment interventions if the putative mechanism of effect is toenhance innervated muscle mass by reinnervation or other trophic\neffects on nerve or muscle. However, baseline severity of\ndenervation overall in a given cohort will profoundly impactwhether or not improvement is anticipated and should be a keyconsideration in any trial design incorporating this as an outcome\nmeasure, as ceiling and floor effects may limit the usefulness of this\nassay in those of greater or lesser strength or age.\nIn summary, this study demonstrated no benefit from six months\nof treatment with VPA and L-carnitine in a young non-ambulatory\ncohort of subjects with SMA. Any modest biologic impact of VPAon individual outcome measures over the duration of treatment inthis study was clearly outweighed by weight gain. This trial\nconfirmed observations made in the open label study that the effects\nof age and weight gain with VPA are critical confounding factorsthat will have to be considered in the design of future clinical trials.Whether or not a subset of younger non-ambulatory SMA subjects\nmight benefit from VPA treatment early in the course of their\ndisease over a longer treatment period remains an outstandingquestion. Treatment intervention with VPA in non-ambulatorySMA children outside of a clinical study should be discouragedgiven the lack of clear benefit from this trial, and the potentially\nserious adverse events associated with VPA treatment. However,\nthese results should be interpreted in the context of the limitedtreatment duration examined, an issue which should be carefullyconsidered in the design of future clinical trials based on proposed\nmechanism of therapeutic action. We anxiously await the\ncompletion of ongoing studies of VPA in an ambulatory adultpopulation (the VALIANT trial, clinicaltrials.gov IDNCT00481013) to help us further expand our knowledge about\npossible biologic impact of VPA in subjects with SMA. The ability\nto obtain strength data from the entire cohort in the VALIANT trialshould help to answer outstanding questions about potentialbiologic effects of VPA in subjects with SMA, and whether this\nagent merits further study as a therapeutic agent in this disorder.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Baseline Body Mass by Treatment Arm.Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s001 (0.05 MB\nDOC)\nTable S2 Body Composition at Baseline by Treatment Arm.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s002 (0.04 MB\nDOC)\nTable S3 Pulmonary Function Testing at Baseline by Treatment\nArm.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s003 (0.06 MB\nDOC)\nTable S4 CMAP Values at Baseline by Treatment Arm.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s004 (0.04 MB\nDOC)\nTable S5 Myometry Scores at Baseline by Treatment Arm.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s005 (0.06 MB\nDOC)\nTable S6 PedsQL Parent Proxy Sub scores at Baseline by\nTreatment Group.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s006 (0.05 MB\nDOC)\nTable S7 PedsQL Child Assessment at Baseline by Treatment\nArm.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s007 (0.05 MB\nDOC)\nTable S8 Adverse events occuring during Phase I arm.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s008 (0.10 MB\nDOC)\nTable S9 Overall adverse events during all 12 months.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s009 (0.08 MB\nDOC)\nProtocol S1 Protocol Summary.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s010 (0.20 MB\nDOC)\nChecklist S1 CONSORT Statement 2001 Checklist.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012140.s011 (0.19 MB\nDOC)\nAcknowledgments\nCharles Scott, Ph.D with CBS Squared, Inc, Fort Washington,\nPennsylvania conducted the statistical analysis.
