Treatment records showed that 40 cases received magnesium sulfate treatment (single group), and 40 cases received enoxaparin sodium combined with magnesium sulfate treatment (combination group). Levels of D-dimer, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), \nplacental growth factor (PLGF), Apgar scores of newborns delivered before and after treatment were compared. \nGestation weeks and incidence of adverse reactions were analyzed.Results: After treatment, levels of D-dimer, sfit-1 and adverse reactions in the combination group were significantly \nlower than those in the single group (P<0.05), and the level of PLGF , newborn Apgar score and length of gestation were significantly higher than those in the single group ( P<0.05).\nConclusion:  Compared to magnesium sulfate alone, the combination of enoxaparin sodium and magnesium sulfate \nin the treatment of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia can more effectively regulate the cytokine level of patients, improve pregnancy outcome, and improve neonatal Apgar score. The incidence of adverse reactions is low, making it a safe and efficient treatment modality.\nKEY WORDS: Enoxaparin sodium, Magnesium sulphate, Neonatal Apgar score, Retrospective analysis, Severe \npreeclampsia.\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.40.5.9001\nHow to cite this: Lu D, Yu J, Sang L.

The \nmain objective of this study was to further clarify the \ntherapeutic effect of the combination of magnesium sulfate and enoxaparin sodium on patients with severe preeclampsia.\nMETHODS\n Clinical data of 80 patients with severe preeclampsia \ntreated in Hefei Second People\u2019s Hospital from January 2019 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. \nThe patients were divided into two groups according \nto the treatment scheme they received: single group (received magnesium sulfate alone, n=40) and the combination group (received magnesium sulfate \ncombined with enoxaparin sodium, n=40). \nEthical Approval: The ethics committee of our hospital was fully informed of the study and approved the study (Approval No.: 2018121801; Date: 12-December, 2018). All patients and their immediate family members \nvoluntarily participated in the study after knowing \nthe contents of the study in detail and signed relevant agreements.\nInclusion criteria: \n\u2022 Patients met the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)\u2019s diagnostic criteria of severe preeclampsia.\n8\n\u2022 Singleton live births.\n\u2022 Complete medical data. \nExclusion criteria:  \n\u2022 Patients with severe organic diseases, primary hypertension, diabetes, coagulopathy and \npsychiatric history. \n\u2022 Patients with language, cognitive, or mental \ndisorders.\n\u2022 Allergic to the drugs used in this study.\n\u2022 Those who were about to give birth or underwent surgery.\n\u2022 Premature rupture of membranes.\n\u2022 Severe myocardial damage.Therapeutic method: All patients received routine \ntreatment, including conventional antispasmodic, \nantihypertensive, and sedation. During the treatment, patients were closely monitored for changes in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as changes in fetal heart rate, and were guided to adopt a high-protein, low-fat diet. Patients in the single group were given magnesium \nsulfate injection (Yangzhou Zhongbao Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd; National approval number H32024805). Administration: First, 2.5g magnesium sulfate injection was diluted into 150ml mixture by adding 25% glucose \ninjection, and intravenous infusion was completed \nwithin 30min. Then 7.5g magnesium sulfate injection was mixed with 25% glucose injection to 600ml for intravenous infusion, and the administration rate was 1.5-2.0g /h. The maximum daily dosage of magnesium sulfate should be less than 25g, and  the treatment course was seven days. In the combination group, enoxaparin sodium \ninjection (Hangzhou Jiuyuan Genetic Engineering Co., Ltd; National approval number H20064067) was added on the basis of the treatment of a single group. Administration: Enoxaparin sodium injection was injected subcutaneously, 0.3 mL/time, once/day, and continued for seven days.Observation index: Levels of cytokines (D-dimer, \nplacental growth factor [PlGF], human soluble FMS like tyrosine kinase-1 [sfit-1]), Apgar score of newborns, gestational weeks and the incidence of adverse reactions (palpitation and sudden drop of blood pressure) were compared and analyzed before and after treatment.Statistical analysis: SPSS 20.0 was used for data \nanalysis. Normally distributed measurement data was reported as mean and standard deviation (SD), and compared using student t-test. Non-normally distributed data was reported as medians and interquartile intervals, and compared using Mann Whitney U test. Counting data were reported as n (%), and compared using Chi-squared test. P<0.05 was \nconsidered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\n A total of 80 patients were included in this study. \nThe single group included 16 primiparas and 24 multipara women, and the age of the patients ranged \nTable-I: Comparison of baseline characteristics between the two groups\nGroup n Age (year)primiparas/ multipara \n(n)pre-pregnancy BMI \n(kg/m\n2)\nSingle group 40 29.95\u00b12.92 16/24 24.84\u00b13.97\nCombination group 40 29.03\u00b12.87 15/25 24.82\u00b14.10\nt/ \u03c7\u00b2 continuity correction - 1.430 0.053 0.025\nP - 0.157 0.818 0.980\nPak J Med Sci     May - June  2024    Vol. 40   No. 5      www.pjms.org.pk     872from 22 to 36 years with a mean of 29.95\u00b12.92 years. \nThe combination group included 15 primiparas and 25 multipara women, and the age of the patients ranged from 24 to 35 years with a mean of 29.03\u00b12.87 years. There was no significant difference in the general characteristics (P >0.05) (Table-I).\n There was no significant difference in cytokine levels \nbetween the two groups before treatment (P >0.05. \nAfter treatment, D-dimer and sfit-1 in the combination group were significantly lower than those in the single group (P <0.05), and PLGF levels were significantly \nhigher than those in the single group (P <0.05) (Table-\nII). The Apgar scores of newborns delivered by the patients in the combined group at different times were significantly higher than those in the single group (P<0.05) (Table-III). Length of gestation (weeks) was \nsignificantly higher, and the incidence of adverse reactions was significantly lower in the combined group than in the single group (P <0.05) (Table-IV).\nDISCUSSION\n The results of this study show that compared \nto magnesium sulfate alone, the combination of enoxaparin sodium and magnesium sulfate in the treatment of severe preeclampsia can more effectively regulate patient\u2019s cytokine levels, improve neonatal Apgar scores, and have a lower incidence of adverse \nreactions. \n Wen J et al.\n9 showed that the efficacy of low molecular \nweight heparin sodium combined with magnesium \nsulfate in the treatment of severe preeclampsia patients is significantly higher than that of patients treated solely with magnesium sulfate.

It \ncan also improve placental microvascular flow and effectively prolong pregnancy, promote fetal growth, and improve clinical outcomes.\n10 The results of this \nstudy are consistent with the above research. The combination of enoxaparin sodium and magnesium \nsulfate in the treatment of severe preeclampsia can \ninhibit hypercoagulation, prevent spasms, lower blood pressure, and is the key to improving clinical symptoms in patients.\n9,10,11\n At present, patients with severe preeclampsia are \nmainly treated with antispasmodic and sedative drugs to slow down the progression of the condition and \nprolong the gestation.\n3,8 Magnesium sulfate, as the main \nantihypertensive drug for acute hypertension, is the first \nchoice for patients with severe preeclampsia, mainly \nbecause magnesium sulfate is able to reduce blood \npressure and relieve muscle convulsion by inhibiting the activity of the central nervous system, blocking conduction at the neuromuscular junctions, reducing \nor relieving muscle contractions, relaxing vascular \nsmooth muscles, and dilating the spasmodic peripheral blood vessels.\n5,12 However, the antihypertensive effect \nof the single use of this drug is relatively slow, and may lead to the withdrawal symptoms in patients. \nTherefore, the key to the effective treatment of severe \npreeclampsia with magnesium sulfate is to use drug combinations to improve treatment efficiency and drug safety.\n13,14\n Enoxaparin sodium, a low molecular fragment \nextracted from unfractionated heparin, is a vitamin K antagonist with high anticoagulant effect and has \nbeen commonly used in clinical practice. As a low \nmolecular weight heparin preparation, enoxaparin sodium has strong antithrombotic effect and certain thrombolytic effect.\n15 In combination with magnesium \nsulfate treatment in patients with severe preeclampsia, antithrombin III and its complex can enhance the \ninhibitory effect of antithrombin III on activated \ncoagulation factors II, IX, X, Xi and XII to prevent the transformation of fibrinogen into fibrin, prevent platelet aggregation, destroy and hinder thrombin \nactivity, thus preventing blood hypercoagulability.\n16,17 \nD-dimer is a specific degradation product formed after \nplasmin hydrolyzes cross-linked fibrin. It is one of \nthe molecular markers of hypercoagulable state and \nsecondary hyperfibrinolysis in vivo. As a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, it is a unique metabolite of secondary fibrinolysis and an important indicator of \nfibrinolytic function. Placental growth factor (PLGF) \nis a highly specific marker secreted by the placenta that regulates endothelial cell function and promotes neovascularization, and is considered an important indicator reflecting placental function. The decrease in \nPLGF level often indicates placental insufficiency, and patients are prone to complications such as miscarriage \nand preeclampsia. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) is an important index reflecting the growth of \nplacental blood vessels. The increase in its level can lead \nto endothelial dysfunction, and subsequently affect the shaping process of placental spiral arteries, resulting in abnormal placental perfusion.\n18 Both sFlt-1 and PLGF \nare considered early biomarkers of placental function, and the changes in their concentrations significantly \nprecede the onset of preeclampsia.\n19\n This study aimed to further clarify the clinical value \nof enoxaparin sodium combined with magnesium \nsulfate in the treatment of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia. Our results indicate that the \nincidence of elevated levels of D-dimer, sFlt-1 and \nadverse reactions in the combined group were significantly lower than those in the single group \ntreated with magnesium sulfate alone. Patients \nin the combined group had higher levels of PLGF. \nCombination of magnesium sulfate with enoxaparin \nsodium was associated with longer gestational \nperiod and higher Apgar scores (at different time \npoints) of newborns as compared to patients treated \nwith magnesium sulfate alone. Our results indicate \nthat enoxaparin sodium combined with magnesium \nsulfate is safe and effective in the treatment of severe \npreeclampsia, and can effectively adjust the levels \nof D-dimer, PLGF and sFlt-1, prolong the gestation \nperiod, prevent neonatal asphyxia, and improve \nphysical condition of newborns.\n9,10,18 We speculate \nthis effect of enoxaparin sodium may be due to its \nability to promote the release of endogenous heparin, maintain the dynamic balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis system, and strengthen the antithrombotic effect.\n20 Moreover, since enoxaparin \nsodium can decrease vasoconstriction, it may improve hypercoagulable state of pregnant women, as well as the hemodynamic performance, blood perfusion and placental circulation, and alleviate the oxygen supply pressure of placental syncytiotrophoblast cells, thus positively affecting physical condition of newborns.\n21 \n Our results suggest that enoxaparin sodium combined \nwith magnesium sulfate can produce a synergistic \neffect, which can effectively improve the fibrinolytic \nactivity, reduce the release of neurotransmitters, reduce blood flow resistance, improve local microcirculation, reduce organ ischemia and hypoxia, improve fetal blood supply and placental hemodynamics, and optimize maternal and infant outcomes.\n22\nLimitations: The current study is retrospective and \nhas a small sample size, which may be biased and its conclusions should be interpreted with caution. In \naddition, only a few indicators were studied, others \nsuch as 24-hour urinary protein and p-selectin levels were not studied. Furthermore, longer follow-up is needed to investigate the long-term health status and \npotential recurrence rate of patients.Dawei Lu et al.\nPak J Med Sci     May - June  2024    Vol. 40   No. 5      www.pjms.org.pk     874CONCLUSION\n Compared to magnesium sulfate alone, the \ncombination of enoxaparin sodium and magnesium \nsulfate in the treatment of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia can effectively adjust the cytokine level of patients, improve pregnancy outcome, and improve neonatal Apgar score, with a low incidence of adverse reactions. It is a safe and efficient treatment modality.\nREFERENCES\n1. Karrar SA, Hong PL. Preeclampsia. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2024 Jan.
