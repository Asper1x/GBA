The\nphysicochemical properties and flavor of the dry-cured meat were investigated. The presence of\nMg2+ions hindered the penetration of Na+into the meat. The weight loss, moisture content, and pH\nof all low-sodium salt groups were lower than those of S. Mg2+addition increased the water activity\n(Aw) of SPMA, SPM, and SM. Dry-curing meat with low-sodium salts promoted the production of\nvolatile flavor compounds, with Mg2+playing a more prominent role. Furthermore, low-sodium salts\nalso promoted protein degradation and increased the content of free amino acids in dry-cured meat,\nespecially in SM. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the low-sodium salts containing\nMg2+were conducive to improving the quality of dry-cured meat products. Therefore, low-sodium\nsalts enriched with Mg2+become a desirable low-sodium curing agent for achieving salt reduction in\ndry-cured meat products.\nKeywords: dry-cured meat; low-sodium salt; taste; aroma; magnesium ion; salt reduction\n1. Introduction\nDry-meat products crafted from whole pieces, such as dry-cured loin, ham, bacon,\nand jerked beef, are highly valued and enjoyed globally for their distinct sensory qualities\nand extended shelf life [ 1]. Generally, a significant amount of salt is added to dry-cured\nmeat products to reduce moisture and extend preservation time. For example, the salt\ncontent in dry-cured ham in Europe varies from 4.5% to 8% [ 2], while bacon ranges from\n1.65% to 3.7% in Australia [ 3]. However, in China, the amount of salt added to dry-cured\nmeat far exceeds that of other countries, especially in ham, where it can reach as high as\n7% to 12% [ 4]. Excessive consumption of sodium salts increases the risk of hypertension,\ncardiovascular disease, stroke, liver and kidney disease, gastric cancer, and osteoporosis,\netc. [ 5]. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the daily intake of salt for\nadults should be less than 5 g (2 g/sodium). Therefore, sodium reduction in meat products,\nespecially dry-cured meat products, has been garnering increasing attention.\nCurrently, various physical processing methods are used to reduce sodium addition\nin dry-cured meat products, such as high pressure, ultrasonic methods, and electric field\ntreatment [ 6]. There are also other methods, such as directly reducing the amount of\nNaCl [ 7], mediated pickling for salt reduction [ 8], and the utilization of low-sodium salts [ 9].\nAmong these methods, the partial replacement of NaCl with other metal salts is the most\nwidely used method in traditional dry-cured meat.\nPrevious studies have shown that reducing sodium content can affect the quality of\nmeat products, including sensory characteristics, flavors, bacterial colonies, and texture.\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29102194 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 2 of 22\nArmenteros et al. [ 10] and Wu et al. [ 11] demonstrated that using 50% KCl as a replacement\nfor NaCl in hams resulted in a more pronounced bitter taste. Wu et al. [ 12] found that\nreplacing over 40% of sodium with potassium significantly altered the distribution of\nvolatile compounds in dry-cured meat, leading to changes in aroma and flavor. Research\nby Lee et al. [ 13] indicated that in the dry-cured ham, replacing over 50% of NaCl with\nKCl led to a significant decrease in tenderness, while cooking loss increased with higher\nconcentrations of KCl. Nachtigall et al. [ 14] revealed that in the salted meat, under the same\nionic strength, calcium chloride (CaCl 2) exhibited higher oxidative capacity and had a more\npronounced impact on lipid profiles compared to NaCl and KCl. Li et al. [ 15] demonstrated\nthat in dry-cured bacon, 40% KCl effectively inhibited the formation of biogenic amines,\nbody alkalinity, and histamine while increasing the residual nitrate level. These findings\nindicated that different metal ions and substitution ratios have varying impacts on the\nquality of dry-cured meat products. Therefore, it is essential to explore suitable substitution\nlevels and formulas to avoid affecting the quality of dry-cured meat.\nTaking into consideration the high sodium level in dry-cured meat and the impacts\nlinked with salt reduction on the quality and sensory properties, this study used four\nformulations of low-sodium salt during the processing of dry-cured meat. By measuring\nthe physicochemical parameters, aroma, and taste of dry-cured meat products, we aim to\nselect composite salts to enhance the quality of dry-cured meat while achieving the highest\nreduction in sodium content. This research will provide a theoretical basis and technical\nsupport for the development of low-sodium dry-cured meat products.\n2. Results\n2.1. Effect of Low-Sodium Salts on the Physicochemical Properties of Dry-Cured Meat\n2.1.1. Metal Ion Content, Weight Loss, Moisture, Water Activity, and Water State of\nDry-Cured Meat\nTable 1 provides the measured content, theoretical content value, and permeability\nof each metal ion in dry-cured meat products. The contents of Na+, K+, and Mg2+in each\ngroup of samples were proportional to the formula content, which was consistent with\nexpectations. The amount of Na+added was relatively low in the groups SPMA, SPM, and\nSP compared to S, but they exhibited higher Na+permeability values. It was speculated\nthat the introduction of K+would sharply promote the penetration of Na+. However, the\nNa+permeability decreased in SM, which showed that adding Mg2+to the low-sodium\nsalt formulations with relative higher sodium contents may hinder the permeation of Na+.\nMg2+can strongly combine with the polar groups of proteins and strengthen the interaction\nbetween proteins [ 16], thereby hindering the penetration of Na+. Alino et al. [ 17] also found\ndivalent cations decreased salt penetration into dry-cured ham. In SPMA, SPM, and SP ,\nthe K+permeability reaches about 100 times the theoretical value. The reason may be that\nthe charge density of K+is lower than that of Na+and Mg2+, making it easy to diffuse\nin the meat to produce a concentration effect and concentrate at the sampling point. The\nMg2+permeability was only about 20% due to the large charge density of divalent ions [ 18].\nNo significant difference was observed in the Mg2+permeability of SPMA, SPM, and SM,\nindicating that Na+and K+had no effect on the penetration of Mg2+.\nAs shown in Table 1, the weight loss rate of each group basically remained between\n45.46% and 55.68%, though the weight loss rate of S (55.68%) was higher than that of\nother groups; in particular, it was significantly higher than that of SPM (47.42%) and SM\n(45.46%), indicating that low-sodium salt is beneficial to maintaining the moisture of dry-\ncured meat products. The lower weight loss of SM may be related to the permeation of\nions. As shown in Table 1, SM showed the lowest permeability of Na+and Mg2+. The\nmoisture content of dry-cured meat products gradually decreases as the fermentation time\nprogresses, eventually reaching a stable range, and Awwill also decrease as the moisture\ncontent decreases. Awaffects the nutrition value, color, flavor, and texture of food. In\naddition, Awhas an important role in food preservation. As shown in Table 1, the moisture\ncontent of each group decreased by about 65% and finally stabilized between 24% and 28%.\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 3 of 22\nAlthough there were no significant differences between the groups, it was noteworthy that\nthe SP had lower moisture content, which was also found in the samples salted with a\nmixture of NaCl and KCl [ 17]. As shown in Table 1, the Awof all groups was below 0.75,\namong which the Awvalues of SPMA (0.723) and SPM (0.729) were significantly higher\nthan SP (0.704). In Table 1, it also can be seen that the moisture contents of SPMA, SPM,\nand SM were higher than that of SP . The higher moisture content was in parallel with a\nhigher Awvalue [ 17]. Ultimately, the moisture content and Awof the Mg2+-containing\ngroups (SPMA, SPM, and SM) were higher; Alino, Grau, Toldra and Barat [ 17] also found\nthe same results.\nTable 1.

The relaxation time T2represents the strength of water mobility; that is, a\nshorter relaxation time represents lower mobility. As shown in Figure 1a, it can be seen\nthat all groups contain three to four relaxation peaks, which has also been reported in the\nsurimi-starch system [ 19]. The first two peaks were located between 0\u20131 ms and 1\u201310 ms,\nwhich belong to strongly bound water ( T2b1) and weakly bound water ( T2b2), respectively.\nThe relaxation time between 30\u2013100 ms ( T21) was immobilized water that interacts with the\ncharged groups located between the fiber bundles. The relaxation time greater than 100 ms\n(T22) was related to the free water existing outside the myofibril. As shown in Figure 1a,\nT2b2was a major peak in dry-cured meat. The relaxation time of each group was between\n3\u20137 ms. It can be seen from Figure 1b that S had the highest proportion of bound water,\nreaching 94.69%, while the immobilized water and free water were only 2.56% and 0.94%,\nrespectively.

For\na*, the order of samples was SPMA > S > SP > SM > SPM.

According\nto reports in the literature, the TBARS value increases with increasing ionic strength [ 25];\ntherefore, pork treated with higher ionic strength mixtures (SPMA and SM) had higher\nTBARS values, which corresponded to the ionic strength values of each. In a study re-\ngarding Brazilian low-sodium dry-fermented sausages containing blends of NaC1, KCl,\nand CaC1 2, Dos Santos et al.

Effect of Low-Sodium Salts on the Aroma of Dry-Cured Meat\n2.2.1. Volatile Compound Profile\nThe types of volatile organic compounds in raw pork are relatively few, but multiple\ntypes of volatile compounds are formed after dry-curing, resulting in a richer flavor.\nHowever, the number of volatile compounds in dry-cured meat was still much less than\nthat in dry-cured ham [ 27]. Compared with dry-cured ham, dry-cured meat had a shorter\nmanufacturing time (around three months versus 12 months). According to Supplementary\nTable S1, a total of 55 different volatile compounds from nine different chemical groups were\nidentified in the finished dry-cured meat by HS-GC-MS, including 12 aldehydes, 1 2 esters,\n8 alcohols, 8 ketones, 5 alkanes, 2 pyrazines, 4 aromatics, 3 olefins, and 1 furan compoun ds.\nAs shown in Figure 3, aldehydes were the most abundant volatile compounds. Alde-\nhyde compounds in each group accounted for 42.49%\u201364.42% of the total volatiles, among\nwhich SP accounted for the highest proportion of 64.42%. The closest proportion to S\n(46.13%) was SM (42.49%). The order of aldehyde proportion content was SP > SPM >\nSPMA > S > SM, and there was no significant difference between each group. In addition,\nSM\u2019s proportions of total volatiles of esters, ketones, aromatics, and furans was also closest\nto that of S. The proportion of alcohols in each group was in the order of SPM > SM > SP >\nS > SPMA. The proportion of alcohols in SPM was significantly higher than that in S and\nSPMA. The proportion of esters in each group was SPMA > SM > S > SPM > SP , and the\nproportion of esters in SPMA was significantly higher than that in SP . The proportions of\nketones and alkanes in each group were SPMA > SPM > SP > SM > S, and SPMA, SPM, and\nSP were significantly higher than S. The proportion of pyrazines in each group was SP > S\n> SPM > SM. SP was significantly higher than SM, and SPMA did not contain pyrazines.\nThe proportion of aromatics in each group was S > SM > SP > SPM > SPMA, and S was\nsignificantly higher than SPMA. The proportion of furans in each group was SM > SPMA\n> SP > S > SPM, and there was no significant difference between the groups. In terms of\ncompound types, S, SPMA, SPM, SP , and SM had 34, 39, 41, 38, and 41 volatile compounds,\nrespectively. The findings showed that the addition of low-sodium salt increased the species\nof volatile compounds in dry-cured meat. Importantly, the SPMA, SPM, and SM groups\ncontaining Mg2+had more volatile compounds than SP , which contains KCl.\nMolecules 2024 , 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 23 \n \n  \nFigure 3.

It can be seen from  Supplementary Table S1 that the total content of aldehydes \nin all groups showed the following pa ttern: SP > SM > SPM > SPMA > S, among which the \naldehydes content in SP was signi \ufb01cantly higher than that of SPMA and S. Among the 12 \naldehydes, the OAV values of 3-Methylbuta nal, 2-Methylbutyral, Pentanal, Hexanal, \nHeptaldehyde, Octyl al dehyde, 1-Nonanal, ( E)-2-Heptanal, ( E)-2-Octenal, Decyl \naldehyde, and ( E)-2-Nonenal were greater than 1 (Table 2). It is generally accepted that \ncompounds with OAV > 1 play an important role in overall odor [29]. 3-Methylbutanal \nand 2-Methylbutyral originate from the degradation of amino acids [29], and these \ncompounds contribute positively to the se nsory quality of dry-cured meat products, \ncontributing to the overall aroma by providing cheesy, nu tty, and salty notes [26]. The \norder of their content was SM > SPM > SP > S > SPMA and SM > SP > SPM > S > SPMA, \nrespectively. SM was signi \ufb01cantly higher than SPMA, be cause SM had a higher NaCl \nconcentration and thereby promoted the format ion of 3-Methylbutanal [30]. It is worth \nnoting that Octyl aldehyde, Hexanal, Pe ntanal, and 1-Nonanal (linear aldehyde) \nrespectively represent rancid smell, nu tty aroma, grassy smell, and strong grease smell. \nThe content of these compounds was relatively  high, and the OAV values were all greater \nthan 1, indicating that fat oxidation was acti ve during the dry-curing process of the meat. \nThe content order of each group of these compounds was SP > SM > SPM > SPMA > S, \namong which SP was signi \ufb01cantly higher than S. These compounds usually originate from \nfat autooxidation reactions [31,32], and adding low-sodium salt will increase the content \nof the aforementioned linear al dehydes because low-sodium salt promotes fat oxidation. \nIt was speculated that the pro-oxidative activity of lower concentrations of NaCl may be \nfurther enhanced due to the presence of K+ [11]. ( E)-2-Heptanal and ( E)-2-Nonenal had a \ngreen, fa tty, and rancid taste, but there were no signi \ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between the groups. \nDecyl aldehyde has a spicy waxy odor and is formed by \u03b2-oxidation of unsaturated fa tty \nacids [33]. The Decyl aldehyde content in SP was signi \ufb01cantly higher than that in SPMA \nand S, which may be explained by the fact that the presence of KCl enhances the \u03b2-\noxidation reaction [33]. ( E)-2-Octenal exhibited a sweet aroma or the smell of cucumber or \nmelon. The ( E)-2-Octenal in SP and SPM was signi \ufb01cantly higher than that in SPMA, SM, \nFigure 3.

It can be seen from Supplementary Table S1 that the total content of aldehy-\ndes in all groups showed the following pattern: SP > SM > SPM > SPMA > S, among\nwhich the aldehydes content in SP was significantly higher than that of SPMA and S.\nAmong the 12 aldehydes, the OAV values of 3-Methylbutanal, 2-Methylbutyral, Pentanal,\nHexanal, Heptaldehyde, Octyl aldehyde, 1-Nonanal, ( E)-2-Heptanal, ( E)-2-Octenal, Decyl\naldehyde, and ( E)-2-Nonenal were greater than 1 (Table 2). It is generally accepted that\ncompounds with OAV > 1 play an important role in overall odor [ 29]. 3-Methylbutanal and\n2-Methylbutyral originate from the degradation of amino acids [ 29], and these compounds\ncontribute positively to the sensory quality of dry-cured meat products, contributing to the\noverall aroma by providing cheesy, nutty, and salty notes [ 26]. The order of their content\nwas SM > SPM > SP > S > SPMA and SM > SP > SPM > S > SPMA, respectively. SM was\nsignificantly higher than SPMA, because SM had a higher NaCl concentration and thereby\npromoted the formation of 3-Methylbutanal [ 30]. It is worth noting that Octyl aldehyde,\nHexanal, Pentanal, and 1-Nonanal (linear aldehyde) respectively represent rancid smell,\nnutty aroma, grassy smell, and strong grease smell. The content of these compounds was\nrelatively high, and the OAV values were all greater than 1, indicating that fat oxidation was\nactive during the dry-curing process of the meat. The content order of each group of these\ncompounds was SP > SM > SPM > SPMA > S, among which SP was significantly higher\nthan S. These compounds usually originate from fat autooxidation reactions [ 31,32], and\nadding low-sodium salt will increase the content of the aforementioned linear aldehydes\nbecause low-sodium salt promotes fat oxidation. It was speculated that the pro-oxidative\nactivity of lower concentrations of NaCl may be further enhanced due to the presence of\nK+[11]. (E)-2-Heptanal and ( E)-2-Nonenal had a green, fatty, and rancid taste, but there\nwere no significant differences between the groups. Decyl aldehyde has a spicy waxy odor\nand is formed by \u03b2-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids [ 33]. The Decyl aldehyde content\nin SP was significantly higher than that in SPMA and S, which may be explained by the fact\nthat the presence of KCl enhances the \u03b2-oxidation reaction [ 33]. (E)-2-Octenal exhibited\na sweet aroma or the smell of cucumber or melon. The ( E)-2-Octenal in SP and SPM was\nsignificantly higher than that in SPMA, SM, and S, because SM contains more diketone\ncompounds and amino acids (Table 3 and Table S1), while the formation of ( E)-2-Octenal\nrequires free amino acids and diketone compounds.\nAlcohols often have aromatic, vegetal, and earthy notes and are an integral part of\ndry-cured cuts of meat. A total of 8 alcohols were detected in the meat, and the order of the\ntotal content of each group was as follows: SM > SP > SPM > SPMA > S, among which SM,\nSP , and SPM were significantly greater than SPMA and S, indicating that the low-sodium\ngroup without Arg addition significantly increased the alcohol content of dry-cured meat,\nbecause NaCl itself has antibacterial activity, whereas partial substitution will result in\nstronger microbial growth and higher branched-chain alcohol production [ 34]. Among\nthe eight alcohols, the OAVs of 3-Methyl-1-butanol, 1-Pentanol, 1-Hexanol, 1-Octen-3-ol,\n1-Heptanol, and 1-Octanol were all greater than 1. No significant difference was observed\nin each group for alcohols containing 3-Methyl-1-butanol, 1-Pentanol, 1-Hexanol, and\n1-Octen-3-ol. 1-Heptanol has a strong aromatic odor, and the order of content in each group\nwas SM > SP > SPM > S > SPMA, with SM being significantly higher than the other groups.\n1-Octanol has a pungent odor, which may come from the oxidation of myristic acid, linoleic\nacid, palmitoleic acid, or oleic acid. The order of the content of each group was SP > SM >\nSPM > SPMA, among which SP was significantly higher than SPMA. There was no Octanol\nin S, probably because the high content of NaCl inhibited the growth of microorganisms\nand reduced the production of branched-chain alcohols.\nEster compounds are derived from the esterification reaction of carboxylic acids and\nalcohols. Esters containing short-chain acids have a fruity flavor, but long-chain acids\nproduce fatty flavors [ 28]. The order of the total content of esters in each group was SM\n> SPMA > S > SPM > SP . SM was significantly higher than SP , indicating that partial\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 8 of 22\nreplacement of magnesium increases the content of esters in dry-cured meat. Among\nthem, the OAVs of Methyl butyrate, Methyl 2-methylbutyrate, Methyl Isovalerate, Methyl\npentanoate, Methyl caproate, Ethyl caproate, \u03b3-Caprolactone and \u03b3-octa lactone were\nhigher than 1, and there was no significant difference between the groups in the contents of\nMethyl Isovalerate, \u03b3-Caprolactone, and \u03b3-octa lactone. The most abundant ester in each\ngroup was methyl hexanoate, which has a pleasant smell and comes from the esterification\nreaction of ethanol and acid. The order of methyl hexanoate content in each group was SM\n> SPMA > S > SPM > SP , among which SM was significantly higher. Methyl butyrate has an\napple aroma, and the content order of each group was SM > SPMA > SPM > S > SP . Methyl\n2-methylbutyrate ester has a pungent, ethereal fruity smell, and the content order of each\ngroup was SM > S > SPM > SPMA > SP . Ethyl caproate has a fruity aroma like pineapple,\nand the content order of each group was as follows: SM > SPM > SPMA > S. The levels of\nMethyl butyrate, Methyl 2-methylbutyrate, and Ethyl caproate in SM were significantly\nhigher than in the other groups.\nTable 2.

The order of the\ntotal content of ketones in each group was as follows: SM > SP > SPMA > SPM > S. The\ntotal content of ketones in S was significantly lower than that of other groups, indicating\nthat the addition of low-sodium salt increased the amount of ketones in dry-cured meat.\nAmong them, the OAVs of 2-Heptanone and 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one were greater than\n1, and 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one has been considered a safe compound [ 35], but there was\nno significant difference between the contents of each group. 2-Heptanone is an oxidation\nproduct of fatty acids [ 30]. It has a fruity aroma similar to pear and has been detected in\nmany dry-cured meat products, such as ham and sausages [ 30]. The order of the content of\neach group of 2-Heptanone was SM > SP > SPMA > SPM > S, where SM was significantly\nhigher than SPM and S, among which the origin of linear 2-ketones was related to the\n\u03b2-oxidation activity of mold growing on the surface of dry-cured meat products [ 36]. The\nreason may be that the high ionic strength of SM enhances fat oxidation of dry-cured\nmeat [26].\nAs for alkane compounds, there were very few types and contents in dry-cured meat.\nIn addition, the threshold value was high, so their contribution to the aroma of the meat was\nvery small. As shown in Table 2, among the alkane compounds, there was no OAV value\ngreater than 1. Our study found that 2,3,5-Trimethylpyrazine and Tetramethylpyrazine had\nOAVs greater than 1. The order of the total content of pyrazine substances in each group\nwas SP > S > SPM > SM, but SPMA does not contain pyrazines. 2,3,5-Trimethylpyrazine\nand Tetramethylpyrazine have the smell of corn, nuts, hazelnuts, baking, spices, and\nchocolate [ 37], and are usually formed by the condensation of two \u03b1-aminocarbonyl groups\nthrough the Strecker reaction. The order of content in each group was SP > S > SM >\nSPM and SP > S > SPM, respectively, among which SP was significantly higher than the\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 10 of 22\nother groups. It can be formed from free amino acids and reducing sugars [ 38]. Four\naromatic compounds were also discovered in SM. The total amount in S was the highest,\nbut there was no significant difference between the groups. In addition, three olefin\ncompounds were found, namely 1-Octene, trans-2-Octene, and Dipentene, but there was\nno significant difference between the groups. Finally, a furan compound was discovered.\nFuran compounds provide a lot of aromas to meat products. 2-Pentylfuran is a linoleic\nacid oxidation product with the sensory properties of beans and green grass and a low\nthreshold [ 39]. SM had the highest 2-Pentylfuran content, but there was no significant\ndifference between the groups.\n2.2.2. Aroma in Dry-Cured Meat Determined by Electronic Nose\nThe electronic nose radar chart intuitively shows the response intensity to various\nsubstances. Figure 4 shows the results of the response intensity of volatile substances\nproduced by dry-cured meat under 18 types of sensors. The response substances cor-\nresponding to the 18 types of sensors are S1 (Alkanes, smoke), S2 (alcohols, aldehydes,\nshort-chain alkanes), S3 (ozone), S4 (sulfides), S5 (organic amines), S6 (organic gases, ben-\nzophenones, aldols), S7 (short-chain alkanes, such as methane, natural gas, and biogas), S8\n(short-chain alkanes, such as propane and liquefied gas), S9 (aromatic compounds, aldols),\nS10 (hydrogen-containing gas), S11 (alkanes, alkenes), S12 (short-chain alkanes, such as\nliquefied gas and methane), S13 (combustible gases, such as methane), S14 (combustible\ngases and smoke), S15 (alkanes, organic gases), S16 (sulfides), S17 (nitrides), S18 (ketones,\nalcohols). As illustrated in Figure 4, the response values of S1, S4, S5, S6, S7, S10, S11,\nS12, S16, S17, and S18 sensors in SM were all the highest, indicating that SM contained\nmore volatile compounds, which was consistent with the results of GC-MS (Supplementary\nTable S1).\nMolecules 2024 , 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 23 \n \n  \nFigure 4.

Peptides with a molecular weight greater than 10,000 Da include \nsome macromolecular peptides or preliminar ily hydrolyzed proteins [40]. The peptide \nmolecular weight (>10,000 Da) in each group followed the order S > SPMA > SM > SPM > \nSP; in particular, S was signi \ufb01cantly higher than SPM, SP, an d SM, indicating that partial \nsubstitution of sodium facilitates protein degradation.

Peptides with a molecular weight greater than 10, 000 D a\ninclude some macromolecular peptides or preliminarily hydrolyzed proteins [ 40]. The\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 11 of 22\npeptide molecular weight (>10,000 Da) in each group followed the order S > SPMA > SM\n> SPM > SP; in particular, S was significantly higher than SPM, SP , and SM, indicating\nthat partial substitution of sodium facilitates protein degradation. The peptides with a\nmolecular weight distribution between 180 and 500 Da may be related to polypeptides that\nproduce flavor, salty taste, and other tastes. The order of those in each group was SP > S PM\n> SPMA > SM > S, among which SP and SPM were significantly higher than other groups.\nFor molecular weights less than 180 Da, related to the content of free amino acids, the\ncontents of SP , SM, and SPMA were greater than those of S and SPM, which implies that\nmore free amino acids formed in SP , SM, and SPMA.\nMolecules 2024 , 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 23 \n \n  \nFigure 5.

Free Amino Acid Contents in Dry-Cured Meat \nThe release of free amino acids (FAAs) results from protein degradation. As shown \nin Table 3, the promoting e \ufb00ect on total free amino acids (TFAAs)accumulation of KCl and \nMgCl 2 partially replacing NaCl was consistent wi th the results of Armenteros et al. [41] \nand Jos\u00e9 M et al. [42]. The TFAAs content of SM was the highest at 2391.7 mg/100g, which \nwas signi \ufb01cantly higher than that of S and SPM, wh ich is related to their pH. Aksu et al. \n[43] reported that low pH could increase protein degradation. Table 1 also show that SM \nwith higher TFAAs had lower pH than S and SPM. \nThe umami amino acids in SM were signi \ufb01cantly higher than those in the other \ngroups, indicating that partial replacement of NaCl with MgCl 2 can promote protein \ndegradation to produce more Glu and Asp. In addition, K \u0119ska et al. [44] found that Glu \ncan impart salty and umami \ufb02avors to dry-cured meat and inhibit bi tterness. The sweet \namino acid content of SP was signi \ufb01cantly higher than that of the other four groups, which \nindicates that only KCl can produce the formation of more sweet-related amino acids \nwhen it partially replaces NaCl. For bi tter amino acids, the total content order was SM > \nSPM > SPMA > SP > S. It can be seen that the low-sodium salt groups have more bi tter \namino acids, but they are all within the a ppropriate range. In the present study, the \ufb01nal \nfree amino acid content was lower than that reported by the authors of [45] in dry-cured hams, which may be due to shorter processing times. \n2.3.3. Taste Analysis by Electronic Tongue \nIn addition to a \ufb00ecting the aroma, low-sodium salt also a \ufb00ects the taste. Therefore, \nan electronic tongue was used to measure the saltiness, bi tterness, sourness, and richness \nof dry-cured meat. In terms of richness, the response values order was SM > SPMA > S > SP > SPM (Figure 6). It is worth noting that comparing SPMA and SPM revealed a small \ndi\ufb00erence in Arg, but their richness was signi \ufb01cantly di \ufb00erent, indicating that adding a \nsmall amount of Arg could increase the richne ss of dry-cured meat. The response values \nof umami taste in each group were in the following order: SPM > S > SP > SM > SPMA. \nConversely, the umami taste intensity of SPMA was signi \ufb01cantly lower than that of SPM. \nThese results show that adding Arg cannot improve the umami taste of dry-cured meat, \nbut has an inhibitory e \ufb00ect.  \nFigure 5.

Free Amino Acid Contents in Dry-Cured Meat\nThe release of free amino acids (FAAs) results from protein degradation. As shown in\nTable 3, the promoting effect on total free amino acids (TFAAs)accumulation of KCl and\nMgCl 2partially replacing NaCl was consistent with the results of Armenteros et al. [ 41] and\nJos\u00e9M et al. [ 42]. The TFAAs content of SM was the highest at 2391.7 mg/100g, which was\nsignificantly higher than that of S and SPM, which is related to their pH. Aksu et al. [ 43]\nreported that low pH could increase protein degradation. Table 1 also show that SM with\nhigher TFAAs had lower pH than S and SPM.\nThe umami amino acids in SM were significantly higher than those in the other groups,\nindicating that partial replacement of NaCl with MgCl 2can promote protein degradation\nto produce more Glu and Asp. In addition, K\u02db eska et al. [ 44] found that Glu can impart salty\nand umami flavors to dry-cured meat and inhibit bitterness. The sweet amino acid content\nof SP was significantly higher than that of the other four groups, which indicates that only\nKCl can produce the formation of more sweet-related amino acids when it partially replaces\nNaCl. For bitter amino acids, the total content order was SM > SPM > SPMA > SP > S. It\ncan be seen that the low-sodium salt groups have more bitter amino acids, but they are all\nwithin the appropriate range. In the present study, the final free amino acid content was\nlower than that reported by the authors of [ 45] in dry-cured hams, which may be due to\nshorter processing times.\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 12 of 22\n2.3.3. Taste Analysis by Electronic Tongue\nIn addition to affecting the aroma, low-sodium salt also affects the taste. Therefore,\nan electronic tongue was used to measure the saltiness, bitterness, sourness, and richness\nof dry-cured meat. In terms of richness, the response values order was SM > SPMA > S >\nSP > SPM (Figure 6). It is worth noting that comparing SPMA and SPM revealed a small\ndifference in Arg, but their richness was significantly different, indicating that adding a\nsmall amount of Arg could increase the richness of dry-cured meat. The response values\nof umami taste in each group were in the following order: SPM > S > SP > SM > SPMA.\nConversely, the umami taste intensity of SPMA was significantly lower than that of SPM.\nThese results show that adding Arg cannot improve the umami taste of dry-cured meat,\nbut has an inhibitory effect.\nMolecules 2024 , 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 23 \n \n  \nFigure 6.

This \nshowed that the salty a ttributes were not only produced by Na+ but can also be produced \nby other metal ions as well as peptides and free amino acids. As shown in Figure 5, the \namount of peptides of molecular weig ht 180\u2013500 Da in SM and SP was signi \ufb01cantly higher \nthan that in other groups, indicating that Mg2+ or K+ alone can promote the production of \nsalty peptides. As for bi tterness, the response values were SM > SPMA > SP > S > SPM, \namong which SM and SPMA were signi \ufb01cantly higher than SP, S, and SPM. Zhang et al. \n[46] also found that the presence of KCl and MgCl 2 enhanced the bi tter taste. However, \nthe bitterness values of each group in this study were less than the lowest response value \nof 4.91, which was acceptable to the senses. In terms of sourness, although there were \ndi\ufb00erences in the response values between sa mples, the values were all less than the \nminimum response threshold of \u221213, which can be considered to be extremely weak \nsourness. \n2.4. E\ufb00ect of Low-Sodium Salts on Sensory Scores of Dry-Cured Meat \nThe dry-cured meat was evaluated in four areas: appearance, taste, texture, and \noverall acceptance, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. As shown in Table 4, SM received the \nhighest scores in gloss, saltiness, umami, and fat adhesion. Its bi tterness was the lowest \namong the low-sodium salt group. Its overal l acceptance was also the highest among the \nlow-sodium salt group, indicating that the sensory evaluators were more satis \ufb01ed with \nSM. In terms of color, the colors of the low-sodium salt groups (SPMA, SPM, SP, and SM) \nwere all redder than S, with SP having the highest redness, which was consistent with the \ncolor results shown in Table 1. The bi tterness scores of the low-sodium salt group were \nhigher than those of S, which was consistent with the content of bi tter amino acids shown \nin Table 3. According to reports, substitution of 50% KCl increases the bi tterness of dry-\ncured meat [10], but addition levels of 28% and 12% (KCl and MgCl 2) did not result in \nreports of bi tterness from the assessors in our study.  In terms of umami taste, SM scored \nthe highest, which was consistent with the umami amino acid content shown in Table 3. \nAs shown in Figure 2, SM had a higher TBAR S value. It was speculated that SM had the \nhighest degree of fat oxidation, resulting in higher adhesion. The overall acceptance scores \nof SM and SPMA were the highest among the low-sodium salt groups. \nFigure 6.

This\nshowed that the salty attributes were not only produced by Na+but can also be produced\nby other metal ions as well as peptides and free amino acids. As shown in Figure 5, the\namount of peptides of molecular weight 180\u2013500 Da in SM and SP was significantly higher\nthan that in other groups, indicating that Mg2+or K+alone can promote the production of\nsalty peptides. As for bitterness, the response values were SM > SPMA > SP > S > SPM,\namong which SM and SPMA were significantly higher than SP , S, and SPM. Zhang et al. [ 46]\nalso found that the presence of KCl and MgCl 2enhanced the bitter taste. However, the\nbitterness values of each group in this study were less than the lowest response value of 4.91,\nwhich was acceptable to the senses. In terms of sourness, although there were differences in\nthe response values between samples, the values were all less than the minimum response\nthreshold of \u221213, which can be considered to be extremely weak sourness.\n2.4. Effect of Low-Sodium Salts on Sensory Scores of Dry-Cured Meat\nThe dry-cured meat was evaluated in four areas: appearance, taste, texture, and\noverall acceptance, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. As shown in Table 4, SM received the\nhighest scores in gloss, saltiness, umami, and fat adhesion. Its bitterness was the lowest\namong the low-sodium salt group. Its overall acceptance was also the highest among the\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 13 of 22\nlow-sodium salt group, indicating that the sensory evaluators were more satisfied with\nSM. In terms of color, the colors of the low-sodium salt groups (SPMA, SPM, SP , and SM)\nwere all redder than S, with SP having the highest redness, which was consistent with the\ncolor results shown in Table 1. The bitterness scores of the low-sodium salt group were\nhigher than those of S, which was consistent with the content of bitter amino acids shown in\nTable 3. According to reports, substitution of 50% KCl increases the bitterness of dry-cured\nmeat [ 10], but addition levels of 28% and 12% (KCl and MgCl 2) did not result in reports of\nbitterness from the assessors in our study. In terms of umami taste, SM scored the highest,\nwhich was consistent with the umami amino acid content shown in Table 3. As shown in\nFigure 2, SM had a higher TBARS value. It was speculated that SM had the highest degree\nof fat oxidation, resulting in higher adhesion. The overall acceptance scores of SM and\nSPMA were the highest among the low-sodium salt groups.\nTable 4.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of Physicochemical Properties, Aroma, Taste, and\nSensory Scores\nPCA can reduce the dimensionality of complex data and further reflect the overall\ninformation provided by the sample. In Figure 7, PC1 and PC2 cover 41.8% and 19.5%,\nrespectively, with a cumulative value of 61.3%. The five treatment groups in this study were\nclearly separated in terms of PC1. Furthermore, SP differed from other components by PC2\nthrough indicators such as sweet amino acids, aldehydes, pyrazines, shear force, and K+\ncontent. Most physicochemical properties were grouped in the negative quadrant of PC1,\nwhereas most sensory attributes, electronic nose odor, and free amino acid content were\ngrouped in the positive quadrant of PC1. The components detected by GC-MS, especially\naldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and pyrazine, have a strong correlation with the odor detected\nby electronic nose. S was described as related to shear force, aromatic compound content,\nNa+content, and b*. However, excessive shear force and pH are detrimental to meat\nproducts. SM was described as related to electronic tongue aftertaste, free amino acids, total\namino acids, and electronic tongue bitterness. SM and S were the farthest apart, indicating\na significant difference between them, which was conducive to the enhancement of the\nquality of dried-cured meat in terms of shear force, water loss, and pH. In addition, SPMA\nwas considered to be related to Aw, ester content, TBARS, Mg2+content, sensory properties,\nand bitter amino acids. Also, SP was described as related to electronic nose S9, sensory\nhardness, sweet amino acid content, aldehyde content, and K+content.\nImportantly, SPMA, SPM, and SM containing Mg2+had more volatile compounds\nthan SP in terms of flavor (Figure 3). Sensory evaluation also found that SM had a higher\noverall acceptance compared to other groups. Therefore, magnesium ions contribute to\nimproving the quality of dry-cured meat products.\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 14 of 22\nMolecules 2024 , 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 23 \n \n  \nFigure 7.

The chopped sample (0.5 g) \nwas added into 10 mL of HNO 3 for digestion using a microwave digestion system (EHD-\n24, Donghang Scien-Tech, Beijing, China).

The standard curves were established based on standard substances \nfor sodium, potassium, and magnesium ions. The standard curve equations for calculating \nthe content of sodium, potassium, and magnesium were y = 0.3728 x + 0.0298, R2 = 0.9972; \ny = 02277 x + 0.016, R2 = 0.9944; y = 0.6554 x + 0.4554, R2 = 0.9916, respectively. The sodium, \npotassium, and magnesium contents remainin g in the meat and the permeability were \ncalculated by the following equations: \n\ud835\udc4b=\u0bbc\u00d7\u0bcf\u00d7\u0bd9\n\u0b35\u0b34\u0b34\u00d7\u0be0\u00d7 (\u0b35\u0b3f\u0bea )  \n\ud835\udc43=\u0bc5\u0b3f\u0bd1\n\u0bd1\u00d7 100%   \nwhere X is the salt content (g/100 g dry weight); C is the sodium content obtained from \nstandard curves (mg/mL); V is the solution volume (mL); f is the dilution rate; m is the \nFigure 8. The appearance of meat ( A) during curing, both in the ( B) early and ( C) later stage of\nnatural fermentation.\n3.3. Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium Content\nThe metal ion content in the various treated meats was determined according to\nnational standards [ 48,49] with minor modification, using atomic absorption spectroscopy\n(Mars 6, American CEM Service Corp, Charlotte, NC, USA). The chopped sample (0.5 g)\nwas added into 10 mL of HNO 3for digestion using a microwave digestion system (EHD-\n24, Donghang Scien-Tech, Beijing, China). After cooling down, the mixture was placed\non an electric heating oven to drive HNO 3to near dryness, and adjusted to a constant\nvolume of 50 mL with deionized water, immediately followed by the determination of\nsodium, potassium, and magnesium contents by atomic absorption spectrometry. The\npermeability was calculated based on the difference between the actual ion content and the\ntheoretical value. The standard curves were established based on standard substances for\nsodium, potassium, and magnesium ions. The standard curve equations for calculating\nthe content of sodium, potassium, and magnesium were y= 0.3728 x+ 0.0298, R2= 0.9972;\ny= 02277 x+ 0.01 6,R2= 0.9944; y= 0.6554 x+ 0.4554, R2= 0.9916, respectively. The sodium,\npotassium, and magnesium contents remaining in the meat and the permeability were\ncalculated by the following equations:\nX=C\u00d7V\u00d7f\n100\u00d7m\u00d7(1\u2212w)\nP=L\u2212X\nX\u00d7100%\nwhere Xis the salt content (g/100 g dry weight); Cis the sodium content obtained from\nstandard curves (mg/mL); Vis the solution volume (mL); fis the dilution rate; mis the\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 16 of 22\nsample weight (g); and wis the moisture content. Pis permeability (%); Lis theoretical\naddition amount, that is, the amount of added metal ions.\n3.4. Weight Loss\nAt the end of fermentation, the meat was weighed and its weight recorded. The weight\nloss was calculated using the following equation:\nWeight loss (%) = ( 1\u2212Weight o f meat at the end o f f ermentation (g)\nFresh meat weight (g))\u00d7100%\n3.5. Moisture Content and Water Activity (A w)\nThe moisture content of dry-cured meat was assessed by the weight difference of meat\nbefore and after drying at 105\u25e6C.\nTo determine the water activity ( Aw), the chopped sample (2.0 g) was tiled in a water\nactivity measuring dish so that the sample completely covered the bottom of the cassette.\nThen, the cassette was placed in a pre-heated water activity meter (HD-3A-4, Nanjing,\nChina) for 20 min for water activity determination.\n3.6. Low-Field1H NMR Measurements\nA low-field nuclear magnetic resonance analyzer (LF-NMR) with a proton resonance\nfrequency of 49.74 MHz and a permanent magnet strength of 20 \u00b10.08 T was used to\nanalyze the water state in dry-cured meat according to the method reported by Wang\net al. [ 50] with some modifications. A quantity of meat with the same weight (4.0 g) was\nplaced in a 30 mm diameter NMR tube, and signals were acquired using a CPMG pulse\nsequence. The main parameters were set as follows: TW (wait time) of 3000 ms, TE (echo\ntime) of 1.0 ms, NECH (number of echoes) of 1000, and NS (number of scans) of 4. Mu ltiEx\nInv analysis software (NIUMAG nuclear magnetic resonance analysis application software\nVer4.0) was used to fit the CPMG decay curve with a multi-exponential fitting and the\nSRIT algorithm was used to obtain the transverse relaxation time ( T2) curve and the\ncorresponding NMR parameters.\n3.7. pH\nThe meat (10 g) was put into a 150 mL centrifuge tube, containing 100 mL of 0.75% KCl\nsolution. The mixture was homogenized for 1 min using a homogenizer (FS-2, Guoyu Instru-\nments, Changzhou, China) and filtered with a gauze. The pH of the filtrate was measured\nimmediately using a pH meter (PHS-3C, Yidian Scientific Instruments Co, Shang hai, C hina).\n3.8. Shear Force\nThe method was slightly modified from that described by Alino, Grau, Toldra and\nBarat [ 17]. The meat was cut into a 200 mm \u00d7200 mm \u00d7200 mm cube and sheared on\na texture analyzer (TA.XT. Plus, Stable Micro Systems, Godalming, UK) equipped with a\nload cell of 50 kg. The testing conditions were as follows: the pre-test probe speed was\n2 mm /s, the test speed was 1 mm/s, and the post-test speed was 2 mm/s. The trigger force\nand compression distance were set as 5 g and 28 mm, respectively. The probe type used\nwas HDP/BSK.\n3.9. Surface Color\nThe color of the dry-cured meat was measured using a colorimeter (CR-400, Konica\nMinolta, Tokyo, Japan) with a D65 light source. The colorimeter was calibrated with a\nstandard whiteboard (ch00) and blackboard before measurement. The probe with a lighting\nsection diameter of \u03a68mm lightly touched the meat pieces, which were sliced to a thickness\nof about 3\u20135 mm. The observation angle was approximately 2\u25e6. The color was expressed in\nterms of luminosity ( L*), redness ( a*), and yellowness ( b*) values. Each measurement was\nperformed in triplicate.\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 17 of 22\n3.10. Thiobarbituric Acid (TBA) Values\nProportional amounts of lean and fat meat samples (2 g) were weighed and mixed\nwith 17 mL 2.5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 3 mL 1% thiobarbituric acid (TBA). After\nheating in a boiling water bath for 30 min, the mixture was removed and cooled to room\ntemperature. Four milliliters of the supernatant were mixed with an equal volume of\nchloroform, shaken to mix thoroughly, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at room\ntemperature. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm after calibration\nwith chloroform.\n3.11. Volatile Compound Measurement\nThe extraction of volatile compounds was carried out using the headspace solid-phase\nmicroextraction (HS-SPME) technique [ 51]. A chopped sample of 3.00 g was added into\na 20 mL headspace vial. 1,2-dichlorobenzene (100 mg/L) of 4 \u00b5L was added as an in-\nternal standard, and the vial was sealed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) silicone\nseptum. The vial was then equilibrated for 10 min in a water bath at 45\u25e6C. A divinylben-\nzene/carboxy/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber was selected, exposed in\nthe headspace of the vial, and extracted for 30 min at 45\u25e6C. Finally, gas chromatography-\nmass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for qualitative and quantitative analysis. A DB-wax\n(0.25 mm \u00d70.25\u00b5m\u00d730 m) capillary column was used. The inlet temperature was 250\u25e6C,\nand the SPME fiber was desorbed into the GC inlet for 5 min. The split ratio was set as 1:5.\nThe temperature program of the oven was as follows: initial temperature of 40\u25e6C, held for\n2 min, increased to 90\u25e6C at a rate of 3\u25e6C /min, held for 5 min, then increased to 2 00\u25e6Cat\na rate of 3\u25e6C /min and to 230\u25e6C at a rate of 15\u25e6C /min, held for 10 min. Helium was used\nas the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The interface temperature was 280\u25e6C, and\nthe ion source temperature was 230\u25e6C. Electron energy was 70 eV . The scan mode was used\nwith a mass scan range of 45~450 m/z. Compounds were identified by searching the NIST\n21 mass spectral library and retention indices (RI), with a sim ilarity > 90% . The relative\ncontent of each compound was calculated by comparing its area to that of the internal\nstandard. Three parallels were set for each treatment, and the results were calculated on a\ndry basis and further analyzed by taking the average value. The OVA value was calculated\naccording to the following equation:\nOAV =C\nT\nCis compound content ( \u00b5g/kg); Tis the threshold value for the compound.\n3.12. Electronic Tongue Detection\nPeptide molecular weight was determined according to the method of Wang et al. [ 52].\nThe sample (25 g) was mixed with 100 mL of ultrapure water and homogenized using\na homogenizer (T25, IKA, Staufen, Germany). The suspension was filtered using a filter\npaper, and then the collected filtrate was centrifuged at 4\u25e6C and 8000 r/min for 10 min.\nThe supernatant was filtered again using filter paper. The richness, saltiness, sourness,\numami, bitterness, astringency, aftertaste-B, and aftertaste-A of the sample were analyzed\nusing an electronic tongue (SA402B, INSENT, Kanagawa, Japan).\n3.13. Peptide Molecular Weight Distribution Determination\nPeptide molecular weight was determined according to the method of Zhan et al. [ 53],\nwhich was modified by Wang et al. [ 52]. An accurately weighed 3 g of chopped sample\nwas mixed with 30 mL of ultrapure water, and homogenized at 10,000 r/min for 30 s\nin an ice bath. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 r/min and 4\u25e6C for\n10 mi n. Ultimately, the supernatant was filtrated with a double-layer filter paper, and then\na 0.22 \u00b5m PES filter membrane before measurement.\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 18 of 22\n3.14. Free Amino Acid Measurement\nA high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used to detect the\ncontent of free amino acids in the dry-cured meat [ 52]. Firstly, 1 g of meat sample was\naccurately weighed and mixed with 25 mL of 5% TCA, followed by 30 min of ultrasonic\ntreatment. After standing for 2 h, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7gfor 1 0 mi n.\nFinally, the supernatant obtained after centrifugation was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m PES\nfilter membrane. The chromatographic conditions were as follows: an ODS Hypersil\ncolumn (250 mm \u00d74.6 mm \u00d75\u00b5m) was used, and the column temperature was kept at\n40\u25e6C. The mobile phases A and B were 0.6 mmol/L sodium acetate and 0.15 mmol/L\nsodium acetate-acetonitrile-methanol (1/2/2, v/v/v), respectively. The flow rate was set to\n1.0 mL/min.\n3.15. Electronic Nose Detection\nThe response of volatile compounds was measured using an electronic nose (C-Nose,\nBaosheng Industrial Development Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) consisting of 18 metal oxide\ngas sensors (S1\u2013S18). The minced meat sample (4 g) was placed in a 20 mL headspace\nvial, and equilibrated at 50\u25e6C for 50 min. The cleaned sensor array was set to zero with\nprocessed clean air as the carrier gas. Then, 200 \u00b5L of the sample was injected with a wash\ntime of 100 s and a test time of 60 s, and the device was cleaned for 5000 s before each\nmeasurement. Three measurements were conducted for each sample.\n3.16. Sensory Analysis\nSelection of sensory assessors: fifty volunteers aged 20\u201325 years old were recruited\nfrom Kunming University of Science and Technology. According to National standard [ 54],\na questionnaire survey was designed to understand the interests and motivations of sensory\nassessors, whether they dislike dry-cured meat products, whether they have taken drugs\nthat impair sensory function or worn dentures, and whether there is sufficient time. Subse-\nquently, the volunteers were trained in terms of identification and intensity discrimination\nfor taste, aroma, texture, and color attributes. The training program was conducted over\n4 stages in one month. Ultimately, 18 assessors (9 males and 9 females) were selected by\nidentification and intensity tests of taste, aroma, texture, and color attributes.\nAccording to the method described by Sugimoto et al. [ 55], the quality of dry-cured\nmeat was evaluated in 5 attributes including appearance, taste, texture, and overall accep-\ntance. Each sensory assessor evaluated the sample on a scale of 1 to 5. The quality of the\nmeat was judged on a scale of 1 to 5. Table 5 shows the sensory evaluation criteria.\nTable 5. Sensory attributes and assessment criteria for sensory evaluation.\nCategory Sensory AttributesJudgment Criteria\n(a Scale of 1 to 5)\nAppearanceRedness Pale pink to dark red\nHomogeneity Non-homogeneous to homogeneous\nGlossiness Glossy from dark to bright\nTasteSaltiness Not distinctly salty to moderately salty\nBitterness Not bitter to distinctly bitter\nUmami Not perceived to perceived\nSweetness Not very sweet to very sweet\nTextureMeat hardness Loose to very hard in texture\nFat adhesiveness Not adhesive to appropriately adhesive\nChewiness Poorly chewable to very chewable\nOverall acceptance Overall acceptance Unattractive to very attractive\nBefore analysis, the sample was sliced with a thickness of 2 mm, and then cooked\nat 90\u25e6C in a water bath. The entire slice, including lean and fat areas, was placed on a\nMolecules 2024 ,29, 2194 19 of 22\nplastic board encoded with a 3-digit number and presented to the assessors. The order\nof sample presentation systematically varies between evaluators to balance the impact of\nservice order and carryover. During the evaluation period, the assessors were provided\nwith salt-free biscuits and water for cleaning the oral cavity. All tests were conducted in a\nstandard sensory laboratory. The sensory testing was evaluated by the ethical committee of\nKunming University of Science and Technology.\n3.17. Statistical Analysis\nUnless otherwise stated, three parallel experiments were set up in each group. Experi-\nmental data were processed by one-way ANOVA in Minitab 21, and results were expressed\nas mean \u00b1standard deviation (SD). Multiple comparisons were made by the Tukey test,\nwith p< 0.05 indicating a significant level of difference.\nTo assess the contribution of the major physicochemical parameters, volatile com-\npounds, electronic nose data, molecular weight distribution, free amino acids, electronic\ntongue data, and sensory scores in all samples, the data were evaluated by multivariate\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) using the origin 2022.\n4. Conclusions\nLow-sodium salt-cured meat products have good development prospects and are\nsuitable for the needs of people with low sodium intake. In this study, four groups\nof low-sodium salts (SPMA, SPM, SP , and SM) and one group of pure NaCl (S) were\nused to process meat, and their physical and chemical properties, aroma, and taste were\nanalyzed. It was found that Mg2+can strongly combine with the polar groups of proteins to\nstrengthen the interaction between proteins, thus hindering the penetration of salt. The Na+\npermeability of the SM was only 77.85%, which was much lower than other groups, and the\nsalt reduction reached 24.19%. Regarding flavor, partial replacement of metal ions, except\nfor SP , promoted the oxidation of meat and increased the types of volatile compounds. In\naddition, the low-sodium salt groups had lower pH values. A low pH value will increase\nthe degradation of protein, causing more proteins in the low-sodium salt groups to degrade\ninto small molecule peptides and amino acids, making dry-cured meat products richer in\ntaste. The study provides a clearer direction for further exploration of marinade recipes\nand provides a theoretical basis for low-sodium dry-cured ham.\nSupplementary Materials: The fo llowing supporting information can be downloaded at: https://\nwww.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules29102194/s1, Table S1: Content of volatile compounds in\ndry-cured meat with the addition of different low-sodium salts.\nAuthor Contributions: J.X.: Methodology, Investigation, Data curation, Writing\u2014original draft.
