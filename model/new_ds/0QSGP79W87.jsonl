Ginger has numerous chemical compounds,\nsuch as phenolic constituents, volatile compounds (VOCs), and\npolysaccharides [ 2]. Among them, VOCs are considered one of the\neffective compounds in ginger due to their functional properties,\nincluding anti-in \ufb02ammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic [ 3]. Ginger\nhas four different degrees of processed products, including fresh\nginger (SJ), dried ginger (GJ), baked ginger (PJ), and ginger charcoal\n(JT), and they have different types and contents of VOCs [ 4].\nHowever, the processing process of ginger is dif \ufb01cult to control as\nthe identi \ufb01cation of different degrees of processed ginger mainly\ndepends on the subjective evaluation of the pharmacists, such as\nappearance color, shape, and texture [ 4]. Compared with subjective\nevaluation, instrument analysis is more objective and accurate.\nIn this study, headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility\nspectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and machine learning are employed to\nanalyze VOCs and discriminate different degrees of processedginger. We commenced by collecting different batches of SJ and\nmaking different degrees of processed ginger according to China\npharmacopoeia 2020 Edition. The authenticity of these samples\nwas evaluated by traditional Chinese medicine experts. The VOCsfrom different degrees of processed ginger were analyzed by HS-\nGC-IMS. The analytical conditions are recorded in Table S1 . A total\nof eighty VOCs were identi \ufb01ed in the different degrees of processed\nginger ( Table S2 ). The abbreviation of VOCs is shown in Table S3 .\nThe 3D chromatograms and the top view of GC-IMS 3D chro-\nmatograms of VOCs in different degrees of processed ginger are\nshown in Figs. S1A and B , respectively.\nThe heatmap of different degrees of processed ginger was formed\nbased on the peak signal in the top view of 3D chromatograms. As\nshown in Fig. 1 , some aldehydes and esters were mainly divided in\nthe blue box, and the higher content of these compounds indicated\nthat they are primarily present in SJ. Some alcohols and acids were\nmainly divided in the purple box, and the higher content of these\ncompounds indicated that they are primarily present in GJ. The\nabove results may be caused by the oxidation of chemical com-\npounds at high temperatures, wherein more aldehyde compounds\nare oxidized into acid compounds. Some alcohols, ketones and het-\nerocyclic compounds were mainly divided in the green box, and the\nhigher content of these compounds suggested that they are pri-\nmarily present in PJ. The above results can be attributed to theMaillard reaction due to the ketones are the products of the frag-\nmentation of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in the second stage of the\nMaillard reaction [ 5]. Some esters and ketones were mainly divided\nin the pink box, and the higher content of these compounds sug-\ngested that they are primarily present in JT. In a word, the oxidation\nand Maillard reaction may occur in the stir-frying process of ginger.\nAdditionally, the principal component analysis (PCA) is per-\nformed in this work to further understand the differences in the\nVOCs of different degrees of processed ginger ( Fig. S1C ). The result\nof the classi \ufb01cation distance suggested that PJ and JT were close to\neach other, which could be attributed to the bias between subjec-\ntive judgment results and actual results (subjectively mistaking PJ\nfor JT). Moreover, the classi \ufb01cation distance between SJ and other\ngroups was the furthest, which might be related to the types and\ncontent of VOCs.\nSubsequently, machine learning algorithms were used to screen\nindicator compounds and to quickly discriminate different gingerPeer review under responsibility of Xi \u2019an Jiaotong University.\n*Corresponding author.

The VIP\n>1, |coef| >0.1239, and coef >0.0734 were set as screening condi-\ntions of these algorithms, respectively ( Figs. S2A eC). As shown in\nFig. S2D , a total of nine indicator compounds were screened, and\ntheir content in different degrees of processed ginger was different,\nwhich suggested that these indicator compounds could be used for\ntraining machine learning models ( Figs. S2E and S3 ).\nSecondly, as shown in Table S4 , based on the screened indicator\ncompounds, ten machine learning algorithms were used to predict\ndifferent degrees of processed ginger. Machine learning algorithms\ncan predict four possible results: true positive (TP), true negative\n(TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN). Predicted results\nincluding precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy are calculated to\nevaluate model performance based on the number of predicted\noutcomes in each of the four categories, as de \ufb01ned by the following\nformulas:\nPrecision \u00bcTP\nTP\u00feFP\nRecall \u00bcTP\nTP\u00feFN\nF1 score \u00bc2TP\n2TP\u00feFP\u00feFN\nAccuracy \u00bcTP\u00feTN\nTP\u00feTN\u00feFP\u00feFN\nBefore analysis, the data are divided into training set and testing\nset by random sampling process in a ratio of 8:2 ( Table S5 ). Then,\nfour performance metrics, namely precision, recall, F1 score, andaccuracy, were assessed ( Table S6 ). The accuracy of all machine\nlearning algorithms was over 0.91, indicating that they all had good\nclassi \ufb01cation ability. Additionally, most machine learning models\nhad good performance in classifying SJ and GJ. The top three ma-\nchine learning algorithms (support vector machine with the linear\nkernel (SVM-L), logistic regression (LR) and quadratic discriminant\nanalysis (QDA)) achieved high prediction accuracy due to their\nmathematical properties. Meanwhile, SVM-L tended to have a\nsimpler decision boundary, which could make it easier to interpretand implement in practical applications. LR was a linear model that\nprovides coef \ufb01cients associated with each feature, allowing for easy\ninterpretation. QDA required relatively few computational re-\nsources for training and prediction. Therefore, the in \ufb02uence of\nfactors such as model complexity, interpretability and required\ncomputational resources were considered, these models were well-\nsuited for developing a prediction model to classify the different\ndegrees of processed ginger. As shown in Fig. S4 , the confusion\nmatrix was displayed. The results of these machine learning algo-\nrithms showed satisfactory classi \ufb01cation results, whereas some\nmisclassi \ufb01cations occurred between PJ and JT in the confusion\nmatrix. The results of these machine learning models were\nacceptable and they could be applied in the prediction of different\ndegrees of processed ginger.\nFinally, the testing set was used to verify the predicted ability of\nthese models. The confusion matrix of the predicted results for\nthese models in the testing set is shown in Fig. S5 . Similarly, some\nmisclassi \ufb01cations also occurred between PJ and JT in the confusion\nmatrix, which could be attributed to misclassi \ufb01cation of the model\nfor PJ and JT in the training set, leading to misclassi \ufb01cation of the\nmodel for PJ and JT in the testing set. More data might be needed to\nassist the model in predicting these two classes and optimize the\nmodel. Furthermore, another reason was that PJ and JT were very\nsimilar in some features, which were not obvious and were dif \ufb01cult\nto distinguish. This behavior could be explained by the results of\nPCA. The accuracy of models in testing set is listed in Table 1 . The\nSVM-L, LR, and QDA also showed high accuracy. These behaviors\nindicated that these machine learning models had high stability,\nreliability, and reproducibility, making them suitable for different\ndegrees of processed ginger.\nIn summary, this study identi \ufb01ed different degrees of pro-\ncessed ginger based on HS-GC-IMS and machine learning. A total\nof eighty VOCs were identi \ufb01ed using HS-GC-IMS. Among them,\nnine VOCs, such as hydroxyacetone and 2-hexanol, were regarded\nas indicator compounds. Additionally, based on the nine indicator\ncompounds, ten machine learning models for identi \ufb01cation of\nprocessed degrees showed good prediction ability. Among them,\nSVM-L, LR and QDA models can accurately identify different de-\ngrees of processed ginger, with accuracies of 0.9412, 0.9706, and\n0.9412 in testing set, respectively. Meanwhile, these models\nshowed many advantages, such as easy interpretation, low model\ncomplexity and few computational resources. Overall, three\nFig. 1.
