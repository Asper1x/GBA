It significantly impairs overall function and \nquality of life. Consumption of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty \nacids (PUFAs) and regular aerobic exercise (AEx) training are reported \nto have positive effects on the progression of RA. However, the \nmechanisms behind these benefits are still inconclusive. This study \nprotocol will investigate the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation and \nAEx training on disease progression, cardiometabolic health, and \nquality of life, and their association with the plasma and synovial fluid \nlevels of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in subjects with \nRA. \nMethods:  The study consists of a 16-week intervention period, during Open Peer Review\nApproval Status  \n \n \n1 2 3\nversion 1\n07 Aug 2023\nview\n view\n view\n\u0141ukasz Poniatowski , Central Clinical Hospital \nof the Ministry of the Interior and \nAdministration, Warsaw, Poland1. \nPhilip C Calder\n , University of \nSouthampton, Southampton, UK2. \n\u00a0\nPage 1 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:942 Last updated: 08 JUN 2024\nCorresponding author:  Sebasti\u00e1n Jannas-Vela ( sebastian.jannas@uoh.cl )\nAuthor roles:  Jannas-Vela S : Conceptualization, Funding Acquisition, Methodology, Project Administration, Resources, Supervision, \nValidation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing; Candia AA : Investigation, Methodology, Project \nAdministration, Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing; Pe\u00f1ailillo L : Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, \nWriting \u2013 Review & Editing; Barrios-Troncoso P : Visualization, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing; Zapata-Urz\u00faa J : Visualization, Writing \u2013 Review \n& Editing; Rey-Puente J : Visualization, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing; Aukema HM : Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing \u2013 Review \n& Editing; Mutch DM : Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing; Valenzuela R : Investigation, Methodology, \nResources, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing; Valladares-Ide D : Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing \u2013 Original \nDraft Preparation, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing\nCompeting interests:  No competing interests were disclosed.\nGrant information:  This work is supported by FONDECYT (Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient\u00edfico y Tecnol\u00f3gico) Grant Number \n(#11220333) by ANID of Chile.

They lead to significant improvements in functionality (decreased stiffness) and quality of life;\nhowever, they result in increased healthcare costs. Importantly, these treatments have no effect or even augment the\ncardiometabolic risk factors associated with this disease, probably due to the sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary patternsof RA individuals.\n5\u20137Furthermore, as these traditional treatments target and inhibit the signaling pathways that produce\ninflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis alpha (TNF- \u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), they lead to immunosup-\npression and other unwanted side effects.10Interestingly, there is substantial evidence supporting that consumption\nor supplementation with omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and regular aerobic exercise (AEx)training have positive effects on RA. For instance, several studies report significant benefits of n-3 PUFA on clinical\nand functional outcomes in RA individuals, usually when high doses were used (> 2g/d).\n11\u201313In particular, regular\nconsumption of fish oil rich in n-3 PUFAs leads to the incorporation of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3, EPA) anddocosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3, DHA) into blood and synovial fluid phospholipids.\n14This has been shown to improve\nseveral disease-specific and functional outcomes of RA, such as morning stiffness,15joint pain,16number of swollen and\ntender joints,17grip strength,18,19decreased NSAID consumption,15,20and health-related quality of life.13In addition,\nregular consumption of n-3 PUFAs decreases the serum levels of the proinflammatory mediator thromboxane B 2(TXB 2)\nand the production of prostaglandin E 2(PGE 2) after 24 h incubation of blood with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).20Moreover,\nn-3 PUFA supplementation reduces the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including the blood levels ofC-reactive protein (CRP),\n21TNF- \u03b122and IL-1 \u03b2.18Surprisingly, the specific mechanisms behind the anti-inflammatory\nand positive health-related effects of n-3 PUFAs in RA individuals are still inconclusive.\nThe regular practice of physical activity/exercise is also an effective and multifactorial approach for improving several\naspects of health in RA subjects, including cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and functional health.23For\ninstance, RA participants who performed 6 months of regular AEx [3 times per week at 70% of peak oxygen consumption\n(VO 2peak)] improved their cardiorespiratory fitness (8% VO 2peak) and cardiometabolic health.24Furthermore, AEx\ntraining improved symptoms and specific clinical measures of RA, including the perception of fatigue, joint pain,physical function (decreased walk time and increased grip strength), quality of life [health assessment questionnaireHAQ)], and RA disease activity score (23%).\n6,23\u201326These beneficial effects are most likely mediated by the anti-\ninflammatory effects of exercise; however, the mechanisms behind this effect are not yet known.\nBecause some of the putative mechanisms behind the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation and AEx training\noverlap,27\u201329the combination of these treatments in individuals with RA may further improve their health. However,\nto date, no study has examined the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation and AEx training in individuals with\nRA. Further, the emergence of a novel class of lipid metabolites derived from n-3 PUFAs \u2013specialized pro-resolving\nmediators (SPMs) \u2013which activate pathways that reduce excessive inflammation, yet also enhance pathways necessary\nfor tissue repair and regeneration,30,31has initiated a promising new era of research that could explain the benefits\nobserved after n-3 PUFA supplementation and AEx in individuals with RA. However, whether they are responsible for\nthis adaptive response, also remains to be elucidated.\nResearch hypothesis: N-3 PUFA and AEx will have synergistic effects on disease progression, cardiometabolic health,\nand quality of life in individuals with RA, and these changes will be associated with SPM production in blood and\nsynovial fluid.\nGeneral aim: To investigate the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation and AEx training on disease progression,\ncardiometabolic health, and quality of life and their association with the plasma and synovial fluid levels of SPMs in\nindividuals with RA.\nPage 3 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:942 Last updated: 08 JUN 2024\nSpecific aims :\n(1) To compare the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation, AEx training, and the combination of both on disease\nprogression, cardiometabolic health, and quality of life in individuals with RA.\n(2) To compare the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation, AEx, and the combination of both on the plasma and\nsynovial fluid levels of the SPMs in individuals with RA.\n(3) To examine the relationship between the plasma levels of the n-3 PUFA derived SPMs with systemic disease\nprogression, cardiometabolic health, and quality of life in individuals with RA\nTo achieve these aims we have designed a randomized, 16-week, placebo-controlled, blinded interventional trial.\nProtocol\nStudy settingsParticipants will be recruited from hospitals and private clinics in the central region of Chile, whereas all the interventions\nregarding AEx will be carried out at the Universidad de O \u2019Higgins and the Hospital Regional de Rancagua. All\ninstitutions are in the Regi \u00f3n del Libertador Bernardo O \u2019Higgins, Chile.\nSample size\nThe sample size calculation for this study is based on an \u03b1level of 0.05, a power (1- \u03b2) of 0.8, and effect size of 0.42\n(morning stiffness).\n11A minimum of 18 participants are necessary per group; however, 22 individuals will be recruited to\naccount for a typical dropout rate of 20% in long-term intervention studies.\nParticipants\n88 individuals (18-65 y) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will be recruited via newspaper advertisements, posters, flyers,\nvisits to local community centers, and referrals from associated centers and Rheumatologists. All participants will obtainmedical clearance from their Rheumatologist before taking part in the study. Individuals with moderate disease activity,as defined by the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) > 2.6 and < 5.1 will be included. Participants taking nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) will be\neligible; however, the dosages of these agents must be constant at least four weeks before, must remain within this limitthroughout the study, and prednisone dose should not be higher than 7.5 mg/d.\n32Individuals diagnosed with gastroin-\ntestinal or metabolic diseases, regular alcohol abuse, smokers, and dietary supplement intake (e.g., fish oil capsules)\nor consumption of fish > 2 times per week will be excluded. Further, individuals that perform regular aerobic exercise(> 150 min moderate intensity per week) or have any physical or biomechanical limitations to complete the exercise\nprogram will also be excluded. Finally, subjects will be excluded if they present blood levels of aspartate aminotrans-\nferase, alanine transaminase, or creatinine higher than 1.5 times the maximum normal limit and total bilirubin levels ofmore than 1.8 mg/dL.\n33,34Participants will be encouraged to continue with their everyday normal activities. They will be\nfully informed of the nature and possible risks of the experimental procedures before providing their written informed\nconsent. Participation in this study is voluntary.\nStudy design\nThis study consists of a 16-week intervention with n-3 PUFAs and/or aerobic exercise (AEx) training. The subjects\nwill be randomly assigned in a double-blinded manner to one of four groups: placebo control (PLA), PLA+AEx, n-3, or\nn-3+AEx. A stratified randomized assignment (by block) process will be employed to ensure that the experimental groupsare balanced for disease activity, pharmacological treatment, sex, and age. The principal investigator and pharmacy\npersonal will be aware of patient allocation and will code the information. Patients and exercise intervention supervisors\nwill be blinded for supplement intervention, while medical specialists and database analysis personal will be blinded forsupplement treatment and exercise intervention. The study will be unblinded for patients and medical specialist if theparticipant worsens their condition according to the criteria described below or if they decide to drop out the study.\nThe training sessions will be conducted at the Laboratorio de Ciencias del Ejercicio en el Ciclo Vital (Lab-CERVITAL),\nUniversidad de O \u2019Higgins. The week before intervention the participants will perform RA specific tests (e.g., Disease\nActivity Score-28) and functional measurements (e.g., handgrip strength), peak aerobic capacity test, a dietary and\nphysical activity assessment, and blood samples will be collected. Subsequently, participants will start their 16-week\nintervention (PLA, PLA+AEx, n-3, or n-3+AEx). At the end of the intervention the same initial measurements,questionnaires, and assessments will be collected. In a subgroup of participants (n=24 in total or n=6 per group)extraction of synovial fluid will be performed before and after the intervention.\nPage 4 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:942 Last updated: 08 JUN 2024\nPrimary and secondary outcomes\nPrimary outcome: Early morning stiffness is one of the main outcomes significantly improved by n-3 PUFA supple-\nmentation in RA patients.11Therefore, the difference in the duration (minutes) of early morning stiffness has been\nselected as the primary outcome to compare the intervention effect in each group after the intervention period.\nSecondary outcomes: Other relevant outcomes which allow the assessment of disease progression will be measured, such\nas the Disease Activity Score-28, DHA-SPMs, tender and swollen joint count, quality of life, grip strength, analgesic use,\nand TNF- \u03b1blood levels.\nSupplementation and exercise intervention\nThe participants will be supplemented with either 5 capsules per day of Omega UP (Newscience, Chile) equivalent to2.5 g/d of DHA and 0.5 g/d of EPA or a placebo filled gelatin capsule. The current doses are within the limits\nrecommended by the European Food Safety Authority and have been shown to be safe, to be incorporated into cell\nmembranes, and to produce significant improvements in overall health in individuals with RA.\n35\u201338Capsules will be\nplaced into de-identified bottles by people not involved in the study and provided to the participants to ensure double\nblinding.\nPatients will be given 2-4 weeks of capsules at a time, with all capsules counted before and after this timeframe, and a\nsmall notepad will be provided for them to write down every time when the capsules are taken. Furthermore, patients willreceive weekly phone calls and text messages to serve as reminders for treatment adherence. Capsule treatment will be\ndiscontinued if patients worsen their condition or if the patient decides to drop-out without questioning their decision.\nThe exercise intervention will be performed according to the recommendations from the European Alliance of\nAssociations for Rheumatology (EULAR) consisting of aerobic type exercise training three times per week, on non-\nconsecutive days, with a total time of 20-60 minutes.\n25The AEx will be performed on a stationary electronically braked\ncycle ergometer starting at 40-50% of VO 2peak for 20 minutes. The intensity and volume of cycling will then be gradually\nincreased to target at least 60-70% of VO 2peak for 50-60 minutes over the final 10 weeks. Heart rate, power output and\nrating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be monitored during training intervention.\nA brief talk about the exercise importance for their conditions will be made every first session of the week to create\nawareness about it. Also, sessions have been planned at moderate intensity to decrease the risk of discomfort and toimprove adherence. The exercise intervention will be stopped if the patient presents any discomfort related to fatigue,\nconsciousness, cardiac, respiratory, or muscular hassle. Furthermore, if at some point disease symptoms are an obstacle\nfor exercise practice, the patient will be advised to drop out the study. Finally, all patients in the exercise group may dropout from the study at any point without justification.\nIn case of any question or inquiry during the follow-up, the patients will be given a phone number and email to contact\nstudy the personnel. Furthermore, during the phone calls made by the personnel a question regarding compliance with the\nstudy will be asked. If these measures are not enough for promoting participant retention and the patient decides to dropout, a question regarding their reason for discontinuation will be asked. This information will be analyzed to avoid future\nstudy dropouts.\nMonitoring\nA data monitoring committee will not be needed in this study since it has minimal risks and will be a short period ofintervention. Interim analyses will be made by the principal investigator and a selected team of personnel every two\nweeks, indicating the total number of reported adverse events and its severity, any other undesirable effect, and the\nnumber of dropouts.\nCharacterization and anthropometric measures of participants\nBody mass and height will be determined with a scale and wall-mounted stadiometer. The participant \u2019s age, body mass\nindex (BMI), educational status, socioeconomic level, years of diagnosis, smoking habits, comorbidities, and medica-\ntions will be recorded.\nRA disease progression\nDuration of morning stiffness : This will be assessed by asking \u201cHow long is your morning stiffness from waking until\nmaximum improvement? \u201d.\n39The duration of morning stiffness will be reported in minutes up to a maximum of\n180 minutes.\nPage 5 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:942 Last updated: 08 JUN 2024\nDisease Activity Score-28 (DAS28 ): Describes the severity of rheumatoid arthritis using clinical and laboratory data. It is\ncomposed of the number of swollen joints (total 28), the number of tender joints (total 28), the Westgren erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate (ESR), and patients \u2019global disease assessment through a visual analog scale (VAS). The DAS28 has\nbeen extensively validated for its use in clinical trials and it is required by the Chilean Ministry of Health.40\nHealth assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQDI): This tool evaluates the functional status of RA individuals.\nIt consists of eight sections: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities, with 2 or 3 questions for\neach section. Scoring is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The 8 scores of the 8 sections are summed and\ndivided by 8. This questionnaire has been validated to be used among Chilean RA patients.41\nQuality of life RA (QOL-RA) scale : This scale is an RA-specific health-related quality of life instrument consisting of an\n8-item scale. Each item starts with the definition of an element to be considered in rating one \u2019s quality of life, followed by\na horizontal 10-point scale anchored with 1 (very poor) at one end and 10 (excellent) at the other end. The elements are\nphysical ability, pain, interaction with family and friends, support from family and friends, mood, tension, arthritis, andhealth. The higher the QOL-RA Scale score, the higher the health-related quality of life. This scale has been validated to\nbe used in the Spanish language.\n42\nAnalgesic use : Analgesic use will be measured using pill counts for paracetamol and NSAIDs.\nFunctional measurements\nTimed Up and Go test : The participant starts in a seated position, stands up upon command, walks 3 meters, turns around,\nwalks back to the chair, and sits down. The time stops when the subject is seated.\nShort Physical Performance Battery (SPPB ): This battery of tests evaluates lower extremity functional performance\nusing timed measures of standing balance, a 4-meter walk, and five repetitive chair stands.43\nHandgrip strength : Measures the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. The participant holds the\ndynamometer in the hand with the arm at a right angle and the elbow by the side of the body. When ready, the participant\nsqueezes the dynamometer with maximum isometric effort for 3-5 seconds. Participants will be instructed to perform thetest as fast and hard as possible and verbal encouragement will be provided simultaneously. The highest value out of threecontractions will be used for analysis.\nPeak aerobic capacity\nThe VO\n2peak will be determined during an incremental cycling test to exhaustion using a recumbent cycle ergometer\nfollowing the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine,44using a portable and validated gas\nanalyzer.45Blood pressure and heart rate will also be analyzed at rest and during the exercise test.\nDietary and physical activity assessment\nThe participants will have to fill a dietary record using image-assisted method over three days (two consecutive weekdaysand one weekend day) before and after the supplementation period for estimation of macronutrient intake.\n46Similarly,\nparticipants will answer the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) to assess their physical activity.47\nBlood samples\nBlood samples will be collected after an overnight fast (12 h) using a needle and Vacutainer kit and will be immediatelycentrifuged to obtain plasma (1000 /C2g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C) and erythrocyte fractions (3000 /C2g for 10 min at 20\u00b0C). Both\nfractions will be frozen at /C080\u00b0C until further analysis. A portion of venous blood will also be collected in Leuko-\nLOCK\u2122Total RNA Isolation System for the capture and purification of intact RNA from white blood cells, which will\nbe frozen and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until further processing.\nClinical, cardiometabolic, and inflammatory blood measurements\nPlasma rheumatoid factor (RF) and lipid profile will be determined. Further, plasma interleukin-10, and TNF- \u03b1levels will\nbe measured via commercial ELISA assay kits.\nLeukocyte gene expression\ncDNA will be prepared by reverse transcription of 1 ug of total RNA, using the SensiFASTTM cDNA Synthesis Kit\n(Bioline) according to manufacturer \u2019s protocol. RNA quantity and quality will be assessed using a Nanodrop 8000\n(ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara,\nCalifornia, USA), respectively. Real-time RT-qPCR will be carried out to quantify the changes in the expression of genes\nPage 6 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:942 Last updated: 08 JUN 2024\nassociated with inflammatory pathways and SPM synthesis, including TNF- \u03b1, interleukin-1 \u03b2(IL-1 \u03b2), IL-6,\ncyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), lipoxygenase-5 (ALOX5), lipooxygenase-12 (ALOX12), lipooxygenase-15 (ALOX15),\nand calcium-independent phospholipase A2 VIA (iPLA2VIA). 18S ribosomal RNA (18SRNA) and glyceraldehyde\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) will be used as housekeeping genes. Data will be analyzed using the \u0394\u0394Ct\nmethod.\nSynovial fluid extraction\nAll individuals must obtain medical clearance from their Rheumatologist. RA subjects will attend the laboratory after an\novernight fast, without having carried out any type of exercise in the previous 48 hours. Local anesthesia (1% Lidocaine)will be applied to the affected joint and synovial fluid will be obtained by a certified rheumatologist.\n48Synovial fluid will\nbe immediately placed on ice and aliquoted for specific analyses. All aliquots will be stored at /C080\u00b0C until use.\nPhospholipid fatty acid composition\nQuantitative extraction of total lipids from erythrocytes, plasma, and synovial fluid will be carried out according to Blighand Dyer\n49with the addition of BHT. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from erythrocytes and plasma will be prepared\naccording to Morrison and Smith.50FAMEs will be extracted with 0.5 mL of hexane. FAMEs will be identified and\nquantified using a gas-liquid chromatograph (Agilent7890B, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a capillary column(Agilent HP-88, 100 m /C20.250 mm; I.D. 0.25 \u03bcm) and flame ionization detector (FID). Identification and quantification\nof FAMEs will be achieved by comparing the retention times and the peak area% values of unknown samples to those of a\ncommercial lipid standard (Nu-Chek Prep Inc., Elysian, MN, USA). C23:0 will be used as internal standard (Nu-ChekPrep Inc., Elysian, MN, USA) and data will be processed using the Hewlett-Packard Chemstation software system.\nAnalyses of SPMs\nPlasma and synovial fluid samples (400 \u03bcL) will be analyzed in duplicate for oxylipins by HPLC/MS/MS, as\npreviously described.\n51Briefly, deuterated internal standards (Cayman Chemicals) will be added to plasma samples\nand adjusted to pH <3.0 prior to solid-phase extraction using Strata-X-SPE (Phenomenex) columns preconditioned with\nmethanol, followed by pH 3.0 water. Samples will be loaded on the columns, washed, and free SPMs will be eluted with\n100% methanol. The eluate will subsequently be dried and resuspended in solvent A (water/acetonitrile/formic acid,70/30/0.02 v/v/v) for oxylipin analysis by HPLC/MS/MS, using a Luna 5- \u03bcm C18 column (100 \u00c5, 250 /C22.0 mm,\nPhenomenex) on a Shimadzu Nexera XR HPLC, coupled to an ABSciex QTRAP 6500 MS operating in negative mode\nwith electrospray ionization. Oxylipins will be eluted with the following gradient: 100% solvent A between 0 and 1 min,\nand then solvent B (acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol, 50/50, v/v) is increased linearly to 25% at 3 min, to 45% at 11 min, to60% at 13 min, to 75% at 18 min, and to 90% at 18.5 min. Solvent B will then be held at 90% until minute 20, dropped\nto 0% by 21 min, and held until 25 min. Quantification of oxylipins will be performed using a stable isotope dilution\nmethod.\nStatistical analysis\nResults will be expressed as mean /C6SD. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Fisher \u2019s least\nsignificant difference post-test for multiple comparisons between groups will be used. Linear regression models will be\nconstructed to examine the association between SPMs and clinical, functional, and health parameters, accounting forparticipant age, sex, and BMI as covariates. A value of p<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.\nDissemination\nThe results will be communicated to the funding body through a formal report. Further, they will be communicated to the\nparticipants and the interested public at the Universidad de O \u2019Higgins and will be disseminated through presentations at\nnational and international scientific conferences. The study outcomes will be published through peer-reviewed journals,\nno matter the trial outcome. There is no limit to the publication of the trial results.\nStudy statusThe recruitment of participants will begin during the winter (June-September) of 2023. The data collection of this study\nwill be completed in December 2024.\nDiscussion\nRA is a chronic autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation around the joints leading tosubstantial damage of the cartilages, bones, tendons, and ligaments, significantly affecting overall function, quality oflife, and increasing the propensity of mortality. The current treatments for patients with RA (DMARDs, NSAIDs, and\nPage 7 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:942 Last updated: 08 JUN 2024\nanti-TNF biologics) intend to disrupt the inflammatory response and slow disease progression; however, their chronic\nconsumption may lead to unwanted side effects (immunosuppression and infections) and prevent optimal resolution and\ntissue repair, which is imperative in RA. Further, the lack of robust and sensitive biomarkers to determine treatment\nresponsiveness in RA has impeded proper tracing and development of novel individualized interventions. Therefore,elucidating the SPMs, as well as the underlying inflammatory and SPM synthesis transcriptional pathways, associatedwith the improvements in disease progression, cardiometabolic health, and quality of life after n-3 PUFA supplemen-\ntation and AEx training could lead to the development of new markers and individualized treatment strategies that\nimprove overall health and quality of life in RA individuals. Finally, these results could prompt the development of newpharmacological treatments that enhance the production of the SPMs observed after n-3 PUFA supplementation and AEx\ntraining to improve treatment outcomes in RA individuals.\nEthical considerations\nDue to ethical considerations (divergent inflamed joints between participants), we will only perform the synovial fluidprocedure in a small subset of patients from each intervention group. We will ensure that all individuals receive the best\nmedical attention before, during, and after the procedure. Before a participant is eligible, a full medical screening will be\nperformed to assess any risks. The individuals will be followed up routinely 48 h after the procedure to check if anycomplication occurs, which is unlikely. If a complication occurs, the principal investigator of this study will take care of\nall associated medical procedure costs and will seek the best treatment for the participant.\nThis study received ethics approval from the Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica de Investigaci \u00f3n en Seres Humanos #219-2021\n(Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile). All participants must sign a consent form prior participation in the study.\nRegistration and reporting guidelines\nThis trial has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ,#NCT05945693 . The construction of this study protocol followed\nthe Interventional Trials 2013 (SPIRIT) guidelines.\nData availability\nNo data are associated with this article.\nReferences\n1.

After careful review we have \nhighlighted some points/comments that we believe will improve the overall quality of the study \nand reporting of the final manuscript.  \n \nIntroduction:\nAre there specific/published measures of function for RA? What are the key outcomes used \nto support this point?1. \nMore info would benefit the connection between RA and development of metabolic disease.2. \nWhat is the burden of increased healthcare cost- is it on the individual or society?3. \nSpecify meaningful clinical and functional outcomes4. \nIs the n-3 PUFA incorporated freely into the blood, or is it its incorporation into blood cells \nthat have possible positive effects?5. \nExpand on the proposed function/mechanisms SPMs act through.6. \nIs there proposed interaction between the AEx and N-3 only groups? How might these \ncompare to the combined group? Do you suspect and additive effect of the combined \nintervention?7. \nGeneral methods:\nWhat is the time frame of intervention vs. observation? Is this suitable to measure disease \nprogression?1. \nSample size: Why use morning stiffness for power calculation? Will this be the primary \noutcome? Is this the most influential factor clinically?2. \nWhat is the significance of this prednisone dose and why is it grounds for exclusion?3. \nValidation for excluding drinkers and smokers?4. \nGeneral design:\nIs there a specific time frame to recruit 88 participants? If there is more than 22% drop out, 1. \n\u00a0Page 10 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:942 Last updated: 08 JUN 2024\nwill you recruit more than 22 people per group?\nCan this study be considered double blind if the PI is aware of group allocation?2. \nWhat is the peak aerobic test used? What does the physical activity assessment consist of- is \nit self-reported?3. \nWould it be worthwhile to include more timepoints? Even just for blood and synovial fluid to \nsee the time course of n-3 saturation?4. \nWhy not try to recruit everyone for synovial fluid extraction?5. \nIs morning stiffness clinically meaningful? Does this measure alone influence quality of life \nor similar outcomes6. \nWhy were these doses of DHA and EPA chosen specifically?7. \nIs there any concern that gelatin may confound results due to possible implications on joint \nhealth?8. \nWill the progression of exercise be standardized relative to time?9. \nAre the phone calls with compliance questions the same call/frequency as the adherence \nreminder?10. \nWhen is the participant asked to report this measure? On the phone, in person, or in \nwriting? Will this involve active recall? Could this influence their reporting?11. \nAgain, what is the clinical significance of morning stiffness?12. \nWill analgesic used be reported with respect to body mass or sex?13. \nHandgrip assessment should be across a standardized time14. \nDiscussion:\nWhat are some of the primary markers of inflammation for this disease?1. \nOther (pre reported RCT):\nStatus is listed as not recruiting, but is supposed to be done by Dec 2024?1. \nOmega-3 combined with exercise is not listed as a separate intervention2. \nCan masking be considered quadruple if the PI knows group allocation3. \n \nChris McGlory and Danielle Nyman.\n \nIs the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?\nYes\nIs the study design appropriate for the research question?\nYes\nAre sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?\nYes\nAre the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?\nNot applicable\nCompeting Interests:  No competing interests were disclosed.\nReviewer Expertise:  Skeletal muscle, nutrition\n\u00a0Page 11 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:942 Last updated: 08 JUN 2024\nWe confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level \nof expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have \nsignificant reservations, as outlined above.\nReviewer Report \u00a021 May 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.5256/f1000research.151582.r276501\n\u00a9 2024 Calder P.
