Thirty rats\nwere divided into five groups. All groups except the normal control group were given CCl 4to induce\nliver damage. The other groups received treatments with gum acacia, silymarin, dapagliflozin, or a\ncombination of dapagliflozin and silymarin for 14 days. The results show that both dapagliflozin and\nsilymarin, alone and combined, significantly reduced liver damage markers in the blood compared\nto the group that only received CCl 4. Additionally, these treatments lowered levels of inflammatory\nsubstances and increased antioxidant enzyme levels in the liver. The combination of dapagliflozin and\nsilymarin was especially effective, suggesting they work well together to protect the liver. This study\nhighlights the potential of dapagliflozin and silymarin in preventing liver damage by influencing\nspecific protective pathways in the body.\nAbstract: This study was aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective potential of dapagliflozin and\nsilymarin alone and in combination to combat carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4)-induced hepatotoxicity\nand the anticipated mechanisms. Thirty female Wistar rats were randomly allocated into five different\ngroups. All the experimental animals except the normal control (Group I) were administered CCl 4.\nAdditionally, Groups II, III, IV , and V were treated with gum acacia, silymarin, dapagliflozin, and a\ncombination of dapagliflozin and silymarin, respectively, for 14 days. Dapagliflozin, silymarin alone,\nand in combination, significantly reduced ( p< 0.05) serum levels of ALT, AST, AST:ALT ratio, and\ntotal bilirubin compared to CCl 4-intoxicated control rats. There was a notable reduction ( p< 0.05)\nobserved in the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, nitrites, and 4-hydroxynonenal, accompanied by\nan elevation in catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, nuclear erythroid 2-related\nfactor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in liver homogenates of the groups treated with\ndapagliflozin, silymarin alone, and in combination, as compared to the CCl 4-intoxicated control\ngroup. Dapagliflozin in combination with silymarin showed a synergistic hepatoprotective effect.\nOur study reveals the profound hepatoprotective potential of dapagliflozin alone and in combination\nwith silymarin in CCl 4-intoxicated Wistar rats by modulating the Nrf2 and HO-1 signaling pathways.\nKeywords: sodium\u2013glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors; hepatotoxicity; liver diseases; non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease; oxidative stress; repurposing; antidiabetics\nBiology 2024 ,13, 473. https://doi.org/10.3390/biology13070473 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biology\nBiology 2024 ,13, 473 2 of 16\n1. Introduction\nThe liver is a vital organ within the human body. It constitutes about 2% of an adult\u2019s\nbody weight, yet it processes approximately 25% of the total cardiac output [ 1]. The liver\nfilters blood from the gastrointestinal tract, detecting and metabolizing molecu-lar signals\nand foreign substances. It processes and eliminates internal and external compounds, stores\nand regulates essential nutrients, and synthesizes vital proteins, bile acids, hormones, and\nregulatory molecules. The liver also supports the immune system by clearing microorgan-\nisms and toxins from the blood. It is a main target for toxic effects from foreign substances\nand pathogens, often damaged by metabolizing chemicals, drugs, and pollutants due to its\nhigh blood flow and metabolic activity.\nHepatotoxicity, characterized by liver damage induced by chemical substances, re-\nmains a significant global health concern. Liver disease contributes to over two million\ndeaths annually, including those attributed to cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, and liver cancer,\nmaking up 4% of global mortality, which translates to approximately one out of every\n25 deaths [ 2]. Among these fatalities, liver cancer alone is responsible for between 600,000\nto 900,000 deaths [ 3]. Although liver disease currently ranks as the eleventh-leading cause\nof death globally, there is a possibility that the actual number of liver-related deaths is\nunderestimated [ 2]. One of the studies has reported that the increase in mortality in cir-\nrhosis is higher in comparison with other chronic conditions [ 4]. Liver diseases remain\na critical challenge in clinical practice due to their complex pathogenesis and limited\ntherapeutic options.\nCCl 4-induced hepatotoxicity is extensively used as an experimental model to study\nthe mechanisms of liver injury and to screen potential hepatoprotective agents [ 5]. A\nCCl 4-induced hepatotoxicity model mimics the pathophysiology of human liver diseases\nsuch as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 5,6]. The pathogenesis of CCl 4-\ninduced hepatotoxicity involves oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, with reactive\noxygen species (ROS) playing a crucial role [ 7]. The metabolic activation of CCl 4by hep-\natic cytochrome P450 enzymes generates trichloromethyl radicals (CCl 3\u2022), which trigger\nlipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA damage, leading to hepatic necrosis and\nfibrosis [8].\nDespite significant advancements in modern medicine, liver diseases continue to be a\nsignificant public health issue, underscoring the need for new, side-effect-free medications.\nA significant focus has been placed on investigating therapeutic agents that can mitigate\nliver damage through antioxidant mechanisms [ 9]. Some of the studies have reported that\nplant extracts like silymarin, derived from the seeds of Silybum marianum, commonly\nknown as milk thistle, are used to treat liver diseases [ 10\u201314]. Research has highlighted\nits strong hepatoprotective antioxidant properties, which are achieved by inhibiting lipid\nperoxidation [15,16].\nThe strategy of repurposing existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes is becoming\nmore prominent in drug discovery and development due to its potential to expedite\ntreatment availability for various medical conditions. Repurposing existing drugs offers\nnumerous advantages, including cost savings, reduced development time, and improved\npatient outcomes [17].\nSGLT2 inhibitors, initially developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have\ngarnered attention due to their multifaceted effects beyond glycemic control. Dapagliflozin,\na selective SGLT2 inhibitor, has shown antioxidative, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory\neffects in various experimental models [ 18]. While primarily known for its antihyper-\nglycemic effects, recent studies reveal its broad impacts, including weight loss, cardio-\nvascular benefits, and improvements in metabolic parameters [ 19,20]. Dapagliflozin\u2019s\nantioxidant effects, such as reduced ROS production and modulation of Ca2+influx, along\nwith its anti-inflammatory properties, suggest its potential in mitigating CCl 4-induced\nhepatotoxicity [ 21]. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) are known to express\nboth SGLT-1 and SGLT-2 co-transporters [ 22]. Additionally, SGLT-2 has been observed in\nimmortalized normal human hepatocyte-derived liver cells (L02) and immortalized human\nBiology 2024 ,13, 473 3 of 16\nprimary hepatocyte cells (HuS-E/2) [ 23]. Some of the in vitro studies have reported that\nSGLT-2 inhibitors exhibit anti-proliferative effects in various hepatocellular cell lines, partly\nby reducing glucose uptake [ 24,25]. Our study aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective\npotential of dapagliflozin in an established model of CCl 4-induced liver injury and explore\nthe molecular mechanisms of dapagliflozin\u2019s effects by concentrating on the Nrf2/HO-1\nsignaling pathway. This research endeavor seeks to enhance comprehension and treatment\nstrategies for oxidative stress-associated liver diseases.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Drugs and Reagents\nThe active pharmaceutical ingredient of silymarin was sourced from Sigma-Aldrich-\nMerck Limited, Bangalore, India. Dapagliflozin was acquired from AstraZeneca. Colorimet-\nric assay kits for ALT, AST, and total bilirubin were obtained from Alliance Global, Dubai,\nUnited Arab Emirates. Fasting blood glucose glucometer strips were purchased from Life\nPharmacy, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Colorimetric assay kits for glutathione peroxidase,\ncatalase, SOD, nitrites, and rat ELISA kits for 4-HNE, IL-1 \u03b2, IL-6, TNF- \u03b1, Nrf2, and HO-1\nwere procured from Elabscience, United States through the Scientechnic, a distributor based\nin the UAE. All laboratory-grade chemicals including carbon tetrachloride were obtained\nthrough local distributors in the UAE.\n2.2. Animals\nThirty adult female Wistar rats ranging from 8\u201310 weeks old and weighing 150\u2013200 g\nwere bred at the Central Animal Research Facility, Ras Al Khaimah Medical and Health\nSciences University (RAKMHSU), UAE. These animals were housed in controlled conditions\nincluding a 12 h dark/12 h light cycle, temperatures between 22\u201324\u25e6C, and relative air\nhumidity of 40\u201360%. They had a regular supply of tap water and a normal rat pellet diet\nconsisting of standard calories. After a week of acclimatization to the research animal holding\nroom, the rats were randomly allocated into various groups. Ethics approval was taken from\nthe RAKMHSU Research and Ethics Committee (RAKMHSU-REC-014-2022/23-UG-M).\n2.3. Rationale for Dose Selection of Carbon Tetrachloride, Silymarin, and Dapagliflozin and\nTheir Dissolution\nHepatotoxicity was induced by administering 1:1 mixture of CCl 4and olive oil;\n(1.59 mg/kg and 0.92 mg/kg, respectively, ~1 mL/kg; i.p. every 48 h) [ 11,12,14]. We\nhave earlier reported the hepatoprotective dose of silymarin as 50 mg/kg/day for Wistar\nrats [ 7,9,11\u201314]. The US FDA-approved dose for the antidiabetic effect of dapagliflozin\nin humans is 10 mg/day. According to Paget and Barnes\u2019 body surface area ratio, the\nhuman dose was converted to the rat dose equivalent of 0.9 mg/kg/day. Silymarin and\ndapagliflozin were each dissolved in 2% gum acacia and administered orally.\n2.4. Experimental Design\nFollowing the measurement of baseline body weight, 30 adult female Wistar rats\n(8\u201310 weeks old) were randomly divided into five groups ( n= 6/group). The treatment\nregimen followed for 14 days between 10 and 11 AM every day is mentioned below:\nGroup I (Normal healthy control): Olive oil (1 mL/kg; i.p. every 48 h) + 2% gum\nacacia (1 mL/kg/day; p.o.)\nGroup II (Negative control): CCl 4-intoxicated hepatotoxic control rats (1:1 mixture of\nCCl 4and olive oil; 1 mL/kg; i.p. every 48 h) + 2% gum acacia (1 mL/kg/day; p.o.)\nGroup III (Positive control; CCl 4+ silymarin): CCl 4-intoxicated hepatotoxic rats (1:1 mix-\nture of CCl 4and olive oil; 1 mL/kg; i.p. every 48 h) + silymarin (50 mg/kg/day; p.o.)\nGroup IV (Test; CCl 4+ dapagliflozin): CCl 4-intoxicated hepatotoxic rats (1:1 mixture\nof CCl 4and olive oil; 1 mL/kg; i.p. every 48 h) + dapagliflozin (0.9 mg/kg/day; p.o.)\nBiology 2024 ,13, 473 4 of 16\nGroup V (Test; CCl 4+ silymarin + dapagliflozin): CCl 4-intoxicated hepatotoxic rats\n(1:1 mixture of CCl 4and olive oil; 1 mL/kg; i.p. every 48 h) + silymarin (50 mg/kg/day;\np.o. + dapagliflozin 0.9 mg/kg/day; p.o.)\nThe body weight was monitored weekly during the experiment. On 15th day, overnight\nfasted experimental rats were anesthetized by administering ketamine (60 mg/kg) and\nxylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Fasting blood glucose was estimated by glucose\noxidase\u2013peroxide reactive strips using a glucometer after the fasting blood samples were\nobtained from their tail vein (tail tip).\n2.5. Collection of Blood and Serum Preparation\nBlood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus of veins using capillary tubes and\ntransferred into microcentrifuge tubes. The serum was then isolated from the whole\nblood by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4 degrees Celsius (\u25e6C) for 20 min in a cooling\ncentrifuge. Subsequently, the supernatant was stored at \u221280 degrees Celsius (\u25e6C) for\nbiochemical analysis.\n2.6. Collection of the Liver and Its Gross Examination\nAnesthetized animals were euthanized after the blood collection. Animals were placed\nin a recumbent supine position on the animal operation table. An incision was made on\nthe ventral aspect of the anterior abdominal wall by using a surgical scalpel to open the\nabdominal cavity. The liver was collected from the right upper quadrant of the abdomen\nby dissecting it from the abdominal muscles, fascia, visceral fats, and major blood vessels.\nGross morphological examination of the liver was performed. The liver was then washed\nin regular saline and soaked on blotting paper to extract the blood. Half of the liver was\nused to prepare its homogenate for biochemical estimations, and the other half was kept in\n10% formalin for histopathological analysis.\n2.7. Liver Homogenate Preparation\nA 10% liver homogenate was prepared in a cold potassium phosphate buffer of 50 mM\nconcentration and pH 7.4 using tissue homogenizer. Following further centrifugation at\n3000 rpm for 10 min, the resultant supernatant was stored at \u221280 degrees Celsius (\u25e6C).\n2.8. Biochemical Estimations in Serum and Liver Homogenates\nALT, AST, and total bilirubin levels in the serum were determined using standard\nprotocols outlined in their respective assay kits, employing a colorimetric method with an\nautoanalyzer. SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and nitrite levels were measured following colorimetric\nassay protocols provided with the kits, with optical density readings taken at 540 nm,\n340 nm, 405 nm, and 550 nm, respectively, using a microplate reader.\nRat-specific 4-HNE levels in liver homogenate were estimated using Competitive\nELISA principle. The micro ELISA plate provided was pre-coated with 4-HNE. During the\nreaction, 4-HNE in samples or standards competed with a fixed amount of 4-HNE on the\nsolid phase supporter for sites on the Biotinylated Detection Ab specific to 4-HNE. Excess\nconjugate and unbound samples or standards were washed, followed by the addition of\navidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to each well and incubation. Subse-\nquently, a TMB substrate solution was added to each well. The enzyme\u2013substrate reaction\nwas halted with stop solution, and the color change was measured spectrophotometrically\nat a wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate reader. 4-HNE concentration in the samples\nwas determined by comparing their OD to the standard curve.\nRat-specific Nrf2, HO-1, IL-1 \u03b2, IL-6, and TNF- \u03b1levels in liver homogenate were\nassessed via sandwich ELISA principle. The provided micro ELISA plates were pre-coated\nwith antibodies specific to rat Nrf2/HO-1/IL-1 \u03b2/IL-6/TNF- \u03b1. Samples (or standards) were\nadded to the wells and combined with the specific antibody. Subsequently, a biotinylated\ndetection antibody specific for rat Nrf2/HO-1/IL-1 \u03b2/IL-6/TNF- \u03b1and avidin horseradish\nperoxidase (HRP) conjugate was added sequentially to each well and incubated. After\nBiology 2024 ,13, 473 5 of 16\nwashing away free components, substrate solution was added to each well. Wells contain-\ning rat Nrf2/HO-1/IL-1 \u03b2/IL-6/TNF- \u03b1, biotinylated detection antibody, and avidin-HRP\nconjugate exhibited a blue coloration. The enzyme\u2013substrate reaction was stopped with\nstop solution, resulting in a yellow color change. Optical density (OD) was measured\nspectrophotometrically at 450 nm using a microplate reader, with OD values proportional\nto the concentration of rat Nrf2/HO-1/IL-1 \u03b2/IL-6/TNF- \u03b1. Concentrations in the samples\nwere calculated by comparing their OD to the standard curve.\n2.9. Qualitative Histopathological Examination of Liver\nLiver tissue specimens were obtained from every group and fixed in a 10% phosphate-\nbuffered formalin solution. Furthermore, a small portion of each liver sample was cut and\ndehydrated using increasing concentrations of ethyl alcohol (50% for 24 h, 70% for 24 h, 90%\nfor 12 h, and 100% for 12 h), cleared with 99.14% xylene until the tissues became transparent\nand embedded in molten paraffin wax. After 24 h, 6-micron-thick paraffin sections were\nsliced using a microtome and affixed onto albumenized glass slides, with appropriate\nlabeling. These sections underwent de-waxing in 99.14% xylene for 10 min, followed by\nhydration through decreasing ethyl alcohol concentrations for 2 min in each 100%, 90%,\n70%, and 50% and finally in the distilled water for 10 min. Subsequently, the sections were\nstained with commercially prepared Harris hematoxylin for 5 min. Thereafter, sections\nwere kept in running tap water for 10 min. Further, staining was performed with 2% eosin\nfor 2 min. Later, sections were washed in 90% alcohol for 2 min and in 100% alcohol for\nanother 2 min. Later, sections were cleared in 99.14% xylene. Finally, 2\u20133 drops of DPX\nmountant were applied onto the slides, and coverslips were gently placed to prevent tissue\ndrying. The prepared slides were then examined for any morphological changes under a\nlight microscope (Olympus BX53, Olympus Life Science Solutions, Tokyo, Japan) at 100 \u00d7\nand 400 \u00d7magnifications. Later, photomicrographs of the liver cell slides were captured\nand qualitatively analyzed.\n2.10. Statistical Analysis\nUsing SPSS version 29, normally distributed data were presented as mean \u00b1standard\ndeviation. Thereafter, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted followed by\na post hoc Tukey\u2019s test. Statistical significance was defined as p< 0.05.\n3. Results\n3.1. Impact on Liver Function Test\nThe liver function test revealed a significant increase in serum ALT (52.13 \u00b13.39;\np= 0.002 ), AST (221.41 \u00b133.13; p< 0.001), AST:ALT ratio (4.23 \u00b10.46; p< 0.001), and\nTB levels (0.87 \u00b10.16; p< 0.001) for the CCl 4-intoxicated hepatotoxic control group in\ncontrast to the normal control rats (ALT: 43.78 \u00b12.53; AST: 119.86 \u00b115.24; AST:ALT ratio:\n2.73\u00b10.30; and TB: 0.36 \u00b10.11). On the other hand, the administration of dapagliflozin to\nthe CCl 4-intoxicated hepatotoxic rats led to a considerable decrease in ALT ( 37.22\u00b14.64;\np< 0.001 ), AST (122.29 \u00b18.51; p< 0.001), AST:ALT ratio (3.33 \u00b10.51; p= 0.018), and\nTB (0.39 \u00b10.07; p< 0.001) in comparison to the CCl 4-intoxicated hepatotoxic control\ngroup.

Discussion\nThis study employed a comprehensive approach, including biochemical, histological,\nand molecular analyses, to uncover the molecular mechanisms that protect against carbon\ntetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity through the use of dapagliflozin. The results enhance\nour understanding of dapagliflozin\u2019s varied effects and provide detailed insights into the\nhepatoprotective properties of both dapagliflozin and silymarin in the context of CCl 4-\ninduced liver damage. This is demonstrated by changes in liver function, inflammatory\nmarkers, oxidative stress biomarkers, modulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway,\nand noticeable gross and histopathological changes in the liver.\nCarbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) has been widely used in experimental models to in-\nvestigate the cellular mechanisms behind oxidative damage [ 26]. CCl 4is activated by\ncytochrome P-4502E, 2B1, 2B2, and possibly CYP 3A to form the trichloromethyl radical\n(CCl3\u2022) and trichloromethyl peroxy radical (CCl3OO\u2022), leading to lipid peroxidation and\nsubsequent tissue damage [ 8]. Enhanced lipid peroxidation, coupled with the depletion of\nantioxidants in tissues, results in structural changes in the endoplasmic reticulum and other\nmembranes, loss of metabolic enzyme activation, reduced protein synthesis, and elevated\nlevels of serum transaminases, total bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin, culminating in\nliver damage [ 27]. The leakage of cellular enzymes into plasma indicates hepatic tissue\ndamage. Alanine transaminase (ALT) is considered an important diagnostic marker of liver\ninjury [ 28]. The marked increase in serum ALT, AST, AST:ALT ratio, and total bilirubin\nin the CCl 4-intoxicated hepatotoxic control rats highlights the extent of liver damage. Da-\npagliflozin, both alone and in combination with silymarin, exhibited a significant decrease\nin these indicators, suggesting a protective effect on the liver. Our observations concerning\ndapagliflozin\u2019s positive impacts on liver function align with studies emphasizing its ability\nto mitigate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in diabetic animal models [29\u201331]. These find-\nings are consistent with our previous reports on CCl 4-induced elevation of hepatic injury\nbiomarkers in serum [11,12,14].\nNotably, the combined treatment of dapagliflozin and silymarin significantly enhanced\nliver function, suggesting a synergistic effect. Gross and histopathological examinations of\nliver tissues further support the hepatoprotective effects of dapagliflozin and silymarin.\nRats treated with either dapagliflozin or silymarin, especially in the combination group,\nexhibited a restoration of liver structure resembling the healthy control group. This obser-\nvation is consistent with biochemical markers, reinforcing the potential therapeutic benefits\nof these interventions.\nCCl 4-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 32].\nOxidative stress can elevate levels of inflammatory cytokines. Reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) generated during oxidative stress can activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF- \u03baB), a key\ntranscription factor that promotes the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines\nsuch as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- \u03b1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 \u03b2), and interleukin-6\n(IL-6). This link between oxidative stress and inflammation underscores the intricate inter-\nplay between oxidative damage and the immune response, contributing to the pathogenesis\nof various diseases [ 33]. Dapagliflozin exhibited a significant reduction in IL-1 beta, IL-6,\nand TNF-alpha, aligning with studies emphasizing its anti-inflammatory effects [34\u201336] .\nThe combination of dapagliflozin and silymarin displayed a robust suppression of inflam-\nmatory biomarkers, indicating a potential synergistic effect.\nOxidative stress is pivotal in CCl 4-induced liver damage [ 7,8]. Dapagliflozin sig-\nnificantly reduced nitrites and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), while increasing antioxidant\nenzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase\n(GSH-Px), supporting studies that highlight dapagliflozin\u2019s antioxidative potential [ 37,38]\nand silymarin\u2019s effects [ 39]. The combination therapy showed a comprehensive improve-\nment, underscoring a synergistic effect in combating oxidative stress. Nrf2, a protective\ntranscription factor sensitive to redox changes, regulates detoxification gene activation,\nsafeguarding cells from oxidative stress. During oxidative stress, Nrf2 dissociates from\nKeap1 and enters the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in\nBiology 2024 ,13, 473 13 of 16\nthe promoter region of genes encoding numerous antioxidant enzymes like SOD, GSH-Px,\nCAT, and phase II detoxification enzymes, such as NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1\n(NQO1), to counteract oxidative stress [ 40]. The Nrf2/HO-1 pathway coordinates the\nantioxidant response, playing critical roles in cellular defense against oxidative stress and\ninflammation. Activation of this pathway upregulates various antioxidant and cytopro-\ntective genes, contributing to cellular homeostasis. Nrf2 activation has been shown to\nenhance the expression of SOD isoforms, including SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3, in response to\noxidative stress [ 41]. These enzymes scavenge superoxide radicals and are crucial in cellular\nantioxidant defense. Although direct evidence linking Nrf2 to catalase regulation is limited,\nstudies show the interplay between Nrf2 and catalase in protecting cells from oxidative\nstress [ 42]. Nrf2 activation indirectly enhances catalase activity by modulating the cellular\nredox environment. Activation of Nrf2 also leads to the transcriptional upregulation of\nGSH-Px, as demonstrated in various studies [ 43]. GSH-Px enzymes reduce hydrogen\nperoxide and organic hydroperoxides using reduced glutathione, thus protecting cells\nfrom oxidative damage. The Nrf2/HO-1 pathway has been shown to reduce nitrite levels\nindirectly by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation [ 44]. Activation of Nrf2 inhibits\nnitric oxide (NO) production and oxidative stress-induced nitrosative damage. Activation\nof the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway mitigates lipid peroxidation and reduces 4-HNE accumulation\nin various cellular models [ 45]. Nrf2 activation induces the expression of HO-1, which\ninhibits 4-HNE-induced oxidative damage by promoting its metabolism [46\u201348].\nIn our study, CCl 4exposure resulted in a notable decrease in Nrf2 and HO-1 levels,\nindicating compromised antioxidant defense. Dapagliflozin significantly modulated these\nmarkers, highlighting its role in enhancing the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. The combination ther-\napy exhibited strong activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 axis, suggesting a potential mechanism\nfor the observed antioxidative effects, including increased levels of enzymatic antioxidant\nparameters such as GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT along with decreased levels of non-enzymatic\nantioxidant parameters like 4-HNE and nitrites. The amelioration of a CCl 4-induced de-\ncline in liver function, inflammation, oxidative stress, and normalization of hepatocellular\narchitecture may be attributed to the upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 by dapagliflozin alone\nand in combination with silymarin. Our results underscore the therapeutic promise of\nfocusing on Nrf2/HO-1 in addressing different pathological conditions linked to oxidative\nstress and inflammation. One of the studies reported that dapagliflozin recovered choles-\nterol metabolism functions in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice liver via activating\nthe antioxidant Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, highlighting the involvement of this pathway in\ndapagliflozin-mediated hepatoprotection protection [ 49]. Emerging evidence suggests\nthat dapagliflozin exerts its hepatoprotective effects through modulation of key signaling\npathways. The Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, known for its role in cellular defense against oxidative\nstress, appears to be activated by dapagliflozin.\nOur study boasts several strengths, employing a multidimensional approach encom-\npassing biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses to thoroughly evaluate liver\nfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and underlying molecular mechanisms. We\ninvestigated the potential repurposing effect of the well-established antidiabetic drug da-\npagliflozin at a dosage of 0.9 mg/kg/day, equivalent to the human therapeutic dose of\n10 mg/day, without compromising safety considerations. Our research delves into the\nmechanistic underpinnings of the hepatoprotective effects, particularly emphasizing the\nmodulation of the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling path-\nway, which enhances antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses. However, our study\ndoes have limitations. These include a small sample size and the use of a rat model of CCl 4-\ninduced hepatotoxicity potentially limiting its representation of human physiology and\npathophysiology and thus restricting the generalizability of the findings to clinical settings.\nAlthough our study sheds light on the hepatoprotective potential of dapagliflozin and its\ncombination with silymarin in carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity, addressing the\naforementioned limitations would bolster the robustness and applicability of our findings.\nBiology 2024 ,13, 473 14 of 16\n5. Conclusions\nThe present study reveals the substantial hepatoprotective potential of dapagliflozin\nalone and in combination with silymarin in carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity\nmodel in Wistar rats by upregulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Silymarin and\ndapagliflozin combination therapy demonstrated synergistic effects across various param-\neters, surpassing the individual effects of dapagliflozin and silymarin. These promising\nfindings suggest that co-administering dapagliflozin and silymarin could be an effective\ntherapeutic strategy for mitigating CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. This study is significant\nas it explores a novel therapeutic use for dapagliflozin beyond its established role in dia-\nbetes management. Exploring the translational potential of dapagliflozin and silymarin in\ncombating hepatotoxicity holds promise for improving clinical outcomes.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.M.S.; methodology, S.M.S.; software, S.M.S., L.A.,\nand M.A.; validation, S.M.S.; formal analysis, S.M.S., L.K.B., A.R., M.A., L.A., K.E., Y.J., and A.B.;\ninvestigation, S.M.S., L.K.B., A.R., M.A., L.A., K.E., A.B., and Y.J.; resources, S.M.S., L.K.B., and\nA.R.; data curation, S.M.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.M.S.; writing\u2014review and editing,\nS.M.S., L.K.B., and A.R.; visualization, S.M.S., L.K.B., A.R., M.A., L.A., K.E., Y.J., and A.B.; supervision,\nS.M.S.; project administration, S.M.S.
