Vitamin B-6 as pyridoxal-5 #-phosphate (PLP) is required\nas the coenzyme in the formation of glutathione precursors. Despitethis obligatory role of PLP, previous studies from this laboratory\nshowed that vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency caused elevated glutathione\nconcentrations in rat liver and human plasma.Objective: Our aim was to determine the effect of marginal vitamin\nB-6 de\ufb01ciency (plasma PLP 20\u201330 nmol/L) on the rate of red blood\ncell (RBC) glutathione synthesis.Design: We measured plasma and RBC glutathione concentrations\nand the fractional and absolute synthesis rates of RBC glutathione\nusing the stable-isotope-labeled glutathione precursor [1,2-\n13C2]gly-\ncine in 13 healthy volunteers aged 21\u201339 y.Results: Dietary vitamin B-6 restriction did not signi\ufb01cantly affect\nthe glutathione concentration in plasma (6.9 61.9 compared with\n6.761.1lmol/L) or RBCs (2068 650 compared with 2117 648\nlmol/L). For RBC glutathione, the mean fractional synthesis rates\nwere 54 65%/d and 43 64%/d ( P= 0.10), and the absolute\nsynthesis rates were 1116 6100 and 916 692lmol /C1L\n21/C1d21\n(P= 0.14) before and after vitamin B-6 restriction, respectively.\nConclusions: Marginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency tended to decrease\nmean RBC glutathione synthesis with no effect on RBC glutathioneconcentration, but the responses varied widely among individuals.Because the cysteine concentration in plasma and RBC did not\nchange during vitamin B-6 restriction, we conclude that the effects\nof marginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency on glutathione synthesis are notcaused by altered precursor concentrations. Am J Clin Nutr\n2009;90:336\u201343.\nINTRODUCTION\nGlutathione is a vital factor in metabolic protective functions,\nincluding the reduction of hydroperoxides, the quenching of free\nradicals, and the detoxi\ufb01cation of xenobiotics (1, 2). Glutathione\nsynthesis from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine is tightly regulated,with its determinants including the activity of c-glutamylcysteine\nsynthetase and the intracellular availability of cysteine (2, 3).\nCysteine can be synthesized from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. Both enzymes of the transsulfuration\npathway\u2014cystathionine b-synthase and cystathionine c-lyase\u2014\nrequire vitamin B-6 in the form of pyridoxal-5 #-phosphate\n(PLP) as coenzyme. PLP also serves as a coenzyme in the for-mation of glycine from serine through serine hydroxymethyl-\ntransferase.\nMarginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency, de\ufb01ned as a plasma PLP\nconcentration between 20 and 30 nmol/L (4), occurs frequently\n(5) and is associated with coronary artery disease (6\u20138), stroke\n(9), and an elevated risk of Alzheimer disease (10). Themechanisms responsible for linkages between vitamin B-6 status\nand chronic disease have not yet been established.\nA previous study from this laboratory showed that hepatic\nglutathione was inversely related to the dietary pyridoxine\nconcentration over a range from fully adequate (2 mg/kg diet)\nthrough moderate (0.5 mg/kg diet) and pronounced de\ufb01ciency(0.1 mg/kg) in rats (11). Plasma glutathione increased signi\ufb01-cantly during dietary vitamin B-6 restriction in healthy young\nmen and women (12). The mechanism by which reduced vitamin\nB-6 status affects mammalian glutathione metabolism remainsunclear. One may speculate that increases in tissue or blood\nglutathione might be induced by an in\ufb02ammatory state (13) and\noxidative stress (14\u201316) related to vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency. Ox-idative conditions potentially promote transsulfuration \ufb02ux by\nactivating cystathionine b-synthase (17, 18) and glutathione\nsynthesis via activation of c-glutamylcysteine ligase and gluta-\nthione synthetase (18). On the basis of the observations of our\nprevious protocols and the reported connection between vitamin\nB-6 de\ufb01ciency and oxidative stress, we hypothesize that gluta-thione synthesis increases after vitamin B-6 restriction in hu-mans despite the essential role of PLP in the production of\nglutathione precursors.\n1From the Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, Institute of\nFood and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (YL\nand JFG); the Department of Chemistry, University of Vermont, Burlington,VT (BO and DEM); the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, De-\npartment of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (LRG, CK, and\nPWS); and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Collegeof Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (PWS).\n2Supported by NIH grant DK072398 and General Clinical Research Cen-\nter grant M01-RR00082.\n3Address correspondence to JF Gregory, Food Science and Human\nNutrition Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-0370.E-mail: jfgy@u\ufb02.edu.\nReceived March 9, 2009.

Printed in USA. /C2112009 American Society for Nutrition\nRed blood cell (RBC) glutathione synthesis rates have been\ndetermined in humans with the use of stable-isotope-labeled\nglutathione precursors, such as glycine (19\u201323) or cysteine (24\u201327). RBCs are a major source of glutathione (28). As previously\nreported (29), we designed a steady state stable-isotope tracer\ninfusion protocol to assess the effect of marginal vitamin B-6de\ufb01ciency on whole-body glycine kinetics in healthy men and\nwomen. This protocol used [1,2-\n13C2]glycine before and after\ndietary vitamin B-6 restriction. Our aim was to quantify thefractional synthesis rate (FSR) and the absolute synthesis rate\n(ASR) of RBC glutathione and to determine their dependence on\nvitamin B-6 status in vivo. We also report plasma and RBCconcentrations of glutathione and related amino acids before andafter dietary vitamin B-6 restriction in this group of 13 healthy\nmen and women.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nSubjects\nVolunteers underwent a physical examination and were\nscreened by standard clinical measures of hematological, hepatic,\nrenal, and thyroid function. Medical history, dietary habits, anddemographic data were assessed by a questionnaire. Of 37\nrecruited healthy male and nonpregnant female volunteers, 23\nmet the following inclusion criteria: age between 20\u201340 y, nohistory of gastrointestinal surgery, abnormal kidney or thyroidfunction, or any other chronic disease; no smoking or chronic\ndrug use or alcoholism; no vitamin, amino acid, or protein\nsupplementation; no chronic consumption of a high-protein diet;and a body mass index (in kg/m\n2),28. All selected subjects\nwere in adequate nutritional status for serum folate ( .7 nmol/\nL), serum vitamin B-12 ( .200 pmol/L), plasma PLP ( .30\nnmol/L), and plasma total homocysteine ( ,12lmol/L).\nBefore the study, 6 of the 23 subjects that passed screening\nwithdrew because of personal reasons or scheduling problems.Three subjects were withdrawn during intervention because ofchanges in health status and one withdrew for personal reasons.\nAll subjects gave written informed consent. The University of\nFlorida Institutional Review Board and the General ClinicalResearch Center (GCRC) Scienti\ufb01c Advisory Committee\nreviewed and approved this protocol.\nDietary treatment\nAll meals were prepared by the Bionutrition Unit of the\nGCRC. The subjects consumed nutritionally adequate meals witha standardized composition for 2 d to minimize dietary variation\nimmediately before the \ufb01rst infusion. Subjects began consuming\na vitamin B-6\u2013restricted diet (0.32\u20130.38 mg vitamin B-6/d) onthe day after the \ufb01rst infusion and continued this regimen for 28\nconsecutive days (29\u201331). During this period, the subjects\nconsumed breakfast at the GCRC, were given a take-out lunchand snack to eat at their convenience, and returned to the GCRCto consume their evening meal. We compensated for any vitamin\nand mineral inadequacies of the study diets (other than vitamin\nB-6) by administering custom supplements daily to the subjects.Compliance with the dietary regimen was monitored by weekly\nmeasurements of plasma PLP as described below. After the\nsecond infusion day, an over-the-co unter multivitamin-multimineralsupplement was provided to the subjects to facilitate restoration\nof normal vitamin B-6 status.\nIsotope infusion protocol\nThe infusion protocol was previously described in detail\n(29, 32). [1,2-\n13C2]Glycine, L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine and sodium\n[13C]bicarbonate were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes\nLaboratories (Andover, MA). The parenteral solutions of thesecompounds were prepared in isotonic saline, \ufb01lter sterilized, andanalyzed to ensure the lack of pyrogenicity and microbial con-\ntamination.\nSubjects were admitted to the GCRC on the evening before the\ninfusion protocol and consumed no food or drinks, except water,\nbetween 2100 and the \ufb01rst blood draw. On the morning of the\ninfusion, a catheter was inserted in the antecubital vein of eacharm: one for the tracer infusion and one for blood collection.\nFasting blood samples were collected 2 h before infusion (at\n\u20190700) for the measurement of plasma PLP, serum folate,\nvitamin B-12, and plasma total homocysteine concentrations.Infusions were initiated at \u20190900 with a 5-min, \u201920 mL\npriming dose that delivered 9.26 lmol [1,2-\n13C2]glycine/kg,\n1.87 lmol [5,5,5-2H3]leucine/kg, and 2.15 lmol NaH13CO3/kg.\nThe 9-h constant infusion followed immediately thereafter at\na rate of \u201920 mL/h to provide 9.26 lmol [1,2-13C2]glycine/kg\nand 1.87 lmol [5,5,5-2H3]leucine/kg.\nBlood samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.5,\nand 9 h of the infusion. The samples were placed immediately on\nice and centrifuged within 15 min after the blood draw (1500 \u00b7g,\n4/C176C, 10 min). Plasma was stored in microcentrifuge tubes at\n280/C176C. After removal of the buffy coat, RBCs were washed\ntwice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), lysed in distilledwater in a 1:1 dilution, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at280/C176C until analyzed.\nThe subjects received a nutritive formula hourly starting 2 h\nbefore the infusion to maintain a fed state (33). This formulaprovided a balanced pattern of amino acids at a rate based on\nrequirements of 0.8 g protein /C1kg\n21/C1d21, which equals an\nhourly protein dose of \u20190.03 g/kg with 5.23 and 5.44 kJ /C1kg21/C1\nd21for women and men, respectively. The formula further\nprovided an adequate energy intake according to the require-\nments of 126 and 130 kJ /C1kg21/C1d21for women and men,\nrespectively.\nSample analyses\nScreening measurements\nSerum folate and vitamin B-12 were analyzed with the use of\na chemiluminescence-based assay (Elecsys; Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN). Plasma total homocysteine concentrations\nwere measured as the ammonium 7-\ufb02uorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate derivative by reversed-phase HPLC with\n\ufb02uorescence detection (34).\nPlasma and RBC concentrations of amino acids and PLP\nPlasma and RBC glutathione, cysteine, and cysteinyl-glycine\nconcentrations were measured as described for plasma totalhomocysteine screening by reversed-phase HPLC with \ufb02uores-\ncence detection (34). Plasma and RBC PLP concentrations were\nmeasured as the semicarbazone derivative by reversed-phaseVITAMIN B-6 DEPENDENCE ON GLUTATHIONE SYNTHESIS 337\nHPLC with \ufb02uorescence detection (35, 36). Hemoglobin from\nlysed RBCs was measured with the use of a commercial\nsprectrophotometric procedure (HemoCue Hb 201+; HemoCue\nAB, A \u00a8ngelholm, Sweden).\nGas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry determination of\namino acid isotopic enrichment and concentration\nRBC amino acids were isolated, derivatized, and analyzed\nby gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in elec-tron capture negative ionization mode as previously described(37). The relative abundance of speci\ufb01c ions was determined by\nselected-ion monitoring at the following m/zratios: glycine\n(293\u2013295) and leucine (349\u2013352). Isotopic enrichments areexpressed as molar ratios (mol% excess) of labeled to un-\nlabeled isotopomers after correction for the natural abundance\nof stable isotopes, essentially as performed by Storch et al(33).\nLiquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analysis of RBC\nglutathione isotopic enrichment\nWhole-blood glutathione was isolated and derivatized from\na modi\ufb01ed method developed by Guan et al (38). Aliquots of\nwhole blood (150 lL) were transferred to 1.5-mL conical mi-\ncrocentrifuge tubes, and the tubes were frozen at 280/C176C,\nthawed, and vortex mixed. This procedure was repeated 3 times\nto lyse the RBCs in the whole-blood aliquot. A 300- lL aliquot\nof 10 mmol/L Ellman\u2019s solution [39.6 mg 5,5 #-dithiobis-(2-\nnitrobenzoic acid); Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in 10 mL of\n100 mmol ammonium bicarbonate buffer solution/L, adjusted topH = 7.5] was added to each microcentrifuge vial; the vials werevortex mixed, allowed to sit at room temperature for 15 min, and\nvortex mixed again. A 150- lL aliquot of 200 g sulfosalicylic\nacid solution/L was added, and each microcentrifuge vial wasvortex mixed again. The vials were centrifuged (10,000 \u00b7g) for\n15 min, and the supernatant \ufb02uid was transferred to a second\nmicrocentrifuge vial and centrifuged again at (10,000 \u00b7g) for 15\nmin. The supernatant \ufb02uid of each vial was then carefully\ntransferred to 250- lL polypropylene autosampler vials and\nstored at 280/C176C until analyzed.\nThe derivatized glutathione samples were measured for\n13C\ntracer content by LC-MS by using a Thermo-Finnigan Surveyor\nLC coupled with a Thermo-Finnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ DecaXP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer, con\ufb01gured in positiveelectrospray ionization (ESI) mode. The ESI spray voltage was\nset at 4.5 kV; sheath gas (N\n2) was kept at a setting of 40, and the\ncapillary temperature was maintained at 225 /C176C. The LC column\nused was an Atlantis dC 18,1\u00b7150-mm, 3- lm bead column\n(Waters Corp, Milford, MA) kept at 40 /C176C. The LC was run\nisocratically at 87% water, 12.5% acetonitrile, and 0.5% glacialacetic acid. The total run time was 11 min, with a mobile phase\n\ufb02ow of 55 lL/min and a typical retention time for derivatized\nglutathione of \u20197 min. The LC ef\ufb02uent was diverted away from\nthe ESI source for the initial 3 min of each LC run to keep anyunreacted Ellman\u2019s solution and residual sulfosalicylic acid\nfrom entering the ESI-LC-MS source. All mass spectrometry\ndata were collected in \u201czoom scan\u201d mode at \u20191 scan/s covering\nthe isotopic envelope for the [M+H]\n+ion of the derivatized\nglutathione ( m/z= 504.5\u2013508.5) to maximize mass resolution\nbetween isotopomers. After data acquisition, the intensity ofeach mass was averaged for the glutathione peak by using the\nThermo-Finnigan Xcalibur Qual browser software. The peak\nareas for the [M+H]+ion for unlabeled glutathione ( m/z= 505)\nand [13C2]glutathione ( m/z= 507) were then exported to an\nExcel worksheet, and the area ratios were converted to enrich-\nment as mole% excess13C2-glutathione with the use of standard\nequations.\nKinetic principles and analysis\nAs reported previously (29, 32), the combined use of\n[1,2-13C2]glycine and [2H3]leucine permits determination of\nthe kinetics of whole-body glycine turnover, the conversionof glycine to serine, the rate of glycine decarboxylation, and\nits role as a source of 1-carbon units in 1-carbon metabolism.\n[\n2H3]Leucine was included to evaluate any nutritional effects on\nprotein turnover as indicated by leucine \ufb02ux (31, 39). The pla-\nteau enrichment (Ep) for all infused amino acid tracers was\ncalculated as the mean of the plasma isotopic enrichments forthe\u20191.5-h to 9-h time points for the infused [\n13C2]glycine and\n[2H3]leucine tracers. Steady state kinetics of amino acid tracers\nwere calculated by using standard equations (40) as described\nearlier (29, 32). The \ufb02ux of leucine ( QLeu) in the plasma pool\nwas calculated as\nQLeu\u00bcILeu3\u00bd\u00f0ELeu\u00de=\u00f0EpLeu\u00de21/C138\u00f0 1\u00de\nwhere ILeuis the [2H3]leucine infusion rate, ELeuis the enrich-\nment of the [2H3]leucine tracer, and Ep Leuis the plateau enrich-\nment of [2H3]leucine in plasma.\nGlycine \ufb02ux ( QGly) was calculated as\nQGly\u00bcIGly3/C2/C0\nEGly/C1\n=/C0\nEp#Gly/C1\n21/C3\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere IGlyis the [13C2]glycine infusion rate, EGlyis the enrich-\nment of the [13C2]glycine tracer, and Ep #Glyis the plateau en-\nrichment of plasma [13C2]glycine corrected for intracellular\noverestimation (41, 42).\nThe FSR represents the fraction of the total pool that is\nsynthesized per unit of time. The direct incorporation of theinfused [1,2-\n13C2]glycine tracer (glycine M+2) in glutathione\nsynthesis was determined and, thus, the synthesis of glutathione\nM+2. The FSR of RBC glutathione was approximated by using\nthe initial rate of glutathione M+2 enrichment (slope of lin-\near increase among the time points 4, 6, 7.5, and 9 h after in-\nfusion) and the estimated plateau enrichment of RBC glycine\n(Ep RBC glycine ).\nFSR glutathione \u00bcinitial rate of RBC glutathione M\n\u00fe2 enrichment =EpRBC glycine \u00f03\u00de\nThe RBC glycine enrichment at plateau (Ep RBC glycine ) was de-\ntermined by \ufb01tting enrichment data to single exponential curves\nde\ufb01ned by the equation\nE\u00bcEf\u00f012e2kt\u00de\u00f0 4\u00de\nwhere Eis the enrichment at time t(h),Efis the enrichment at\nin\ufb01nity (ie, plateau enrichment), and kis the rate constant (h21)\nfrom the \ufb01tted curve (43).

All data are pre-sented as means 6SEMs. A paired ttest was used to assess\ndifferences between normal vitamin B-6 status and marginal\nvitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency. Correlations between static and dynamicparameters of glutathione synthesis were determined with the\nuse of the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coef\ufb01cient. Linear re-\ngression was used to determine the in\ufb02uence of static and dy-namic variables on the rate of glutathione synthesis before and\nafter vitamin B-6 restriction and on the change in the ASR and\nFSR of RBC glutathione. Tertiles of RBC glutathione FSR wereevaluated by using one-factor ANOVA, with multiple compar-isons performed by using the Holm-Sidak method. Data were\nanalyzed by using Microsoft Of\ufb01ce Excel 2007 (Microsoft\nCorporation, Redmond, WA), SigmaStat 3.0, and SPSS 16.0(SPSS Inc, Rochester, MN).\nRESULTS\nDietary vitamin B-6 restriction signi\ufb01cantly reduced the\nplasma PLP concentration ( Table 1 )b y5 563%. All 13 subjects\nhad reached the range of plasma PLP associated with marginal\nvitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency after 22 62 d of consuming the vitamin\nB-6\u2013restricted diet. Concurrent with the decrease in plasma PLPconcentration, vitamin B-6 restriction signi\ufb01cantly reduced the\nRBC PLP concentration (Table 1) by 18 62%. Marginal vita-\nmin B-6 de\ufb01ciency did not alter the plasma and RBC concen-trations of glutathione, cysteine, and cysteinyl-glycine. As\nreported previously (29), these subjects showed no change in\nplasma serine, methionine, or total homocysteine concen-trations, whereas their plasma glycine and cystathionine con-\ncentrations signi\ufb01cantly increased because of vitamin B-6\nrestriction.\nThe progressive isotopic enrichment of RBC glutathione and\nits precursor RBC glycine in this protocol are presented in Figure\n1. The means for FSR and ASR of RBC glutathione ( Table 2 )\nwere slightly lower in marginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency; how-ever, this did not reach statistical signi\ufb01cance ( P= 0.10 and P=\n0.14, respectively). The individual FSR of RBC glutathione\nresponded to vitamin B-6 restriction, ranging from a 58% de-crease to a 45% increase ( Figure 2 A). The individual ASRs of\nRBC glutathione ranged from a 57% decrease to a 58% increase\n(Figure 2B). To further examine the heterogeneity of this re-sponse, we ranked FSR values according to the extent and di-\nrection of absolute change due to vitamin B-6 restriction and\ndivided them into tertiles ( Table 3 ). ASR and FSR of RBC\nglutathione at normal vitamin B-6 status signi\ufb01cantly correlatedwith the extent of change in ASR and FSR observed due to\nvitamin B-6 restriction, respectively (ASR: q=20.698, P,\n0.01; FSR: q=20.692, P,0.01). The change in RBC PLP\nconcentration in response to vitamin B-6 restriction was sig-\nni\ufb01cantly related to the change in RBC cysteine concentration\nTABLE 1\nConcentration of plasma and red blood cell (RBC) pyridoxal-5 #-phosphate\n(PLP), glutathione, total cysteine, and cysteinylglycine before and afterdietary vitamin B-6 restriction\n1\nAt normal\nvitamin\nB-6 statusAt marginal\nvitamin B-6\nde\ufb01ciency\nPlasma PLP (nmol/L) 55 642 3 612\nRBC PLP (pmol/g hemoglobin) 429 619 352 6142\nPlasma glutathione ( lmol/L) 6.9 61.9 6.7 61.1\nRBC glutathione\n(lmol/L packed red cells)2068650 2117 648\nPlasma total\ncysteine ( lmol/L)237633 237 629\nRBC total cysteine\n(nmol/g hemoglobin)14168 144 68\nPlasma cysteinylglycine\n(lmol/L)31.261.4 29.7 61.3\nRBC cysteinylglycine\n(nmol/g hemoglobin)193615 200 618\n1All values are means 6SEMs; n= 13.\n2Signi\ufb01cantly different from normal vitamin B-6 status, P,0.0001\n(paired ttest).\nFIGURE 1.

Linear regression showed that the\nchange in ASR and FSR of RBC glutathione in response tovitamin B-6 restriction were both negatively dependent on the\nFSR at normal vitamin B-6 status ( Figure 3 ).\nDISCUSSION\nVitamin B-6 depletion and marginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency\nhave been shown to increase glutathione concentrations in ratliver (11, 44) and human plasma (12). To our knowledge, this was\nthe \ufb01rst study to investigate the effect of vitamin B-6 status on in\nvivo glutathione synthesis in healthy men and women. Weshowed that marginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency tended to decrease\nRBC glutathione synthesis rates without affecting the plasma and\nRBC total glutathione concentration. The response of RBCglutathione synthesis rate to vitamin B-6 restriction varied greatly\namong subjects and was shown to depend on the initial FSR value\n(Figure 3). Changes in RBC glutathione synthesis rates were notpredicted by the concentration or extent of change in plasma and\nRBC cysteine and glutathione.

This \ufb01nding is consistent with recent results of math-ematical modeling simulations that predicted the effect of mild\nvitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency on blood glutathione concentration to be\nsolely related to increased oxidative stress and not to the reducedvelocity of PLP-dependent enzymes involved in cysteine for-\nmation (45). The variability in responses among subjects might\nresult from factors in\ufb02uencing the activity and expression ofc-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase, eg antioxidants and hormones\nsuch as insulin and glucocorticoids (1). Because de\ufb01ciencies of\nc-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase and glutathione synthetase occur\nvery rarely and are related to severe clinical symptoms (46), wedo not believe that the observed variation in the basal rate of\nglutathione synthesis was associated with genetic variation.\nFurthermore, we were unable to postulate a mechanism by whichcellular PLP depletion would directly alter glutathione synthesis.\nDespite the fact that marginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency yielded\nsubstantial and individually varied glutathione synthesisresponses, plasma and RBC glutathione concentrations remained\nconstant in our subjects. Similar \ufb01ndings were reported by Lyons\net al (26), who observed reduced whole-blood glutathione syn-thesis rates but unaltered whole-blood glutathione concentrationsafter a 10-d sulfur amino acid\u2013free diet in healthy men. In ad-\ndition, mathematical modeling predicted constant blood gluta-\nthione concentrations during increasing oxidative stress anddecreasing cytoplasmic (largely hepatic) glutathione concen-\ntrations (45). A possible explanation for this observation is\na reduced glutathione turnover (26), potentially caused by re-duced glutathione transport (47). In rat heart and liver tissues,\na more severe vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency induced an increase in\nglutathione peroxidase activity and to a lesser extent in gluta-thione reductase activity (15). This shift in enzyme activity\nevoked a decrease in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione,\nwhereas glutathione concentrations remained unaltered (15).Although our results indicate that the effects of marginal vitaminB-6 de\ufb01ciency on glutathione synthesis are independent of the\ncysteine supply, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the\nvariation in response in glutathione synthesis with concurrentlyconstant RBC glutathione concentration remain to be de-\ntermined.\nCysteine formation through the transsulfuration pathway is an\nimportant source of cysteine for glutathione synthesis. The de-\npendence of glutathione synthesis on cystathionine b-synthase\nwas shown in an in vitro model in which the glutathione con-centration decreased by half within 17.5 min after inactivation of\ncystathionine b-synthase (48). As shown in this study and pre-\nviously (12), marginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency did not alterplasma or RBC cysteine concentrations. Furthermore, the he-patic cysteine concentration was maintained in rats with mod-\nerate levels of de\ufb01ciency (11). In vivo cysteine \ufb02ux is\nmaintained in human vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency states (12). Like-wise, this research group has shown that the in vitro activity of\nhepatic cystathionine c-lyase is depressed even in rats with mild\nvitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency (11), but the hepatic cysteine concen-tration in rats is approximately constant over a wide range of\nmoderate vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency states (11). We previously\nproposed that elevated cystathionine, under conditions in whichcystathionine is lower than the Michaelis constant for cys-tathionine c-lyase, compensates at least partially for the re-duction in cystathionine c-lyase caused by PLP depletion (11,\n12) to allow transsulfuration \ufb02ux to be maintained in marginal\nvitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency. We suggest that cysteine formationthrough transsulfuration is resilient to marginal vitamin B-6\nde\ufb01ciency and, thus, cysteine production does not limit gluta-\nthione synthesis at this level of de\ufb01ciency. This situation differsfrom more severe vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency that is capable of re-\nducing cysteine availability to the extent glutathione synthesis is\nimpaired and glutathione concentration is reduced (49).\nMethionine and cysteine contribute equally to glutathione\nsynthesis as shown in rat hepatocytes (50). At an adequate intake\nof methionine, the dietary cysteine supply did not alter the RBCglutathione synthesis rate in healthy adults (51). A diet free ofmethionine and cysteine signi\ufb01cantly reduced the whole-blood\nglutathione synthesis rate, whereas it did not affect the whole-\nblood glutathione concentration (26). In our study, the subjectsconsumed an adequate supply of protein (73 64 g/d) and of\nmethionine and cystine (1.7 60.1 and 1.3 60.1 mg/d) during\nthe 28-d vitamin B-6\u2013restricted diet. Cysteine in plasma \ufb02uc-tuates depending on protein and glutathione breakdown in tis-\nsues (3). Glutathione breakdown has been shown to account for\n50% of cysteine \ufb02ux (24). A 30% decrease in the plasma cys-teine concentration after a 10-d sulfur amino acid\u2013free diet (26)could be explained primarily by reduced protein breakdown. In\nour study, marginal vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency did not change\nwhole-body protein turnover as indicated by constant whole-body leucine \ufb02ux. The observed variation in effects of vitamin\nB-6 restriction on the glutathione synthesis rate was, therefore,\nunrelated to changes in protein turnover or sulfur amino acidintake.\nRBC glutathione has widely been used in the quanti\ufb01cation of\nin vivo glutathione synthesis rate (19\u201322). In rabbits (52) and pigs(53), faster glutathione synthesis was determined in liver than in\nblood cells. Compared with control rats without infection, septic\nrats had lower glutathione synthesis rates in whole blood buthigher rates in liver, spleen, large intestine, lung, muscle, andheart (54). This observation would explain our \ufb01ndings of slightly\nreduced mean RBC glutathione synthesis in the present study and\nan elevated liver glutathione concentration in vitamin B-6\u2013de\ufb01cient rats in our previous report (11). Also, Hsu et al (44)\nfound increased glutathione synthesis rates in vitamin B-6\u2013\ndepleted rat liver and only mildly increased RBC glutathioneconcentrations. In addition, it should be recognized that the\neffects of vitamin B-6 restriction on RBC glutathione synthesis\nwould result from reduced PLP in the liver and other tissuescapable of 1-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration. The rat\nliver PLP concentration decreased proportionally to the dietary\npyridoxine concentration, which indicated that the dietary vita-min B-6 supply affects the vitamin B-6 concentration and,therefore, the coenzyme function at the tissue level (11). Whereas\nthe reductions in plasma and RBC PLP re\ufb02ect the dietary vitamin\nB-6 intake, it should not be assumed that the \ufb02uxes of such PLP-dependent processes would be equally affected at various extents\nof vitamin B-6 de\ufb01ciency.\nIn conclusion, we showed with this human tracer study, a rat\nmodel (11), and a mathematical model (45) that vitamin B-6\nstatus has an effect on glutathione metabolism that varies from\nperson to person. Our results also indicate that variations in theRBC glutathione synthesis rates and in glutathione concentrationsdo not occur as a result of an impaired supply of the precursorVITAMIN B-6 DEPENDENCE ON GLUTATHIONE SYNTHESIS 341\namino acid cysteine.
