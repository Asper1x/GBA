In this context, we hypothesize d that serum\nvitamin K levels are associated with MSD in preschool children, and the widely\nusedvitaminA andvitaminDsupplementsmaymediatethese ass ociationsbased\non potential mechanisms, which expects to provide guidance for fut ure practice.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Sichuan province in\nsouthwestern China, from January /two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/one.tnum to May /two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum. Serum levels of vitamin\nK/one.tnum/K/two.tnum and /two.tnum/five.tnum(OH)D were determined using the high-performance l iquid\nchromatography method, and the diagnosis of MSD was executed by cli nicians.\nOverall and strati\ufb01ed logistic regression analysis based on categorized /two.tnum/five.tnum(OH)D\nlevels were conducted to assess association between serum vitamin K levels and\nMSD prevalence after adjusting for confounders. Mediation analy sis was further\nperformed and vitamin A and D supplementation was regressed as t he mediator.\nResults: A total of /six.tnum,/three.tnum/six.tnum/eight.tnum children aged /zero.tnum\u2013/six.tnum years old were enrolled. MSD was\nidenti\ufb01ed in /one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum (/one.tnum/eight.tnum./five.tnum/one.tnum%) of the children, while /five.tnum,/one.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum (/eight.tnum/one.tnum./four.tnum/nine.tnum %) of them did not\npresent such disorder. After adjusting confounders, a signi\ufb01 cant di\ufb00erence was\nfound in serum vitamin K/one.tnum level between children in MSD and Non-MSD group\n(OR=/zero.tnum./eight.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum, /nine.tnum/five.tnum% CI/zero.tnum./seven.tnum/four.tnum/five.tnum\u2013/zero.tnum./eight.tnum/six.tnum/four.tnum). No signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence was found in serum\nvitamin K/two.tnum level between the two groups ( OR=/zero.tnum./nine.tnum/seven.tnum/five.tnum, /nine.tnum/five.tnum% CI/zero.tnum./seven.tnum/five.tnum/three.tnum\u2013/one.tnum./two.tnum/six.tnum/one.tnum). The\nassociation between vitamin K/one.tnum level and MSD prevalence was partly (/three.tnum /six.tnum./eight.tnum%)\nmediated by vitamin A and D supplementation.\nConclusions: A low serum vitamin K/one.tnum level is connected with an increased risk\nof MSD among children, highlighting that vitamin A and D supplem entation is a\nhelpful intervention to prevent MSD in children with vitamin K de \ufb01ciency.\nKEYWORDS\npreschool children, serum vitamin K levels, musculoskeletal d isorders, a cross-sectional\nstudy,vitaminAandvitaminDsupplement\nFrontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org\nGe et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum\nBackground\nMusculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are conditions that can\na\ufb00ect the muscles, bones, and joints, which are also the largest\nsource of global rehabilitation need, ranking \ufb01fth in disability-\nadjusted life years (DALYs) and \ufb01rst in years lived with disability\n(YLDs) ( 1,2). Childhood, an active stage of bone mineral\naccumulation and critical for adult peak bone mass ( 3,4), is a\nparticularly susceptible window for prevention and treatment of\nMSDs (5). MSDs in childhood, such as rickets, can lead to bone\ndeformities and di\ufb03culties with activities, which impact health\nsubstantially,growthanddevelopmentofchildrenandadolescents\n(6,7). Poor treatment of musculoskeletal problems can have a\nnegative in\ufb02uence on the quality of life and lead to short-term\nconsequenceslikefractures,orlong-termoneslikeosteoporosis( 8\u2013\n12). This implies that MSDs in children should be given special\nattention due to their higher potential for skeleton healing and\nremodeling( 5).\nAge is not the sole factor in\ufb02uencing MSDs, as MSDs have\nbeen widely reported to be closely associated with nutrient\nintake: studies have shown that vitamin C can foster trabecular\nbone formation by modulating bone matrix gene expression ( 13,\n14), while vitamin D and its metabolites contribute to bone\ndevelopment by a\ufb00ecting intestinal calcium transport and serum\ncalciumandphosphatehomeostasis( 15,16).Furthermore,vitamin\nA appears to a\ufb00ect bone health by simulating osteoblastic activity\nand bone formation, as well as inhibiting osteoclastic activity\nand bone resorption ( 17). It also correlates with the availability\nof vitamin D receptor binding vitamin D ( 18). Recent studies\nalso suggest that vitamin K de\ufb01ciency may serve as a predictor\nof MSDs by reducing the carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent\nproteins,suchasosteocalcinandmatrixGlaprotein,whichregulate\nthe calci\ufb01cation ( 19\u201322), thereby paving the way for etiological\ninvestigationsandinterventions.\nSome studies to date have examined the relationship between\nvitamin K and adult bone health, yielding some negative\ncorrelations between serum vitamin K levels and MSDs ( 23,\n24). However, the study on vitamin K levels and its association\nwith MSDs in children remains limited, particularly in preschool\nchildren who are experiencing active bone mineral accumulation.\nVitamin K de\ufb01ciency is one of the most common malnutrition\nissuesinChinesechildren( 25).Therefore,itisurgenttoexplorethe\nassociation between serum vitamin K levels in preschool children\nand their MSDs. In addition, due to the potential side e\ufb00ects\nof vitamin K ( 26), there is insu\ufb03cient evidence to recommend\nvitaminKsupplementationforchildren.However,somealternative\ninterventions can be taken to reduce the adverse e\ufb00ects of vitamin\nK de\ufb01ciency. For instance, vitamin A (Vit A) and vitamin D\n(Vit D) are easily accessible, safe, and widely prescribed in China\n(27\u201329), acting synergistically in bone metabolism with vitamin\nK. Extrapolating from general population studies ( 30,31), it\nis plausible that Vit A and Vit D supplementation in MSD\npatients could serve as a potential therapeutic target to enhance\nbonehealth.\nThis study aimed to assess 1) the association of two\nmajor subtypes of vitamin K [phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and\nmenaquinone(vitaminK2)]inalargeChinesesampleofpreschool\nchildren with MSD and 2) the mediation e\ufb00ect of Vitamin A/Dsupplement in the association between Vitamin K1/K2 levels and\nMSDsinpreschoolchildren.\nMethods\nParticipants and data collection sample\nsources\nThestudyenrolledchildrenaged0\u20136yearsoldwhounderwent\nhealth assessments at outpatient clinics of the child health\ndepartments across 10 urban areas ( 32) comprising 18 maternal\nand child health hospitals in Sichuan Province ( Figure1) from\nJanuary 2021 to May 2022.

Based\non this study, vitamin A and D supplementation is an e\ufb00ective\nand feasible measure for children to partially block skeletal muscle\ndiseasecausedbyvitaminKde\ufb01ciency.\nThough the mechanisms linking nutrients de\ufb01ciencies and\nbone metabolism are not fully understood, previous studies\nshow that vitamin K may in\ufb02uence bone transformation through\nvarious pathways, including osteoblast di\ufb00erentiation, osteoclast\ninhibition,andactivationofbone-associatedvitaminK-dependent\nproteins, such as osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein that play\nessential roles in the mineralization of extracellular bone matrix\n(43,53,54). During this process, bone mineralization ( 55) is\nFrontiersin Nutrition /zero.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org\nGe et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnut./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum\nalso closely related to the serum calcium levels, which can be\nregulated by vitamin D ( 56\u201358). This is consistent with our\n\ufb01ndings. It could be due to excessively low levels of vitamin D,\nincomplete decarboxylation of osteocalcin cannot occur which\nleads to inhibited bone mineralization, further manifesting as\nthe lack of correlation between level of vitamin K and MSD\noccurrence.Besides,vitaminAalsoappearstoa\ufb00ectbonehealthby\nsimulating osteoblastic activity and inhibiting osteoclastic activity\n(18). Just as vitamin A and vitamin D are often used together\nin clinical practice, evidence shows that their pathways may\noverlap (59). Based on the above knowledge, we can speculate that\nsupplementation with vitamin A or vitamin D or a combination\nmay be a potential mediator to mitigate the adverse e\ufb00ects\nof vitamin K de\ufb01ciency on MSDs, which is consistent with\nourstudy.\nOur \ufb01ndings provide several implications for future research\nfuture research and practice. More attention should be paid\nto vitamin K de\ufb01ciency in children, and vitamin A and D\nsupplementationmayhelpmitigatetheadversee\ufb00ectsofvitaminK\nde\ufb01ciencyonMSDs.What\u2019smore,largeprospectivecohortsshould\nexaminetheshort-andlong-terme\ufb00ectsofvitaminKlevelonbone\nhealth in children. Ethically feasible clinical trials with safe doses\ncanbeconductedtoprovidefurtherinsights.\nThere are some strengths in this study. Firstly, we used\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for vitamin K\nlevels determination of participant from multiple regions with\nguaranteed consistency of measurement methods and a high\ndetection sensitivity. Secondly, diagnosis of MSD was con\ufb01rmed\nthrough physicians at the Sichuan Maternal and Child Health\nHospital. The recollection bias and reporting bias has been\ncontrolled. This study is also restrained by several limitations.\nFirstly, the present study is a cross-sectional study that can merely\nshow the correlation instead of causality. Secondly, despite careful\nadjustment for a extent range of covariates in the model, residual\nconfoundingduetotheunavailabilityofdatamayexist.Thirdly,we\nonly detected serum level of menaquinone-4, one of the subtypes\nof vitamin K2, which may underestimate level of exposure. Lastly,\nour study is conducted in a regional population with speci\ufb01c\nage group. We recommend exercising caution when extrapolating\nthe \ufb01ndings of this study to children in other regions and\nagegroups.\nConclusions\nThis study found that the serum vitamin K1 levels was\nsigni\ufb01cantly associated with MSDs, while the serum vitamin\nK2 levels were not. It also illustrated that vitamin AD\nsupplementation may potentially in\ufb02uence these associations.\nThese \ufb01ndings underscore the public health signi\ufb01cance of\nvitamin A and D supplementation as a bene\ufb01cial intervention\nfor preventing MSDs attributable to vitamin K1 de\ufb01ciency\ninchildren.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmadeavailablebytheauthors,withoutunduereservation.Ethics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by Ethics\nCommittee of Sichuan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care\nHospital(2019,No.20).Thestudieswereconductedinaccordance\nwith the local legislation and institutional requirements.
