{"prompt": "Vitamin B and Peptic Ulcer", "completion": "VITAMIN B AND PEPTIC ULCER \nBy M. NAIIASIMHA RAO, m.b., b.s. \nResearch Fellow, Andhra University \n(From the Department of Biochemistry, Medical \nCollege, Vizagapatam) \nDiet, as a contributory factor in the aetiology \nof peptic ulcer, was known to the early pathol- \nogists. In recent years the subject has been \nelaborated and various aspects of diet brought \nto light, and held to be responsible causative \nagents. Some of them were: 'carried' foods, \ncoarse foods, ' hot' foods, foods at high tem- \nperatures, marked difference in the temperature \nof various dishes; irregular meals, meals at long \nintervals, etc. That diet probably is partly \nresponsible for the frequency of peptic ulcer in \nIndia has been pointed out by McCarrison, \nBradfield and Somervell. And the various ways \nin which the diet was accused were : increased \ncarbohydrate content of the food; markedly low \nfat diet; gross deficiency of vitamins A, B \nand C. \nNow that laboratory methods have been \ndeveloped for assaying the various constituents \nof the food, an investigation into the diet as to \nits quality and deficiency can be conducted \nmore rationally. \nIt has been observed by the writer that the \ndiet of the labourer, the common victim of \npeptic ulcer in South India, is lacking in the \nessential vitamins A and B, in addition to \nvariations in the proximate principles. The \npresent investigation has been attempted for \nthe purpose of studying the amount of vitamin- \nB deficiency by microchemical techniques, in \npatients with peptic ulcer. \nTowards the biochemistry of avitaminosis B, \ncontributions have been largely made by the \nOxford school of workers. The following may \nbe noted as their essential conclusions. In the \nbrains of experimental polyneuritic pigeons it \nhas been found that there was increased quan- \ntity of lactic acid and diminished tissue respira- \ntion in glucose or lactate solutions, when com- \npared with healthy controls. It has also been \nshown beyond doubt that diminished oxygen \nintake was entirely due to lack of vitamin B in \nthe tissue (Peters, 1936). Hence they con- \ncluded that vitamin B was needed for the \noxidative removal of lactic acid. Thus the fact \nwas scientifically established that vitamin B \nwas specially concerned with carbohydrate \nmetabolism. Peters and Thompson (1934) have \nstudied the metabolism of pyruvate in vitro and \ncame to the conclusion that pyruvic acid, as an \nintermediary metabolite, was inversely propor- \ntional to the vitamin content of the brain. This \nobservation on the brain was applied to other \ntissues of the body, especially the blood; and \nit was found that blood has increased inter- \nmediate carbohydrate metabolites, especially \npyruvic acid which is formed in brain (Thomp- \nson and Johnson 1935). Other intermediate \ncarbohydrate metabolites also have been found \n458 THE INDIAN MEDICAL GAZETTE [Aug., 1938 \nin the blood of avitaminous birds?especially \nmethyl glyoxal?as shown by Geiger and Rosen- \nberg (1933), but this could not be corroborated \nby Gavrilescu and Peters (1931) and Johnson \n(1936). Johnson and others (1935) attempted \nto correlate the above facts for the purpose of \nassessing the vitamin deficiency of an individual \nby estimating the pyruvic acid in blood. They \nestablished the level in normal patients but could \nfind no person with B deficiency in England for \ninvestigation. But in China, Piatt and Lu \n(1935) published their observations of the \npresence of pyruvic acid in the blood of beriberi \npatients. Subsequently they (1936) confirmed \nbeyond doubt that the same can be applied as a \nfairly accurate laboratory test for the avita- \nminosis B. \nMany methods have been advocated for \nestimating the pyruvate in blood. A qualitative \none can be used?a modified Rothera's test with \nnitroprusside and strong ammonia?a blue-green \ncolour indicates the presence of pyruvic acid. \nOther tests are those of Simon and Piaux's, and \nPosternak's quoted by Case. Quantitatively \nvarious methods of estimation are available. \n1. MacLean's method. Precipitation of \npyruvic acid with phenyl hydrazine and sub- \nsequent estimation of unchanged hydrazine. \n2. Clift and Cook's method (1932) is based \non the capacity of binding bisulphite. \nEach method has its own advantages and dis- \nadvantages according to the medium in which \nthe pyruvic acid is contained; namely, muscle \nfiltrate, blood or cerebrospinal fluid. \nThe two methods used in the present investiga- \ntion are modified MacLean's and Cook's. The \ndisadvantage of the first method is in the proper \nextraction of the hydrazone of the pyruvic acid \nfrom the blood, the advantage being that pyruvic \nacid can be estimated as such. Whereas, in the \nsecond method the advantage is the amount of \naccuracy obtained, with the disadvantage that \nthe pyruvic acid is estimated as an unknown \nquantity of the bisulphite-binding substances in \nthe blood; the proportions of the remaining \nvariable moieties being also unknown. But with \nthe idea of having a clearer reading of the results \nby a harmonious combination of both the \nmethods it was attempted to use both the \nmethods together and the attempt was only \npartly successful. \nPyruvic acid.?The estimations were done by \nCase's method (1932). Peter's and Thompson's \nmodification (1934) was also tried but was \nfound to be less efficient, due to the following \nreasons :? \n1. Large quantities of ethyl acetate have to \nbe used. \n2. The extractions are greater in number and \nnot quite satisfactory and demarcative. \n3. Greater time is required. \nCase's method involves the following \nprinciple :? \nExcess of 2:4 dinitrophenyl hydrazine is \nadded to the deproteinized extract of the blood (the blood being taken under basal conditions)- \nPyruvic acid hydrazone along with other hyd1'^' \nzones is formed in the solution and with tn \nuncombined hydrazine are extracted wl ! \nethyl acetate. Neutralization of the acids use \nfor deproteinization is done to prevent the sut>' \nsequent extraction of liydrazones other than tha \nof pyruvic acid. Neutralization of the ethy \nacetate extract instead of the preliminary ^VK \nchloracetic acid extract is done to facilitate rap1 \ninstead of repeated extractions with ethyl ace- \ntate. The combined liydrazones are evaporate \nand extracted with toluene, which gives them up \nmore readily than ethyl acetate. The pyruV.lC \nacid moiety is extracted from the others }n \ntoluene with cold sodium carbonate, which dis- \nsolves only the pyruvic acid hydrazone in tn? \ncold. The 2 : 4 dinitrophenyl hydrazone 0 \npyruvic acid is extracted from the carbonate \nafter acidification with ethyl acetate and crys- \ntallized. The estimate is done by the color1' \nmetric method against a standard 2 : 4 dinitro- \nphenyl hydrazone of pyruvic acid, the solven \nbeing alcoholic potash which gives a deep re \ncolour. \nExperimental details.?The patient is not pennit|-e^ to take any solid or liquid food subsequent to \nprevious night's dinner.

After separation the aqueous lay6 ' \nwhich is nearly colourless, is extracted with a furtfl6 \n10 c.cm. of ethyl acetate. As soon as the aqueous lay^g is colourless, which is usual after three extractions, it \ndiscarded.

The only \nrecord that could be found is that of Piatt and \nLu (1936). They have recorded the readings of \n23 healthy Chinese college students whose values \nvaried from 2.22 to 4.82 mgm. bisulphite-bind- \ning substances per 100 gm. of blood with an \naverage of 3.27 mgm. An attempt has been \nmade to find the bisulphite-binding substances values in healthy labour classes, as the majority \nof the 30 cases studied is from the same classes. \nTable III \nSerial \nnumber \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 Values of \nbisulphite- \nbinding \nsubstances \n4.7 \n3.1 \n2.7* \n5.2* \n3.3 \n3.1 \n6.353 \n4.580 \n3.228 \n3.906 \n1.704 \n3.354 \n1.457 \n* These cases could not be studied under basal \nconditions. \nThus it is seen that considering the 11 cases \ndone under ideal conditions the bisulphite-bind- \ning substances values vary from 1.457 to a \nmaximum of 6.353, the average being 3.457 \nmgm. Piatt and Lu report the content of the \nblood in established beriberi cases to be marked- \nly increased. But in none of the cases have \nthey reported values higher than 10 mgm. per \ncent. But in this connection it must be men- \ntioned that some of the ' gastric ' \ncases showed \nvalues higher than 10. An attempt has been \nmade to find the corresponding values of beri- \nberi cases admitted to the hospital. Seven cases \nshowing marked avitaminosis B were studied \nand the values are noted hereunder (table IV)- \nTable IV \nSerial \nnumber Values \n9.4 \n7.7 \n7.7 \n4.3 \n6.7 \n15.08 \n4.91 \nIt is interesting to note that one of the cases \n(6) has shown a value of above 15, and others, \nexcept case 4, show uniformly high values. \nOf the bisulphite-binding substances content \nof ' peptic ulcer' patients excluding cases 7 and \n12, where there was much unavoidable experi- \nmental error, the variation is from 2.1 to a \nmaximum of 23.73. \nFixing the maximum in a normal individual \nas 4.8, as judged from the healthy students, nine \nof the values are within the normal range and \nthe remaining ones beyond it; so much so that \nit appears that higher bisulphite-binding \nsubstances values are fairly frequent in \nAug., 1938] TREATMENT OF PHRYNODERMA : RADHAKRISHNA RAO 461 \nthese patients. But this observation is \nn?t without possibilities of error, the chief \n. which is the presumption that the pyruvic \n*cid nioiety of the bisulphite-binding sub- \nstances always bears the same high percent- \nage to the \"total. But from the readings in \niable II it appears it is not quite true. The \nnervations on this aspect are so meagre that \nle discussion on the subject cannot be complete, \nut frorn ^-jie pr00f advanced so far by Piatt \nnci Lu (1836) that bisulphite-binding sub- \n- ances values run parallel to the vitamin-B \n^ ciency it may be concluded with a fair \n' of certainty that these patients are \ntr ,?rinS from partial avitaminosis B. The \nbv+v ^le statement may be substantiated \nWc ?, that it is in these lower classes that \niiberi is fairly common. \n, lle discussion of the subject on the basis of \nmpS+ findinSs and findings of animal experi- \nn will be given in another paper. \nSummary \npe^,isuiphite-binding substances in blood of \n^ P Jc ulcer patients are found to be increased \ndefi1 8?od percentage of cases, showing a definite \nciency of vitamin B in these patients. \nAcknowledgments \nj ^-ake this opportunity of thanking Major \nlne .? \"r.
