Several experimental and \nclinical trials were conducted in order to navigate scientific evidence for the effect of these two herbs on body \nweight and appetite. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analysis support the weight-lowering effect of these \ntwo natural products.1,2 However, solid evidence for the mechanism of this effect was not sufficiently investigated. \nTherefore, we aimed in our study to investigate the mechanism of the weight-lowering and/or appetite suppressant \neffects of these two herbs.3 Accordingly, we opted to choose an in vivo study with normal biological system to \nallow us to identify the response of multiple hormones and peptides involved in the appetite control which act as \nexcitatory or inhibitory signals to the neurons of hunger and satiety centres of the hypothalamus.\nOn the other hand, this study was designed based on an observation found in our previous work. We previously studied the \neffect of two months' administration of Nigella sativa on the heart structure and electrophysiology, and unintentionally we \nobserved a reduction of body weight of all treated rats.4,5 The rats used for that study were normal healthy with body weight \n250\u2013350 g. Therefore, we planned to reproduce the weight reduction effect using the same experimental animal as well as the \nsame dose, preparation and duration of Nigella sativa and explore its physiological mechanisms. Simultaneously, we were keen \nto adhere to the guiding principles of the 3Rs (Replace, Reduce, and Refinement). Thus, we elected to go with the minimum \nnumber of animals in each group taking into consideration the risk of missing few animals during the course of the study.\nDespite all, we appreciate the recommendations of the authors of the Letter to Editor in regard to the utilization of \nobese animals and we will consider it in our future work.\nDisclosure\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this communication.\nVascular Health and Risk Management 2023:19 753\u2013754                                                    753\n\u00a9 2023 Al Asoom et al.
