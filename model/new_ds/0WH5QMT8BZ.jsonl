Vitamin E is an antioxidant with potential anti-  fibroblastic \neffect. The aim of this study was to establish an arthrofibrosis rat model after joint \nreplacement and assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on joint fibrosis.\nMethods: We simulated knee replacement in 16 male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. We \nimmobilized the surgical leg with a suture in full flexion. The control groups were \nkilled at 2 and 12\u2009weeks ( n\u2009=\u20095 per group), and the test group was supplemented \ndaily with vitamin E (0.2\u2009mg/mL) in their drinking water for 12\u2009weeks ( n\u2009=\u20096). We per -\nformed histological staining to investigate the presence and severity of arthrofibrosis. \nImmunofluorescent staining and \u03b12- macroglobulin ( \u03b12M) enzyme- linked immuno -\nsorbent assay (ELISA) were used to assess local and systemic inflammation. Static \nweight bearing (total internal reflection) and range of motion (ROM) were collected \nfor functional assessment.\nResults: The ROM and weight- bearing symmetry decreased after the procedure \nand recovered slowly with still significant deficit at the end of the study for both \ngroups. Histological analysis confirmed fibrosis in both lateral and posterior peri -\narticular tissue. Vitamin E supplementation showed a moderate anti-  inflammatory \neffect on the local and systemic levels. The vitamin E group exhibited significant \nimprovement in ROM and weight- bearing symmetry at day 84 compared to the \ncontrol group.\nConclusions: This model is viable for simulating arthrofibrosis after joint replacement. \nVitamin E may benefit postsurgical arthrofibrosis, and further studies are needed for \ndosing requirements.\nKEYWORDS\narthrofibrosis, range of motion, total knee arthroplasty, vitamin E\n146\u2003 |\u2003\u2003\u2002\nFAN  et al.\n1\u2003|\u2003INTRODUCTION\nArthrofibrosis is a joint disorder characterized by excessive scar tis -\nsue production within the joint and surrounding soft tissues1\u20133 via \nmetaplastic fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) \ndeposition.4 Arthrofibrosis is a common complication after total \nknee arthroplasty (TKA) with nearly 85\u2009000 annual cases in the \nUnited States.5 Patients present clinically with pain and restricted \nrange of motion (ROM), which severely hinder postoperative reha -\nbilitation, clinical outcomes, and basic activities of daily living, de -\ncreasing the patients' quality of life.6\nArthrofibrosis is believed to be caused by dysregulation of innate \nand adaptive immunity. The primary surgical treatments for arthro -\nfibrosis are manipulation under anesthesia, arthroscopic lysis of ad -\nhesions, and removal of ECM. Surgical intervention can increase the \ndysregulation of fibrosis,3 resulting in worsening or reoccurrence. \nJoint contracture can progress rapidly clinically and is challenging \nto reverse.7 Although  the  definitiv e  cause  is  not  understood,  pro -\ngression involves the transforming growth factor-  \u03b2 (TGF-  \u03b2) signaling \npathway.3,8 Surgery and injury cause oxidative stress and an inflam -\nmatory response, including the recruitment of pro-  inflammatory \ncytokines9 a n d  T G F -  \u03b2.10 These cytokines activate myofibroblasts \nleading to fibrosis, but some of this response is necessary for healing \nthe injured or disrupted tissue.11 Early interruption of the myofibro -\nblast axis, for example, inhibiting TGF-  \u03b2 signaling, may be promising \nin limiting the progression of fibrogenesis.12 We hypothesize that \npreventative treatment reducing the inflammatory response may \nprovide a therapeutic advantage.\nThe rat is a reliable model for arthrofibrosis,7,13 which has com -\nmonly been achieved through limb immobilization after traumatic \ninjury.14,15 We recently developed a rat model to simulate TKA by \nincorporating joint implant components as well as by introducing the \nbone and soft tissue trauma associated with surgery.16 Arthrogenic \ncontracture has been shown to occur within 2\u2009weeks of immobiliza -\ntion in other models, with continuous loss of ROM.17 ROM, histolog -\nical, and immunohistological analyses are the key measurements to \nassess the extent and progress of the condition. One of the aims of \nthis study was to establish a clinically relevant arthrofibrosis model \nin the rat after our simulated TKA. We evaluated postoperative \nstatic weight-  bearing asymmetry, ROM, and reflex response as func -\ntional recovery and pain measures.\nThe second aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the \nantioxidant vitamin E in the progression of arthrofibrosis. Vitamin \nE is an abundant and potent antioxidant, whose major role is to \nprotect polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cell membranes from \noxidative degradation.18 Vitamin E was shown to treat pulmonary \nfibrosis and fatty liver disease in rodents.19\u201321 Thus, we hypoth -\nesize that vitamin E can reduce fibrosis in periarticular tissues \nand prevent subsequent functional progression through reduced \ninflammation. Establishing the arthrofibrosis rat model will help \nus understand the time dependence of the functional outcome \nand the relationship between inflammation and function in this \ninjury. The long-  term aim of this study is to assess the effects of prevention and treatment strategies on joint fibrosis in the post -\noperative period.\n2\u2003|\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1\u2003 |\u2003 Animals and study timeline\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Care and Use \nCommittee of Massachusetts General Hospital (2020\u2009N000081). \nAdult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats ( n\u2009=\u200916) were fed facility chow and \nwater ad libitum and randomly assigned to the groups (250\u2013350\u2009g, \nCharles River, Wilmington, MA). The timelines of all procedures are \nshown in Figure  S1. The number of animals used and the frequency \nof observations for each endpoint measurement at every time point \nare presented in Table  S3. All groups underwent a simulated TKA on \nthe right hind limb. The surgical limb was immobilized using suture \nfor 2\u2009weeks to stimulate the development of arthrofibrosis.\nControl group C1 ( n\u2009=\u20095) was euthanized at 2\u2009weeks, control group \nC2 ( n\u2009=\u20095) was euthanized at 12\u2009weeks, and test group E1 ( n\u2009=\u20096) was \nsupplemented with water containing vitamin E until euthanasia at \n12\u2009weeks. Animals were acclimated for at least 2\u2009days preoperatively. \nThe day before surgery, preoperative measurements were collected. \nStatic weight bearing using total internal reflection (TIR) imaging  \nin a custom-  designed device (supplementary information and \nFigure  S6 S1), toe spread (using video recording of gait,22 PROMON \nU750, AOS Technologies), and ROM were measured. Body weights \nand blood were also collected. Postoperative measurements were \ncollected on postoperative days (PODs) 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84. \nOn PODs 14 and 84, the animals were euthanized, and gastrocne -\nmius muscles from both hind limbs and posterior and lateral capsular \ntissues were collected. The presence and severity of arthrofibrosis \nand systemic inflammation were investigated using histological anal -\nysis and \u03b12- macroglobulin ( \u03b12M) enzyme-  linked immunosorbent \nassay (ELISA) (ab157730, Abcam). Vitamin E ( \u03b1- tocopherol) was \nquantified using high-  pressure liquid chromatography with tandem \nmass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS).\n2.2\u2003 |\u2003 Surgical procedure: simulated TKA and limb \nimmobilization\nRats (body weight: 250\u2013350\u2009g, age: 9\u201311\u2009weeks) received preop -\nerative buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 30\u2009min before \nisoflurane anesthesia (1%\u20133% isoflurane in 1\u2009L of O2 per minute for \nmaintenance). The surgical limb (right hind limb) was shaved and \nscrubbed with 10% povidone-  iodine solution. A 3\u20134\u2009cm lateral inci -\nsion was used to expose the knee joint. A simulated knee replace -\nment procedure involving a transcondylar femoral implantation \nof a 3.0\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0\u2009mm cylindrical polyethylene plug and implantation \nof a titanium screw (1.3\u2009mm in diameter, 8\u2009mm in length, Synthes, \nMonument, CO) in the tibial canal was performed.16 The wound was \nclosed using 5\u20130 Vicryl deep dermal sutures, and the skin was closed \n\u2003\u2002\u2003|\u2003 147\nFAN  et al.\nusing staples. The surgical leg was immobilized using 5\u20130 Vicryl su -\nture in full flexion. All animals received postoperative buprenorphine \n(0.05\u2009mg/kg, Subcutaneously) at 12\u2009h intervals for 72\u2009h. We moni -\ntored weight and gross or systemic signs of infection, such as skin \nnecrosis, pus, or centrally elevated temperature every other day. We \ndid not encounter any of these criteria.\n2.3\u2003 |\u2003 Weight monitoring\nAll animals were weighed to ensure their overall health. \nMeasurements were taken on PODs 3, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84.\n2.4\u2003 |\u2003 Vitamin E supplementation\nGroup E1 was supplemented with water containing water-  soluble \nnatural vitamin E ad libitum (0.2\u2009mg/mL, Kentucky Performance \nProducts, Versailles, KY) for the duration of the study. Dosages \n(20\u2009mg/kg/day) were guided by previous literature20 and veterinar -\nian consultation. Average daily vitamin E intake was calculated using \nwater-  level measurements of each cage.\n2.5\u2003 |\u2003 Histological analysis\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining: collected tissues were har -\nvested and fixed in 4% formalin for 24\u2009h before being dehydrated \nin 70% ethanol. All samples were processed and embedded in par -\naffin and sectioned. The tissues were stained with H&E to exam -\nine inflammation and fibrosis formation.23 The slides were scanned \nand analyzed using image analysis software (NanoZoomer Digital \nPathology, Meyer Instruments, Inc., Houston, TX).\nPicrosirius Red staining: tissue sections were fixed in 10% \nneutral-  buffered formaldehyde solution, and the slides were stored \nin an oven at 60\u00b0C overnight. Tissue sections were deparaffinized in \nCitriSolv clearing agent (1601H, Decon Labs), rehydrated in graded \nalcohol, and washed in running water for 30\u2009min. The sections were \nstained in 0.1% Picro-  Sirius Red solution (365548-  5\u2009g, Sirius Red, \nSigma, Burlington, MA; P6744-  1 GA, picric acid solution, Sigma) \nfor 2\u2009h. After staining, the sections were dipped in 100% alcohol \n(3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 dips), in CitriSolv (3\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009min) and covered by a coverslip with \nPermount (SP15-  500, Fisher Scientific).\nHuman sample collection and analysis: the Institutional Review \nBoard (1999P001235) approved the collection of human tissues \nat the time of arthroplasty. Discarded posterior capsules of ar -\nthroplasty patients were collected. The tissues were identified as \n\u201chealthy\u201d or \u201carthrofibrotic\u201d based on clinical diagnosis. In this study, \nwe present histology from the tissues of one arthrofibrotic patient.\nQuantification of fibrotic area: three unaffiliated blinded review -\ners were trained to indicate fibrotic areas on histology slides using the \nfollowing criteria: presence of synovial hyperplasia, red\u2212/pink-  lined \ncollagen fibers, fibroblasts, or inflammatory cells. The arthrofibrosis area excluded fat cells, muscles, vessels, and blank regions. The total \ntissue and arthrofibrosis area were measured using image analysis \nsoftware (NanoZoomer Digital Pathology, Meyer Instruments, Inc.). \nArthrofibrosis area %\u2009= \u2009arthrofibrosis area/total tissue area.\n2.6\u2003 |\u2003 Immunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemical staining was performed for interleukin 6 (IL-  \n6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-  \u237a). IL- 6 polyclonal antibody \n(ARC0062, ThermoFisher) and anti-  TNF-  \u03b1 antibody (Ab269772, \nAbcam) were used. All antibodies were diluted 1:200 in antibody dilu -\nent (S0809, Dako). For antigen extraction, an antigen retrieval solution \nwas used (10 \u00d7 homemade antigen retrieval solution [pH\u20098.5]: 250\u2009mM \nTris\u2013HCl [501\u2009031\u2009386, Fisher Scientific] and 250\u2009mL [1\u2009M stock, 1:4 \ndilution]; 10\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [BP2482500, Fisher \nScientific] and 20\u2009mL [0.5 stock, 1:50 dilution]; 0.5% sodium dodecyl \nsulfate [J63394, Alfa Aesar] and 25\u2009mL [20% stock, 1:40 dilution]; \ndH2O: 705\u2009mL). After 30\u2009min in blocking buffer, the slides were incu -\nbated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C in a moisture cham -\nber. In the negative control, no primary antibody was used. The slides \nwere washed extensively in Tris-  buffered saline (TBS). After 10\u2009min \nin blocking buffer, the slides were incubated in the dark for 2\u2009h with \nfluorescent-  conjugated secondary antibody (Goat Anti Rabbit Alexa \nFluor 568 Rabbit [A11011, ThermoFisher] and Goat Anti Mouse \nAlexa Fluor 647 Mouse [A21236, ThermoFisher]), washed again \nin TBS (4\u2009\u00d7 \u20095\u2009min), and then washed in distilled water. The sections \nwere mounted with coverslips using DAPI mounting media (P36935, \nSlowFade Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI, Invitrogen).\n2.7\u2003 |\u2003 Blood collection and analysis\nBlood was collected ( ~150\u2009\u03bc L) from the lateral tail vein and centri -\nfuged at 3300\u2009rpm for 15\u2009min. Serum was then collected and stored \nat \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis. \u03b12M ELISA (ab157730, Abcam) was \nperformed to determine the concentration of \u03b12M in serum. The \nconcentration ratios for each animal were calculated using the base -\nline concentration of that animal (collected preoperatively).\n2.8\u2003 |\u2003 Quantification of vitamin E concentration in \nplasma and tissues\nFrozen plasma (20\u2009\u03bc L), skin, and muscle were thawed and prepared for \nLC\u2013MS/MS analysis. We homogenized the skin and muscle samples in \n1\u2009mL of LC\u2013MS-  grade water. We prepared 10\u2009\u03bc g/mL of internal stand -\nard (\u03b4- tocopherol analytical standard, Sigma-  Aldrich, 47\u2009784) solution \nin 0.2\u2009mg/mL of ascorbic acid (Sigma-  Aldrich, A4544) in methanol24 \nand added 50\u2009\u03bc L of internal standard to each sample tube. We added \n2\u2009mL of hexane, purged the tube with nitrogen, and then placed the \ntube in an ultrasonic bath for 10\u2009min.25 Later ,  the  samples  were  in -\ncubated in an oven at 70\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. The mixtures were vortexed \n148\u2003 |\u2003\u2003\u2002\nFAN  et al.\nand centrifuged at 2000\u2009g  for 10\u2009min to precipitate cell debris and \nproteins. The separated hexane phase was collected and transferred \ninto another tube. An additional 2\u2009mL of hexane was added to each \nsample tube, vortexed, and centrifuged again for 10\u2009min at 2000\u2009g . \nThe separated hexane phase was collected and combined for each \nsample with previous collections. The hexane was filtered with 0.2\u2009\u03bc m \npolytetrafluoroethylene filters and placed in a vacuum oven at 37\u00b0C. \nWe added 100\u2009\u03bc L and 250\u2009\u03bc L of 0.2\u2009mg/mL ascorbic acid in methanol \nsolution in serum and tissue samples, respectively. \u03b1- Tocopherol was \nanalyzed using an LC\u2013MS/MS system, Ultivo liquid chromatography \ntriple-  quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent). The detailed proce -\ndures and calibration information are shown in Figures  S2 and S3. The \nvitamin E concentrations in the plasma, skin, and muscle of the control \nand vitamin E groups are shown in Figure  S4.\n2.9\u2003 |\u2003 Range of motion\nRange of motion (ROM) measurements of the surgical limb were \ntaken using a goniometer ( Figure  S5B). The rats were anesthetized \nusing isoflurane inhalation (1%\u20133% isoflurane in 1\u2009L of O2 per minute \nfor maintenance). The limb was extended and flexed to full exten -\nsion and flexion positions, and the angles of the tibia and femur were \nmeasured and recorded.\n2.10\u2003 |\u2003 Static weight bearing\nHind-  limb weight-  bearing measurements were made using a custom-  \nbuilt platform using TIR as the measurement principle ( Figure  S6). \nVoltage levels of LED (light emitting diode) lights were adjusted \nso that the limit of detection was quantifiable for pressures at and \nabove 0.55\u2009g/mm. The rats were placed in the plexiglass container, \nand worm-  eye view videos were recorded for 5\u2009min. The videos were \nassessed in MATLAB (Matlab, Mathworks) to find eight distinct in -\nstances in which the rat was standing only on its hind limbs. Using \nimages of the LED pawprints, the intensity of each print was calcu -\nlated using a custom code to determine the weight distribution ratio \nbetween the hind limbs for each rat.\n2.11\u2003 |\u2003 Toe spread\nA walking arena was built for gait analysis using GAITOR Suite.22 \nGait videos were recorded at 400 fps and\u2009~\u20091350\u2009\u03bc s of exposure time \n(PROMON U750, AOS Technologies, Switzerland). A minimum of \nthree gait trials were collected for each rat at each time point. Gait \nvideos were analyzed using ImageJ. Using the dorsal view, frames \ndepicting flush contact of each paw with the glass floor were identi -\nfied. Using the ventral view camera, 1\u20135 and 2\u20134 toe spread (five \nmeasurements per animal) values were measured manually. The \nratio of these measurements between the surgical paw (right) and \nthe control (left) paw was calculated.2.12\u2003 |\u2003 Statistical analyses\nPaired t- tests were performed between and within control and ex -\nperimental groups on ROM, weight-  bearing asymmetry, and ELISA \nresults that were collected throughout the study to compare any \nchanges between days. Significant differences were determined as \np- values <0.05 (SAS).\n3\u2003|\u2003RESULTS\n3.1\u2003 |\u2003 Vitamin E supplementation\nBased on the daily water intake measurements, the rats in the con -\ntrol group drank 34.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\u2009mL of water per day, whereas those in the \nvitamin E group drank 42.1\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u2009mL. The vitamin E group ingested an \naverage of 8.42\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\u2009mg of vitamin E per day for the duration of the \nstudy ( Table  S1).\nThe amount of vitamin E in the control group when killed was \n0.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009\u03bc g/mL, 2.14\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009ng/mg, and 1.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75\u2009ng/mg in the \nplasma, skin, and muscle, respectively. The amount of vitamin E in \nthe treatment group was 1.51\u2009\u00b1\u20090.49\u2009\u03bc g/mL, 4.08\u2009\u00b1\u20091.76\u2009ng/mg, and \n4.63\u2009\u00b1\u20094.38\u2009ng/mg, respectively. The vitamin E level in the vitamin E \ngroup was significantly higher than that in the control groups in the \nplasma, skin, and muscle ( p\u2009<\u20090.05, Figure  S4).\n3.2\u2003 |\u2003 Fibrosis analysis\nH&E and Picrosirius staining showed fibrosis in the posterior and \nlateral knee capsule tissue samples for control and experimental \ngroups, as shown by the increased presence of fibroblasts and \nsynovial hyperplasia ( Figures  1 and 2 ). The control groups showed \nsynovial hyperplasia in the posterior capsule and dense fibroblast \ncells in the lateral side of the surgical limb. The nonsurgical (left) \nlimb in the control groups showed muscle fiber without fibrosis \n(Figure  1A). The arthrofibrosis area was significantly increased in \nthe lateral-  surgical limb than in the lateral-  nonsurgical limb in the \ncontrol group ( p\u2009<\u20090.05, Figure  S8). Picrosirius staining showed \nred collagen fiber in the posterior and lateral capsules in the \nsurgical limb of the control group. In contrast, the muscle fiber \nand cytoplasm stained yellow in the nonsurgical limb of the con -\ntrol group. Epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium containing \ntype I collagen were red in the nonsurgical (left) limb of controls \n(Figure  1B). Red collagen fiber in the posterior capsule from a \nclinical sample collected from an arthrofibrosis patient was simi -\nlar to that in the rat tissue ( Figure  1C). In contrast, there was \nno red staining in the nonarthrofibrosis human posterior capsule \nsample ( Figure  1C).\nIn the vitamin E\u2013treated group, H&E staining qualitatively \nshowed thinner fibrosis tissue in the posterior capsule and a tran -\nsition of the fibrosis tissue to muscle tissue on the lateral side of \nthe surgical (right) limb ( Figure  2A). There was some dispersed \n\u2003\u2002\u2003|\u2003 149\nFAN  et al.\nred staining in the Picrosirius-  stained sections ( Figure  2B). The \nfibrotic area was significantly higher in the surgical side com -\npared to that on the nonsurgical tissue, but the fibrotic area was less in the vitamin E\u2013treated group only on the lateral side com -\npared to that in the control group lateral capsule surgical limb \n(Figure  S8).FIGURE 1\u2003(A) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of lateral and posterior knee capsule tissues from the left (post-  nonsurgical) and \nright (lateral-  surgical) limbs of the control group at 12\u2009weeks postintervention. The top panels exhibit detailed views of the muscle tissue, \nwith arrows indicating myocytes (muscle fibers) and myocyte nuclei in nonsurgical and surgical contexts, respectively. The bottom panels \nprovide a broader perspective of the knee capsule, depicting normal tissue architecture in the nonsurgical limb versus signs of pathological \nchanges in the surgical limb, such as synovial hyperplasia and fibroblast proliferation, which are labeled in the surgical panels. Synovial \nhyperplasia signifies a pathological increase in the number of synovial cells, contributing to joint thickening and potential dysfunction. \nScale bar: 100\u2009\u03bc m, 1\u2009mm. (B) Picrosirius Red staining of lateral and posterior knee capsule tissues from nonsurgical (left) and surgical (right) \nlimbs of the control group, observed at 12\u2009weeks postprocedure. The staining technique highlights the collagen fiber organization within \nthe connective tissue layers surrounding the muscle. The two left columns display the nonsurgical tissues with normal collagen alignment, \nwhereas the two right columns show the surgical tissues with altered collagen distribution. Arrows in the bottom-  left panel identify the \nstructural components of the muscle connective tissue: epimysium, the outer layer; perimysium, the intermediate layer; and endomysium, \nthe inner layer surrounding individual muscle fibers.

There \nwere some bright loci in the TNF-  \u03b1 signal and in the IL-  6 signal in the \nlateral-  surgical limb of the control group ( Figure  3A), whereas the \nstaining signal was dispersed in the vitamin E group ( Figure  3B). \u03b12M \nlevels, which were 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 in the control group and 0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 in the \nvitamin E group immediately after surgery, decreased significantly \nthereafter and remained low for both control and vitamin E groups \n(Figure  4). No significant differences were found between control \nand vitamin E groups with regard to \u03b1 2M levels.3.4\u2003 |\u2003 Range of motion\nThe ROM in extension decreased from 170\u00b0 on POD 0 to 131\u00b0 on \nPOD 14 for both control and vitamin E groups before increasing \nagain throughout the course of the study ( Figure  5A). The ROM was \nsignificantly different at all time points compared to POD 0 and did \nnot recover to baseline for either group. The only difference be -\ntween groups was observed on POD 84 ( Figure  5B).\nThe ROM in flexion showed a steady increasing trend for both \ngroups and was ~20\u00b0 higher than baseline at the end of the study \n(Figure  5C). The ROM in flexion was significantly higher than the \npreoperative baseline for the control groups on POD 70 and for the \nvitamin E group on PODs 28, 56, 70, and 84. The change in flex -\nion was also significant for the groups on these days ( Figure  5D).

ROM extension showed a strong negative correla -\ntion with 1\u20135 toe spread and 2\u20134 toe spread values for the control \ngroup ( R\u2009>\u20090.6; Figures  S7 and S10 ).\n4\u2003|\u2003DISCUSSION\nThe presence of arthrofibrosis was evaluated qualitatively using \nhistological analysis. Myofibroblasts are the essential effector cells \nof fibrosis26 and can be found in most fibro-  contractive diseases.27 \nMyofibroblasts produce TGF-  \u03b2, IL- 1\u03b2, IL- 6, and reactive oxygen \nspecies, further activating a fibrotic response.28 Visualization of \nthe fibrotic tissue and the ECM using H&E staining, which presents \nthe presence and density of fibroblasts,29 showed that immobili -\nzation after TKA resulted in fibroblast infiltration and synovial hy -\nperplasia ( Figure  1A). Picrosirius Red staining, which is indicative \nof collagen production and orientation, confirmed the overpro -\nduction of collagen fibers in both the lateral and posterior capsular \ntissues ( Figure  1B). These histological observations in the control \ngroup suggested the formation and sustenance of arthrofibrosis. \nIncreased capsule thickness in the posterior and lateral histologic \nsections was also reported in a model where the posterior capsule \nwas disrupted through hyperextension of the knee joint.13 In our model for post-  TKA arthrofibrosis, we implanted hardware in the \nfemur and tibia instead of causing posterior capsule disruption. \nThe fibrosis area significantly increased in the lateral-  surgical limb \ncompared to the lateral-  nonsurgical control limb ( Figure  S8), pre -\nsumably because of the more robust nature of the trauma-  induced \ninflammatory reaction at the neighboring lateral and posterior \ncapsular tissues. H&E and Picrosirius staining of the tissues of the \nvitamin E group showed decreased fibrosis and collagen fibrilla -\ntion, respectively, consistent with our hypotheses ( Figure  2A,B ).\nSystemic inflammation, assessed by \u03b12M as an analog to C-  \nreactive protein in humans,30 increased at 2\u2009weeks in the controls, \nin contrast to that of the vitamin E group, suggesting that pre -\ntreated vitamin E may decrease the acute early-  phase inflammation \n(Figure  4). Systemic inflammation was not different between the \ntwo groups over the remainder of the study, pointing to the neces -\nsity of investigating the local tissue response separately. The pres -\nence of the inflammatory marker IL-  6 was associated with fibrosis \nin the lung31 and can act via shifting acute inflammation into a more \nchronic profibrotic state.32 Immunofluorescence results from the \ncontrol group at 2\u2009weeks showed a positive IL-  6 signal and a weaker \nTNF-  \u03b1 signal in the surgical limb ( Figure  S9C). These signals may not \nincrease concurrently in the local inflammatory response as TNF-  \u03b1 \nwas shown to block some inflammatory cytokines, including IL-  1\u03b2, \nand IL-  6,33 and its role in organ fibrosis remains controversial.34 The \nvitamin E group presented no TNF-  \u03b1 signal and a very weak IL -  6  \nsignal only on the lateral capsular tissue, showing a modest anti-  \ninflammatory effect after 12\u2009weeks ( Figure  3A,B ), consistent with \nour hypothesis.\nArthrofibrosis is mainly diagnosed by clinical assessment and \nverified by histopathologic analysis. After knee surgery, patients \nwith clinically significant loss of knee extension and/or flexion ( <90\u00b0 \nof passive flexion and <10\u00b0 of full extension) are considered for the \ndiagnosis of arthrofibrosis.8,35 Neither the control nor the vitamin E \ngroup fully recovered to standard extension and flexion ( Figures  5), FIGURE 6\u2003Weight-  bearing ratio of (A) right-  and left hind limbs and (B) toe spread1\u20135 as a function of time. Asterisk indicates significant \ndifference between designated POD (postoperative day) and POD 0 values ( p\u2009<\u20090.05). Shaded area is the margin of error from the database \nof healthy animals.\n(A) (B)\n154\u2003 |\u2003\u2003\u2002\nFAN  et al.\nwhich supported the expected clinical outcome. The effect of vita -\nmin E on ROM was not significant except for a modest difference \nin the long-  term extension; we attribute this result to the dose of \nthe vitamin E administration not being sufficient. At the same time, \nweight-  bearing symmetry after the release of the immobilization \nwas higher for the vitamin E group throughout the study, suggest -\ning a better functional outcome ( Figure  6B). In addition, toe spread \n(Figure  6B), which we have found to be a good marker of the general \nwell-  being and recovery of the animals, recovered faster for the vi -\ntamin E group. Overall, treatment with vitamin E in a periprosthetic \njoint infection (PJI) model starting preoperatively could have some \nbenefit in decreasing inflammation and could accelerate postoper -\native recovery.\nThe limitation of the study is that vitamin E supplementation \nby drinking water may not be optimal in controlling the dose and \nobtaining the desired therapeutic range of vitamin E in the tis -\nsues. The vitamin E intake was 8.42\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\u2009mg of vitamin E per day \n(16.84\u2009 \u00b1\u20094.6\u2009mg/kg/day). Although the amount of vitamin E in the \nskin and muscle was significantly higher than that in the control \ngroup ( Figure  S4), the longitudinal profile in the plasma indicated \nthat a higher level could be reached on POD 56, indicating the dose \nmay have been under the therapeutic range at early time points. \nFurther study should focus on the dosing and alternative adminis -\ntrated routes.\n5\u2003|\u2003CONCLUSIONS\nThe results showed that this model is viable for simulating arthrofi -\nbrosis after TKA. Although vitamin E did decrease inflammation \nand there was a trend in vitamin E supplementation resulting in less \nfunctional disruption in the later stages, the differences between \nthe control and vitamin E groups were small. It is possible that in -\ncreasing the dosage of vitamin E or using an alternative route of \nadministration (subcutaneous, intra-  articular) may lead to more sig -\nnificant effects.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nYingfang Fan: substantial contributions toward performing sur -\ngery and research design, and the acquisition, analysis, and in -\nterpretation of data; drafting the paper and revising it critically; \napproval of the submitted and final versions.
