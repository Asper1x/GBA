Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which is formed during \u029f-carnitine metabolism, promotes the formation of\natherosclerotic plaques, causing thrombosis. Here, we elucidated the anti-atherosclerotic effect and mechanism of ginger ( Zingiber\nof\ufb01cinale Roscoe) essential oil (GEO) and its bioactive compound citral in Gubra Amylin NASH (GAN) diet with \u029f-carnitine-induced\natherosclerosis female ApoE\u2212/\u2212mice. Treatment with GEO at both low and high doses and citral inhibited the formation of aortic\natherosclerotic lesions, improved plasma lipid pro \ufb01le, reduced blood sugar, improved insulin resistance, decreased plasma TMAO\nlevels, and inhibited plasma in \ufb02ammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-1 \u03b2. Additionally, GEO and citral treatment modulated gut\nmicrobiota diversity and composition by increasing the abundance of bene \ufb01cial microbes and decreasing the abundance of CVD-\nrelated microbes. Overall, these results showed that GEO and citral may serve as potential dietary supplements for CVD prevention\nby improving gut microbiota dysbiosis.\nnpj Science of Food            (2023) 7:19 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-023-00196-0\nINTRODUCTION\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a severe health problem and one\nof the leading causes of death globally1. The primary causes of\nCVD includes unhealthy diet and insuf \ufb01cient physical activity2. The\ngut microbiota and its metabolites are strongly associated with\ndietary intake and have recently been identi \ufb01ed as an emerging\nrisk factor for CVD3. High animal-protein consumption is a primary\ninducer of CVD risk factors and is associated with CVD3,4. Several\nfood components from red meat, poultry, and dairy products,\nsuch as phosphatidylcholine, choline, and \u029f-carnitine, can be\nmetabolized via meta-organismal metabolism involving speci \ufb01c\ngut microbiome and host to form \u03b3-butyrobetaine ( \u03b3BB),\ntrimethylamine (TMA), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)5.\nAdditionally, TMA can be subsequently oxidized to TMAO by the\nhost hepatic \ufb02avin monooxygenase6, and high blood TMAO levels\nare associated with cardiovascular events and mortality7. The\natherogenic effects of TMAO include increased foam cellformation, reduced reverse cholesterol transport, enhanced\nplatelet aggregation, and promotion of kidney \ufb01brosis\n6,8,9; more-\nover, TMAO also causes vascular in \ufb02ammation10.\nObesity is strongly linked to CVD11. In animals, mice fed high-\nfat diet (HFD) showed elevated levels of circulating TMAO, which\nwas associated with cardiac dysfunction12. Moreover, an HFD\nanimal model with gut microbiota imbalance is essential for\nstudying the gut-liver axis13. Recently, an emerging Western diet\ncalled Gubra Amylin NASH diet (GAN diet) has been developedto induce several high cholesterol-related diseases, including\nobesity and CVD. GAN diet is composed of 40 kcal% fat (primarilyfrom palm oil), 20 kcal% fructose, and 2% cholesterol\n14.G A N\ndiet-fed mouse model exhibits the advantage of translatability tohumans in terms of liver biopsy phenotype\n15. Thus, combining\nGAN diet with \u029f-carnitine may potentially elevate blood TMAO\nlevels and allow the investigation of atherosclerosis-relatedmechanisms. Atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-de \ufb01cient\n(ApoE\n\u2212/\u2212) mouse model is a valuable tool for studying\nthe development of atherosclerotic plaques. ApoE\u2212/\u2212mice are\nde\ufb01cient in the ability to clear lipoproteins, resulting in the\naccumulation of cholesterol ester-enriched particle in blood,which can promote atherosclerosis\n16.\nPreventive medicine is the practice of promoting preventive\nhealth care to avert disease development. Several foods and herbs\ncan alleviate the progression of CVD and atherosclerosis3,17.\nGinger is a herbal dietary component with potential bene \ufb01ts\nagainst CVD, including reducing total blood cholesterol and pro-\nin\ufb02ammatory cytokine levels and improving insulin resistance18.\nGinger essential oil (GEO), the volatile oil obtained from freshginger, can reduce plasmas levels of total cholesterol and totaltriglycerides and insulin in HFD-induced obese mice\n19. Citral, a\nprimary components of GEO, has been shown to exert anti-obesity\neffect19.

After 16 weeks, the mice\nwere sacri \ufb01ced and aortic lesions were visualized using oil red O\nstaining (Fig. 1b). Aortic lesion formation signi \ufb01cantly increased\n(p< 0.0001) by 212% (13.1 \u00b1 2.4%) in the GC group compared with\ncontrol (CON) group (4.2 \u00b1 1.2%), indicating successful inductionof atherosclerosis using GAN diet and \u029f-carnitine (Fig. 1c).\nHowever, treatment with low-dose GEO, high dose GEO, andcitral signi \ufb01cantly reduced the occurrence of aortic plaques by\n23% ( p=0.0311), 20% ( p=0.0610), and 29% ( p=0.0043),\nrespectively. Additionally, the plasma levels of lipidemic biomar-\nkers, including total triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein choles-terol (LDL-C), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), wereexamined (Fig. 1d\u2013h). Compared with the CON group, plasma\ncholesterol ( p< 0.0001), HDL-C ( p=0.0008), and LDL-C(p< 0.0001) levels were signi \ufb01cantly elevated in the GC group,\nindicating that this intervention affected the circulation of lipids.\nHowever, there was no signi \ufb01cant difference in plasma total\ntriglyceride and ox-LDL levels between the CON and GC groups.\nTreatment with GEO and citral caused a decreasing trend in\nplasma cholesterol and LDL-C levels in ApoE\n\u2212/\u2212mice compared\nwith the GC group; moreover, high-dose GEO and citral increased\nplasma HDL-C levels ( p=0.0015 and p=0.0054, respectively).\nHowever, there were no signi \ufb01cant differences in the plasma\nlevels of several biomarkers between low and high GEO groups,\nwhich may be because the effect of GEO on plasma biochemical\nindices peaked at 50 mg/kg bw/day and higher doses did not\ninduce any signi \ufb01cant change.

The primary multistep meta-\norganismal (gut microbiota and host) pathway for TMAOproduction through carnitine metabolism is as follows:\n\u029f-carnitine\n\u2192\u03b3-butyrobetaine ( \u03b3BB)\u2192TMA\u2192TMAO22.

Additionally, therewas a decreasing trend in plasma \u03b3-BB levels in the citral and GEO\ntreatment group, with more obvious decrease observed in citral\ntreatment group ( p=0.0663).\nSince gut microbiota plays a critical role in the development of\nCVD and atherosclerosis, we examined the effect of GC, GEO, and\ncitral on gut microbiota. To achieve this, the microbiotacompositions of fecal samples were examined using V3 \u2013V4 16 S\nrRNA sequencing technique.

These data indicated that diet (control diet or GAN\ndiet with \u029f-carnitine) was the primary factor in \ufb02uencing fecal\nmicrobiota at the genus level. The GC cluster consisted of 29genera, whereas the CON cluster consisted of 18. GEO and citraltreatments formed sub-clusters within the GC-induced cluster,indicating that GEO and citral played a secondary role in altering\ngut microbiota. The top panel indicates the degree of aortic\nlesions and TMA and TMAO levels in the treatment groups.Compared with the CON group, aortic lesion formation and TMAand TMAO levels were signi \ufb01cantly higher in the GC group;\nhowever, GEO and citral treatment reversed these parameters.Statistical analyses were performed to determine signi \ufb01cant\ndifferences between the group, and the pvalues are displayed\nin the left panel.\nCompared with the CON group, the GC group was enriched in\nCVD-related bacteria, including Enterorhabdus ,Romboutsia ,Pro-\nteus,Eubacterium nodatum group ,Escherichia-Shigella ,Eubacterium\ncoprostanoligenes group ,Parasutterella ,Muribaculum , and Enter-\nococcus , and there was a decrease in the abundance of several\nbene \ufb01cial microbiotas, such as Bi\ufb01dobacterium and Alistipes .

Compared\nwith the GC group, a total of 16, 13, and 13 signi \ufb01cantly different\ngenera were identi \ufb01ed in the low-dose GEO, high-dose GEO, and\ncitral groups, respectively. Interestingly, GEO treatment reducedthe relative abundance of the CVD-associated bacteria Enter-\norhabdus and Proteus but increased the abundance of the\nbene \ufb01cial bacteria Allobaculum . Additionally, citral treatment\ndecreased the abundance of Proteus but increased Allobaculum\nand Dubosiella .\nFurthermore, Spearman \u2019s correlation analysis was performed to\nassess the relationship between the signi \ufb01cant genus and CVD-\nrelated biomarkers, including aortic lesion, TMA, TMAO, GEO, andcitral. Seven genera, including Eubacterium coprostanoligenes\ngroup ,Parasutterella ,Enterohabdus ,Akkermansia ,Romboutsia,\nProteus , and Olsenella (a microbiome associated with CVD), were\npositively correlated with aortic lesions. Fifteen genera, includingthe bene \ufb01cial bacteria Bi\ufb01dobacterium and Alistipes , were nega-\ntively correlated with aortic lesions. Interestingly, CVD-related\nEnterohabdus was positively correlated with plasma TMAO levels.\nGEO was positively associated with a healthy microbiomeconsisting of Akkermansia , whereas citral was positively correlated\nwith Allobaculum and Dubosiella . In summary, the heatmap and\ncorrelation data indicated that GC adversely affected gutmicrobiota, resulting in microbiota dysbiosis. However, GEO andcitral exhibited a favorable effect and improved general gut\nmicrobiota composition, indicating that GEO and citral treatment\nrestored gut microbiota and ameliorated atherosclerosis in GCApoE\n\u2212/\u2212mouse model.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we examined the anti-atherosclerotic effect\nand mechanism of GEO and citral in mice. GEO and citral\ntreatment ameliorated atherosclerosis in ApoE\u2212/\u2212mice by\nsuppressing meta-organismal metabolism of gut microbiota-host-derived TMA and TMAO and remodeling gut microbiota\ncomposition. Additionally, GEO and citral treatment signi \ufb01cantly\nlowered plasma IL-1 \u03b2, TNF- \u03b1, glucose, and insulin levels. Several\nstudies have shown that ginger possesses cardioprotective\n23, anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory19, anti-microbial24, and glucose-modulating func-\ntions20. Dietary ginger extract has been shown to suppress TMAO-\ninduced increase in plasma cholesterol in mice and improve anti-in\ufb02ammatory response by lowering plasma TNF- \u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, and IL-6\nlevels\n18.\nHyperlipidemia is the most crucial risk factor for atherosclerosis,\nwhich is the primary cause of CVD25. In the present study, GC\ntreatment increased total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels,\nwhich was attributed the GAN diet (contained 2% cholesterol and\n40 kcal% of fat, mainly from palm oil). The intake of palm oil-containing HFD has been shown to elevate blood cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels\n14,15. GEO and citral treatment did not decrease\ntotal cholesterol and LDL-C levels but increased HDL-C levels,\nindicating their bene \ufb01cial effect on blood lipid pro \ufb01le. Addition-\nally, GC increased plasma glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels,\ncon\ufb01rming its potential in induce metabolic syndrome, which was\nconsistent with previous \ufb01ndings14,15. However, GEO and citral\ntreatment signi \ufb01cantly improved fasting blood glucose level and\ninsulin resistance, thus improving glucose homeostasis. There was\nno signi \ufb01cant difference in total plasma triglyceride levels\nbetween the groups. Since the triglyceride and cholesterolcontent in HFD is high, excessive cholesterol intake downregulatesthe production of cholesterol esters and lipoproteins in the liver,\nthereby inhibiting the production of triglycerides in the liver\n14.\nMoreover, previous studies have shown that total plasmaglyceride level is not signi \ufb01cantly affected by GAN diet\n13.\nAtherosclerosis is a chronic in \ufb02ammatory disease commonly\nmanifesting as increased circulating pro-in \ufb02ammatory cytokines26.\nIn the present study, GC-treated ApoE\u2212/\u2212mice had signi \ufb01cantlyhigher plasma levels of pro-in \ufb02ammatory cytokines, including TNF-\n\u03b1,I L - 1 \u03b2, and IL-6. IL-1 \u03b2\u2212/\u2212/ApoE\u2212/\u2212mice or TNF- \u03b1\u2212/\u2212/ApoE\u2212/\u2212\nmice have been shown to have lower degree of aortic lesions,\nindicating the importance of IL-1 \u03b2and TNF- \u03b1on aortic lesion\ndevelopment27,28. Additionally, palm oil and high cholesterol can\nenhance the production of IL-1 \u03b2, inducing in \ufb02ammation29.I nt h e\npresent study, GEO and citral treatment exhibited immunomodu-\nlatory activity by reducing plasma IL-1 \u03b2and TNF- \u03b1levels.\nConsuming unhealthy diet is associated with hyperlipidemia,\nchronic in \ufb02ammation, and dysbiosis, which are major causes of\nCVD3. As earlier stated, food nutrients, such as \u029f-carnitine, can be\nmetabolized by speci \ufb01c gut microbiome to form \u03b3BB and TMA22,\nand TMA can be subsequently oxidized to TMAO (the CVD risk\nfactor) by the host hepatic \ufb02avin monooxygenase6. In the present\nstudy, plasma concentrations of carnitine, \u03b3-BB, TMA, and TMAO\nwere signi \ufb01cantly higher in the GC group compared with the\nCON group. In contrast, \u03b3BB was not detected in the CON group,\nindicating that these metabolites are produced by the gut\nmicrobiota using \u029f-carnitine as a substrate. Apart from supple-\nmentation with \u029f-carnitine, high-fat and high-sugar diets have\nbeen shown to signi \ufb01cantly increase plasma TMAO levels in\nmice9,12. A previous study showed that administering \u029f-carnitine\nalone without the HFD increased plasma TMAO level to\n~20 \u00b5M17. Similarly, a combination of GAN diet and \u029f-carnitine\nincreased the plasma TMAO levels of mice to approximately\n50 \u00b5M in the present study. However, GEO and citral treatment\nsigni \ufb01cantly reduced plasma TMA and TMAO levels, indicating\nthat they may possess antibiotic-like activity, suppressing the\nproduction of TMA-related bacteria in the gut. Moreover, GEO\nand citral functioned as anti-in \ufb02ammatory agents to reduce the\nlevels of circulating in \ufb02ammatory markers, thus ameliorating\natherosclerosis.\nA previous study showed the intake of HFD altered gut\nmicrobiota in mice after 2 weeks14. Additionally, obesogenic and\nmetabolic changes, NASH phenotype, altered gut microbiota\ncomposition and function, gut dysbiosis, intestinal leakage, and\nendotoxemia were observed in mice fed a palm oil-containing\nHFD13. In the present study, fecal microbiota \u0251- and \u03b2-diversities\nwere altered in the GC group compared with the CON group.\nSpeci \ufb01cally, there was an increase in CVD-related bacteria,\nincluding Enterorhabdus ,Romboutsia ,Proteus ,Eubacterium noda-\ntum group , and Escherichia-Shigella , and a decrease in the\nabundance of speci \ufb01c bene \ufb01cial microbiomes, such as Bi\ufb01dobac-\nterium and Alistipes . Spearman \u2019s correlation analysis showed that\nEubacterium coprostanoligenes group ,Parasutterella ,Enterohabdus ,\nAkkermansia ,Romboutsia ,Proteus , and Olsenella were positively\ncorrelated with aortic lesions. Additionally, Bi\ufb01dobacterium and\nAlistipes were negatively correlated with aortic lesions, while\nEnterohabdus was positively associated with plasma TMAO levels.\nApoE\u2212/\u2212mice fed HFD have been reported to have a higher\nrelative abundance of Enterorhabdus30. Moreover, Romboutsia is\nmore abundant in patients with normal blood pressure than in\npatients with hypertension31, making Romboutsia an indicator of\nsystolic blood pressure32.Proteus penneri and Escherichia fergusonii\nare well-known CVD-related bacteria that can convert \u029f-carnitine\nto\u03b3BB33. Particularly, the Eubacterium nodatum group and\nEmergencia timonensis can anaerobically metabolize \u03b3-BB to\nTMA22. In contrast, probiotics, such as Bi\ufb01dobacterium breve and\nBi\ufb01dobacterium longum , improves cardiovascular health by mod-\nulating gut microbiota and reducing plasma TMAO level in\ncholine-fed mice34.Alistipes , short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-produ-\ncing bacteria genera, were signi \ufb01cantly enriched in healthy\nvolunteers than in NASH patients, indicating that the bacteria\ncan play a bene \ufb01cial role against liver diseases by secreting SCFA.\nHowever, Alistipes are associated with hypertension35. A combina-\ntion of GAN diet and \u029f-carnitine may negatively affect gut\nmicrobiota composition, resulting in dysbiosis.\nS. Panyod et al.\n6\nnpj Science of Food (2023)    19 Published in partnership with Beijing Technology and Business University\nIn the present study, GEO and citral treatment affected the \u0251-\nand \u03b2-diversities of gut microbiota. Interestingly, GEO treatment\ndecreased the abundance of the CVD-associated bacteria, includ-ingEnterorhabdus and Proteus , but increased the abundance of\nthe bene \ufb01cial bacteria Allobaculum . Additionally, citral treatment\nalso decreased the abundance of Proteus and enriched Allobacu-\nlumand Dubosiella . Moreover, GEO was positively correlated with\nAkkermansia , whereas citral was positively associated with\nAllobaculum and Dubosiella .\nAkkermansia muciniphila prevents atherosclerosis in ApoE\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice by decreasing endotoxemia and in \ufb02ammation36. Addition-\nally, ginger extract increased the relative abundance of Allobacu-\nlum in mice fed HFD; moreover, transplantation with fecal\ncontents from mice fed HFD supplemented with ginger extractincreased the abundance of Allobaculum\n37. Furthermore, the\nabundance of Allobaculum is lower in ApoE\u2212/\u2212mice fed HFD,\nindicating a negative correlation between Allobaculum and\natherosclerosis38. Hypertensive mice had a low abundance of\nDubosiella , which was negatively correlated with CVD39. Previous\nstudies have shown that GEO remodeled gut microbiota and\nreversed dysbiosis to amelioration NASH in a murine model ofNASH; moreover, GEO suppressed the NLRP3 in \ufb02ammasome and\nmediated the gut microbiota-LPS-TLR4 pathway\n20. Collectively,\nGEO and citral treatments improved gut microbiota compositionin the ApoE\n\u2212/\u2212mice. Several foods and herbs have been shown to\nprevent CVD through gut microbiota modulation3. Berberine, a\nnatural alkaloid found in Coptis chinensis and Berberis vulgaris , has\nbeen reported modify gut microbiota composition and function-ality, inhibit TMA and TMAO production, and alleviate athero-sclerosis\n38. Another study found that the intake of raw garlic juice\nfor 2 weeks reduced gut microbiota-host-derived TMAO andincreased the abundance of speci \ufb01c bene \ufb01cial bacteria in humans.\nMoreover, the active component of raw garlic, known as allicin,\nhas been showed to reduce circulating TMA and TMAO levels and\nameliorating atherosclerosis in ApoE\n\u2212/\u2212mice fed carnitine via gut\nmicrobiota modulation17.\nIn summary, the results of this study showed that GEO and citral\nexhibit cardio-protective effects by modulating gut microbiota,inhibiting the formation of TMAO, reducing pro-in \ufb02ammatory\ncytokine levels, and improving insulin resistance (Fig. 5), indicating\nthat GEO and citral may serve as potential dietary supplements forCVD prevention.METHODS\nGEO extraction and analysis of its major componentsGinger ( Zingiber of \ufb01cinale Roscoe) samples were purchased from\nNantou Mingjian Country Farmers Association, Nantou, Taiwan,washed, cut into slices, and blended with three volumes ofdistilled water. GEO was then extracted from the resulting puree\nfor approximately 6 h using steam distillation, yielding a yellowish\nclear essential oil. The concentration of the extract wasapproximately 0.14% (w/w), and the chemical constituent wasanalyzed using Thermo Scienti \ufb01c Focus gas chromatography\nequipped with an AI 3000 II autosampler and a \ufb02ame ionization\ndetector. The analysis program and conditions are as follows: \ufb02ow\nrate of the carrier N\n2gas was 1 mL/min with a split ratio of 40:1;\ninitial column temperature, 50 \u00b0C; \ufb01nal column temperature,\n200 \u00b0C; an increase of 7 \u00b0C/min to 200 \u00b0C held for 0 min; injectortemperature, 250 \u00b0C; detector temperature, 250 \u00b0C; and injectionvolume, 0.3 \u03bcL. Citral (purity > 95%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used\nas a standard. A representative chromatogram is shown inSupplementary Fig. 1. The primary component of GEO was citral,comprised of a mixture of the two geometric isomers, geranial andneral. The retention times of geranial and neral were 17.04 min\nand 17.82 min, respectively, and the area under curve (AUC) was\ncalculated to quantify the amount of both components in GEO.Citral accounted for approximately 31% (neral: 18.8% and geranial:12.2%) of constituents of GEO, which was consistent with previous\ufb01ndings (30%)\n19.\nAnimal model\nApoE\u2212/\u2212mice were originally purchased from the Jackson\nLaboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in the animal house ofInstitute of Food Science and Technology, National Taiwan\nUniversity. The animals were handled according to the guidelines\nestablished by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ofNational Taiwan University (Approval No: NTU-109-EL-00131).Eight-week-old C57BL/6 ApoE\n\u2212/\u2212female mice were housed in a\nroom at 22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C under a 12 h light/dark cycle. Compared withmale ApoE\n\u2212/\u2212mice, female ApoE\u2212/\u2212mice exhibited pronounced\n\ufb02avin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) activity and signi \ufb01cantly elevated\nplasma TMAO levels; hence, the female mice were selected for this\nstudy40. After adaptation for 2 weeks, the mice were randomly\ndivided into \ufb01ve groups with eight mice in each: (1) CON (control\ndiet); (2) GC (GAN diet +1.3% \u029f-carnitine in drinking water);\nFig. 5 GEO and citral prevents cardiovascular disease and ameliorates atherosclerosis through gut microbiota and TMAO modulation.\nGEO and citral (1) protected ApoE\u2212/\u2212mice from GC-induced atherosclerosis and improved plasma lipidemic biomarker HDL-C; (2) enhanced\nglucose and insulin homeostasis, ameliorated hepatic damage, and reduced plasma levels of pro-in \ufb02ammatory cytokine IL-1 \u03b2; (3) remodeled\ngut microbiota and downregulated meta-organismal metabolism of the \u029f-carnitine-TMAO pathway; and (4) favorably modulated the gut\nmicrobiota.

GEO and citral were dissolved in soybean oil.\nMice in the CON and GC groups were also given soybean oil via\noral gavage method, and the dosage of GEO and citral and thecomposition of citral as neral in GEO used in this study was based\non previous studies\n19. All mice were fed the experimental diets\nand liquid ad libitum. After 16 weeks, the mice were sacri \ufb01ced\nusing carbon dioxide asphyxiation and blood was collected bycardiac puncture using a syringe.\nOil red O staining of the aorta\nAorta samples collected from the mice were rinsed with\nphosphate-buffered saline to clean residual blood and dissected\nunder the microscope using a micro-scissor and tweezers to\nremove the fatty tissues. The dissected sample was \ufb01xed in 10%\nformalin overnight, washed with distilled water for 5 min, soaked\ntwice in propylene glycol for 5 min, stained with oil red O for\napproximately 10 min, soaked in 85% propylene glycol for 3 min,and washed again with distilled water for 3 min. Images of thestained aorta were captured under a microscope and aortic lesions\nwere quanti \ufb01ed using Image J software (Version 1.8.0)\n17.\nPlasma biochemical analysis\nBlood samples from the mice were centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 gfor\n15 min (4 \u00b0C) to extract plasma. The total cholesterol, totaltriglyceride, HDL-C, glucose, AST, and ALT contents of the plasmasamples were determined using commercial test strips in an\nautomatic blood analyzer (SpotchemTM II reagent strip; Arkray\nInc., Kyoto, Japan)\n17.

The \ufb01nal ampli \ufb01ed products were subsequently\nvisualized using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Library sequen-cing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform, according tomanufacturer \u2019s instructions. The raw sequences were processed\naccording to the QIIME2 pipeline, and the amplicon sequencevariant (ASV) table was prepared according to the SILVA database(version 132). \u03b1-diversity, including observed species and Shannon\ndiversity index, was calculated using the vegan package in Rsoftware. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performedbased on Bray-Curtis distance. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) wasperformed to determine the heterogeneity of the fecal microbiota\namong all groups.
