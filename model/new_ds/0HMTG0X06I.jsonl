Is therapy still mainly symptomatic or does the pill against arthrosis\nalready exist? Causal and non-causal, as well as future therapeutic approaches, are discussed. Various\nsurgical and non-surgical treatment options are available that can help manage symptoms, slow down\nprogression, and improve quality of life. To date, however, therapy is still mainly symptomatic, often\nusing painkilling and anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs until the \ufb01nal stage, which is usually joint replacement.\nThese \u201csymptomatic pills against\u201d have side effects and do not alter the progression of OA, which\nis caused by an imbalance between degenerative and regenerative processes. Next to resolving\nmechanical issues, the goal must be to gain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis\nof OA. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in cartilage-regenerative medicine and in the current\nstyle of treating rheumatoid arthritis, where drug therapy (\u201cthe pill against\u201d) has been established to\nslow down or even stop the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and has banned the vast majority of\nformer almost regular severe joint destructions. However, the \u201ccausal pill against\u201d OA does not exist\nso far. First, the early detection of osteoarthritis by means of biomarkers and imaging should therefore\ngain more focus. Second, future therapeutic approaches have to identify innovative therapeutic\napproaches in\ufb02uencing in\ufb02ammatory and metabolic processes. Several pharmacologic, genetic, and\neven epigenetic attempts are promising, but none have clinically improved causal therapy so far,\nunfortunately.\nKeywords: osteoarthritis; cartilage; chondroprotectors; platelet rich plasma; NSAIDs; mesenchymal\nstem cells\n1. Introduction\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a disease with a degenerative and in\ufb02ammatory component that\naffects a large proportion of the ageing population [ 1]. The joints of the lower extremities are\nparticularly affected, especially the hip and knee. Cartilage loss is the most visible change,\nbut all joint structures are affected, some occurring quite a bit earlier than cartilage, such\nas the synovia or subchondral bone. OA involves a variety of factors, such as mechanical\nloading, ageing, in\ufb02ammation, and metabolic changes, and the activation of different\nsignaling pathways and enzymatic processes, ultimately leading to a progressive loss of\njoint function. Consequently, osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous disease with a common\nend route but many different starting points. Accordingly, there are diverse treatment\nmodalities. They can either be conservative such as thermal, pharmacological, orthotic\nor physiotherapeutic, or surgical. The latter can be reconstructive, such as in cartilage\nstimulation or cartilage transplantation, load allocating, such as in osteotomies, or \ufb01nally\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023 ,13, 1087. https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm13071087 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jpm\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023 ,13, 1087 2 of 12\nreplacing, such as in terms of arti\ufb01cial joint replacement. However, especially in the early\nstages, the therapeutic approach often remains purely symptomatic. Currently, there is\nno causal drug for the treatment of OA. The most common treatment form is the use of\npainkilling and anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs until the \ufb01nal stage of treatment, which is usually\njoint replacement. However, the actual cause of OA is often not being treated. Another\nrecent narrative review summarized the guidelines and symptomatic pharmacotherapeutic\ntreatments [2].\nThe current review\u2019s aim is to describe future perspectives. In recent years, the patho-\ngenesis of osteoarthritis has become increasingly well understood, and new therapeutic\napproaches are emerging. There are clear similarities to rheumatoid arthritis, which led to a\nlarge number of rapid and severe joint destructions several decades ago. Today, those cases\nare rare due to new medical approaches, mainly the so-called biologicals [ 3]. The goal is to\nimplement causal therapy and to abandon singular symptomatic therapy in OA as well.\nBy in\ufb02uencing the underlying signaling pathways of OA or by using stem cells, attempts\nhave been made to prevent the destruction of cartilage or to reduce the pain-triggering\nin\ufb02ammatory reaction. The development of OA pharmacotherapies is primarily focused\non the protection or even the regeneration of cartilage tissue, led by the assumption that the\nprotection of cartilage structure also in\ufb02uences the clinical symptoms. Contradictorily, an\nMRI-based study has shown that a loss of cartilage thickness is associated with only a small\namount of worsening knee pain, an association mediated in part by worsening synovitis [ 4].\nPossible therapeutic approaches are, therefore, in addition to chondroprotection, the causal\ntreatment of synovitis.\nThe aim of this narrative review is to summarize the current pharmacotherapeutic\ntreatment options for OA therapy beyond the solely symptomatic attempts. Causal and\nnon-causal, as well as future, therapeutic approaches are discussed below. This review\nattempts to think outside the box by also mentioning the approaches in the \ufb01eld of gene\ntherapy and epigenetics. OA therapies that are not drug therapies are not addressed in\nthis review. Lifestyle modi\ufb01cations, such as a change in eating habits and dietary weight\nmanagement, as well as activity, physiotherapy, and mechanical issues also play a large\npart in successful therapy. A claim to the completeness of all possible therapy alternatives\nfor OA can therefore not be made. The question addressed here is whether OA therapy\nwill remain mainly symptomatic or if the pill against arthrosis already exists?\n2. Symptomatic OA Therapy\n2.1. Pain Killers\nThe most common therapy for OA is still the use of painkillers. In principle, there are\ndifferent classes of substances available. These drugs are a purely symptomatic therapy\nthat can alleviate but cannot in\ufb02uence the progression of OA. As this topic has been well\ndescribed in several guidelines and in a recent narrative review [ 2], just a short summary\nof the most used painkillers will be presented in the following.\nNonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used and pre-\nscribed pain medications in the treatment of OA and are routinely recommended in clinical\npractice guidelines [ 5]. Pain management is an essential part of OA treatment. In\ufb02ammation\noccurs in all joint tissues and is thus an essential target of drug therapy. In\ufb02ammation leads\nto the release of various neuromodulatory mediators such as cytokines and prostaglandins\nwhich are synthesized by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). The release of proin\ufb02amma-\ntory mediators leads to the classic symptoms of synovitis, joint swelling and hyperthermia.\nFurthermore, in\ufb02ammation can induce joint tissue damage [6\u20138].\nNSAIDs can counteract these processes by reducing the corresponding in\ufb02ammatory\ncascades by inhibiting the COX enzyme. Additionally, NSAIDs can reduce the sensation of\npain relief by desensitizing nociceptors and are thus effective drugs in the symptomatic\ntherapy of OA [ 9]. Smith et al. and Stewart et al. report in their meta-analysis that oral\nNSAIDs are similarly effective as opioids in relieving pain in patients with OA [ 10,11].\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023 ,13, 1087 3 of 12\nHowever, the use of NSAIDS is limited due to their known but rare risk of gastrointestinal,\ncardiovascular, and renal adverse events [12].\nStudies have concluded that the oral use of NSAIDs is mainly recommended for short-\nterm or intermittent therapy, rather than prolonged treatment [ 13]. Osani et al. reported in\ntheir meta-analysis that the therapeutic peak of NSAID-induced bene\ufb01ts in patients with\nknee OA was reached after 2 weeks and decreased over time, while cardiovascular and\ngastrointestinal side effects were already signi\ufb01cantly increased after 4 weeks of treatment.\nThe usage of selective COX-2 inhibitors has increased in the past decades, due to their\nbene\ufb01t of combining both anti-in\ufb02ammatory and analgesic properties, while providing\nbetter gastrointestinal tolerability and a reduction in gastroduodenal ulcers in comparison\nwith non-selective COX inhibitors [14].\nCoxibs, however, have been associated with an increase in cardiovascular events\ndue to a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis [ 15]. On the contrary, in a meta-analysis\nconducted by Cooper et al., recent data has shown that celecoxib does not signi\ufb01cantly\nincrease cardiovascular risk when compared with conventional NSAIDs and placebos,\nregardless of the dose and the duration of treatment [ 16]. However, recommendations on\nthe analgesic use of various NSAIDs for patients with underlying health conditions remain\ncon\ufb02icting. When prescribing any type of NSAIDs, all risk factors (age, gastrointestinal,\ncardiovascular, and renal events) should be taken into account. Due to adverse effects,\nNSAIDs are not intended for long term treatment.\nA simple and effective way to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is the\ntopical application of NSAIDs. Amemiya et al. compared the effects of es\ufb02urbiprofen\npatches versus \ufb02urbiprofen tablets in patients with gonarthrosis in 2021. Maximum es\ufb02ur-\nbiprofen concentrations were observed in the synovium, synovial \ufb02uids, and plasma after\nes\ufb02urbiprofen plaster (SFPP) application for 12 h. The numeric rating scale (NRS) results\nindicated a long-lasting effect of SFPP . Through transdermal application, a continuously\nhigh drug effect level was achieved. Overall, no dose peaks need to be accepted to achieve\nthe same effect as with repeated daily oral administration [17].\nDepending on the risk pro\ufb01le and the patient\u2019s pain perception, it must be decided on\na case-by-case basis whether oral or topical application is preferable.\nOpioids are an alternative for more severe pain states when usual pain medication or\nother pain treatments are not suf\ufb01cient or may not be used. In a direct comparison with\nNSAIDs, tramadol was inferior in terms of analgesia [ 18]. When prescribing opioids, the\nside effect pro\ufb01le, such as central nervous effects with fatigue, dizziness, and impaired\nbalance, should be taken into account. This is where opioids differ adversely from NSAIDs.\nOpioids such as tramadol should not be prescribed as a \ufb01rst-line therapy. If other drugs\nare not used due to their side effect pro\ufb01le or if a non-drug therapy (e.g., surgery) is not\ncurrently available, they should be used. Opioids are not used long-term or routinely for\nosteoarthritis. However, they may be indicated for short-term therapy [2].\n2.2. Symptomatic OA Therapy with Potentially Causal Impact\n2.2.1. Hyaluronic Acid (Intra-Articular)\nHyaluronic acid (HA) is reduced in both concentration and molecular size in patients\nwith osteoarthritis; hence, the intra-articular injection of HA aims to substitute the phys-\niological synovial HA. The individual hyaluronic acid (HA) products differ in terms of\nproduction, molecular weight, degree of cross-linking, viscosity, and frequency of applica-\ntion per series. Despite a large number of scienti\ufb01c studies, the effectiveness of this therapy\nis still disputed in the literature. While some meta-analyses show tangible bene\ufb01ts, they\noften include studies with a high risk of bias. When meta-analyses are restricted to studies\nwith a low risk of bias, the effect of IAHA is similar to that of saline injections [ 2,19]. There\nis a growing amount of literature demonstrating that product differences, particularly\nHA molecular weight, may have a signi\ufb01cant effect on treatment outcomes, with a higher\nmolecular weight showing better results [ 19]. Due to the invasive mode of application,\nthe indication for intra-articular HA injection should, however, only be made when the\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023 ,13, 1087 4 of 12\nprescription of NSAIDs is not possible due to side effects or contraindications or when these\nare not suf\ufb01ciently effective. The possible side effects such as joint infection or irritation\nof the knee joint must be discussed with the patient in advance; severe adverse events\nare rare.\n2.2.2. Corticosteroids (Intra-Articular)\nThe intra-articular injection of a glucocorticoid for the relief of the acute in\ufb02ammatory\nsymptoms of activated arthrosis can be a useful measure. The aim of the treatment is to\nreduce pain and restore mobility. Randomised and placebo-controlled studies have shown\nthat the intra-articular injection of a glucocorticoid into an osteoarthritic knee joint can\nsigni\ufb01cantly reduce symptoms over a period of at least 1 week. Occasionally, however,\na prolonged effect lasting 16\u201324 weeks is observed after the intra-articular application of\nglucocorticoids [ 20]. They should be used in the short term at the lowest possible but\neffective dosage for painful arthrosis that does not respond to other therapeutic measures.\nThis may be the case, for example, in in\ufb02amed arthrosis with acute pain exacerbation.\nThere is a lack of data on the long-term effects of cortisone injections on articular\ncartilage and on a possible association with adverse joint effects. However, in some in vivo\nstudies, corticosteroids were found to be cytotoxic to articular cartilage [ 21]. In a 2-year\nrandomised trial, the cortisone-in\ufb01ltration group showed higher cartilage loss than the\nsaline-injection group. Taken together, cortisone injections are still a common treatment\noption, but they are not without side effects. Frequent use must therefore be considered\ncritically [ 22]. Injections at too short intervals increase the risk of infection. The patient\nshould be informed about the possible complications of infection and/or tissue atrophy as\nwell as about possible treatment alternatives.\n2.2.3. Platelet-Rich Plasma (Intra-Articular)\nAside from the available oral drugs against OA, the usage of autologous growth\nfactors, e.g., intra-articular injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), can be used for OA\ntreatment, especially for knee OA. The autologous \ufb02uid, which is obtained by centrifuging\nwhole blood, is a highly concentrated cocktail of in\ufb02ammatory mediators and growth\nfactors capable of reducing in\ufb02ammatory distress and stimulating cell proliferation and\ncartilaginous matrix production [ 16]. Between 2011 and 2021, 867 studies on the topic of\nPRP were published, with an upward trend over the years [23].\nMultiple studies have con\ufb01rmed effective pain relief and the improvement of physical\nfunction after PRP injections as well as an acceptable safety pro\ufb01le [24,25].\nPRP injections also showed stronger effects compared with conventional injections\nwith corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid [ 24]. Furthermore, regular injections of intra-\narticular corticosteroid can lead to the loss of cartilage structure and thus more rapid\ndisease progression.\nConsequently, PRP injections may not only contribute to pain relief through anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory effects but can also provide lasting pain relief and functional restoration\nthrough targeted structural reconstruction when used over an extended period of time.\nIt was shown that PRP injections significantly improved physical function and WOMAC\nscores at 3, and up to 12, months [24].\nPatients undergoing treatment with PRP injections experience both pain relief and\nimproved joint function. However, it remains unclear whether the short-term effect of\nPRP injection is due to the temporary changes in the joint environment or whether PRP\ninjections actually lead to structural changes, thus preventing the progression of OA.\nAnother unresolved question surrounds which components of PRP cause this effect. In\nparticular, the proportion of leukocytes (leukocyte-rich or leukocyte-poor) is still the subject\nof research. The \ufb01rst positive results have been achieved with leukocyte-poor plasma [ 26].\nIn summary, the use of PRP is showing very encouraging preliminary results; however, its\nuse is not yet recommended as \ufb01rst-line-therapy in the guidelines.\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023 ,13, 1087 5 of 12\n2.2.4. Chondroitin and Glucosamine\nChondroitin and glucosamine have chondroprotective, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory\neffects. They are symptomatic, slow-acting drugs used against osteoarthritis. Glucosamine\nis a component of glycosaminoglycans and can be found in high amounts in articular\ncartilage and synovial \ufb02uid. Chondroitin is found in the extracellular matrix of articular\ncartilage and plays a role in maintaining osmotic pressure. Thus, it could improve elasticity\nand the resistance of cartilage [ 27]. Both chondroitin and glucosamine seem to develop\ntheir effects\u2014partly in different forms\u2014through the use of many different pathways.\nHowever, only a few selected ones will be mentioned below. Glucosamine was shown\nto decrease the levels of proin\ufb02ammatory interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor\nnecrosis factor- \u000b(TNF- \u000b), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in studies with rats. In contrast, the\nanti-in\ufb02ammatory interleukins IL-2 and IL-10 were increased [ 28\u201330]. Glucosamine also\nappears to have immunomodulatory effects that affect the activity of phospholipase A2,\nmatrix metalloproteinases, or aggrecans [ 31]. Moreover, chondroitin and glucosamine block\nthe pathways involved in in\ufb02ammation in osteoarthritis, such as the mitogen-activated\nprotein kinase (MAPK) pathway [ 32]. In addition, both chondroitin and glucosamine have\nantioxidant effects [33].\nIn a meta-analysis by Zhu et al. from 2018, it was shown that chondroitin\u2014via oral\nadministration\u2014signi\ufb01cantly alleviates pain and leads to an improvement in physical func-\ntion compared with a placebo. Glucosamine, on the other hand, may improve stiffness [ 34].\nA combination of glucosamine and chondroitin appears to provide better pain relief than ac-\netaminophen in hip and knee OA, but celecoxib showed the best results in this study [ 35]. It\nwas found that both chondroitin alone and glucosamine alone could signi\ufb01cantly reduce the\ndecrease in joint space. Moreover, intraarticular injections of hyaluronic acid in combination\nwith glucosamine hydrochloride led to a signi\ufb01cantly higher reduction in IL-6, IL-1 \f, and\nTGF-\fcompared with hyaluronic acid alone in patients with temporomandibular OA [ 36].\nKwoh et al. and Fransen et al. failed to demonstrate any changes in joint structure\nwith chondroitin or glucosamine administration in patients with chronic knee pain in\nOA[37,38] . Another meta-analysis summarized seventeen studies, of which only seven\nstudies demonstrated a statistically signi\ufb01cant reduction in pain and four studies demon-\nstrated a reduction in joint space narrowing [39].\nSeveral smaller dosages of glucosamine throughout the day appear to be more effective\nthan one large dose per day [40].\nTaken together, chondroitin and glucosamine seem to have an effect on the milder\nforms of OA, reducing joint in\ufb02ammation and pain. The administration is safe and shows\nonly a small number of adverse effects, such as headache or nausea. Overall, however,\nthere are con\ufb02icting results regarding their clinical ef\ufb01cacy. Thus, in patients with con-\ntraindications to NSAIDs or with an increased risk of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular\nrisks, the use of oral glucosamine and chondroitin may be considered as a treatment trial\nbefore more invasive therapies are undertaken.\n2.2.5. Collagen\nCollagen is a protein of the extracellular matrix that occurs mainly as collagen type II\nin the articular cartilage. The enteral absorption of undenatured type II collagen is very low,\nbut di- or tripeptides containing the amino acids proline or hydroxyproline can be absorbed\nand show an effect [ 41]. Hydrolyzed collagen could contribute to cartilage regeneration\nby increasing the synthesis of macromolecules in the extracellular matrix [ 42]. In addition,\ncollagen is able to modulate both humoral and cellular components of the immune sys-\ntem. It contributes to the body\u2019s ability to distinguish between harmless molecules and\npotentially harmful pathogens [ 43]. This leads, for example, to the transformation of naive\nT cells into T regulatory cells that produce anti-in\ufb02ammatory substances such as TGF- \f\nand IL-10 [ 44]. Proline and hydroxyproline can induce hyaluronic acid synthesis [ 45] and\nthe chondrocytes to synthesize glycosaminoglycans [46].\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023 ,13, 1087 6 of 12\nPain in patients with hip and knee OA can be alleviated using an oral supplementation\nof collagen. WOMAC scores, VAS scores, and quality of life improve signi\ufb01cantly compared\nwith a placebo [ 47]. Trc et al. compared a supplementation of hydrolyzed collagen and glu-\ncosamine sulphate for 90 days, respectively. The supplementation of hydrolyzed collagen\nled to a statistically signi\ufb01cant improvement in WOMAC and VAS scores compared with\nglucosamine sulphate [48].\nJoint conditions seem to improve following the administration of collagen. It may\ninduce cartilage repair to maintain structure and function. The clinical use of collagen is\nsafe and has minimal adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal. However, further studies\nare needed to show the bene\ufb01ts in the treatment of patients with OA and to determine the\noptimal dosage and duration.\n3. Causal OA Therapy\n3.1. Monoclonal Antibodies\nOver the last few decades, monoclonal antibodies have emerged as a revolutionary\ntool in the \ufb01eld of medicine with many promising clinical applications. One of the biggest\nadvantages of monoclonal antibodies is their high speci\ufb01city as they are designed to target\nmolecules in the body such as cytokines, growth factors, and receptors. In the context of\nosteoarthritis, antibodies revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Currently,\ndrug therapy (\u201cthe pill against\u201d) has been established to slow down or even stop the\nprogression of the autoimmune disease and has caused the end of the vast majority of\nformerly regular severe joint destructions. Although the effects and goals of treatment\nare partly comparable to OA, they are not established as standard therapy. The question\narises, will this change? Up to now, there have been some approaches that use monoclonal\nantibodies in pain therapy of OA, some of which will be presented in the following.\n3.1.1. TNF and IL-1 Inhibitors\nIn one randomized controlled trial, patients with erosive hand OA were treated\nwith the anti-TNF antibody adalimumab (subcutaneous administration once a week) or a\nplacebo for 12 weeks each. Pain intensity was measured with the VAS score. There was no\nsigni\ufb01cant difference [ 49]. Another anti-TNF antibody (etanercept) failed to demonstrate\nany bene\ufb01t in a treatment duration of 24 weeks compared with a placebo in hand OA [ 50].\nCanakinumab is an IL-1 inhibitor that showed a reduced rate of joint arthroplasties in\npatients with atherosclerotic disease [ 51]. However, further studies failed to show any\nbene\ufb01ts with respect to pain alleviation in patients with OA when IL-1 was blocked [ 52].\nOverall, TNF and IL-1 inhibitors seem to be rather unsuitable for patients with OA.\n3.1.2. Anti-NGF\nJoint tissues have been innervated using nociceptors, except for cartilage. Nerve\ngrowth factor is an important neurotrophin in in\ufb02amed synovium. It is upregulated in\npatients with OA and leads to an increase in pain. There are three different monoclonal\nantibodies used in therapy: Tanezumab, Ulranumab, and Fasinumab. They lead to impres-\nsive pain relief in patients with knee and hip OA but accelerate the progression of OA [ 53].\nThe administration of fewer doses showed a reduced but still substantial effect on pain and\nfunction. Nevertheless, 3% of the patients suffered from progressive OA [ 54]. There are a\nfew other adverse effects such as peripheral neuropathies, headaches, upper respiratory\ntract infections, oedema, or joint pain [ 55]. NGF seems to be a relevant factor for cartilage\nintegrity or the repair of cartilage, so that a complete blockade is not an effective treatment\nin patients with OA. Anti-NGF treatment is promising, but studies are needed to \ufb01nd the\noptimal dosage to alleviate pain and reduce the adverse effects.\n3.2. Stem Cell Treatments\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as a speci\ufb01c type of adult stem cell, possess great\npotential in regenerative therapy due to their capacity for self-renewal and differentia-\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023 ,13, 1087 7 of 12\ntion [ 56]. Great attention has been paid to cell-based therapy that may in\ufb02uence cartilage\nrepair such as mesenchymal stem cell therapy. Most studies have been conducted in the\ncontext of knee joint osteoarthritis. MSCs are primarily used as intra-articular injection\ntherapy. MSCs modulate immune or in\ufb02ammatory effects and tissue regeneration in knee\nosteoarthritis [ 57,58]. The exact mechanism of MSC therapy remains unclear. It is known\nthat cartilage repair and protection against OA-induced cartilage degeneration is promoted\nby MSC-derived extracellular vesicles.\nInjected MSCs are expected to repair damaged issues due to the trilineage potential\nand immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. MSCs can be harvested from different sites.\nThe best known or most accessible sites are bone marrow or fat tissue. Other sources include\nmuscle tissue, synovial membranes, or placenta. In addition, the cells can be obtained\neither from autogenic or allogenic sources. The advantage of allogenic stem cells is that\nthey can be harvested from healthy donors and expanded in vitro to obtain a clinically\nrelevant amount for injection. The disadvantage of allogeneic cell collection is a possible\nreaction of the recipient\u2019s immune system after injection [59].\nStudies in humans have reported variable structural outcomes after MSC injection\nfrom hyaline-like cartilage to \ufb01brous tissue. A meta-analysis including 582 knee-OA-\npatients in 11 trials was performed to assess the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of MSC treatment for\nknee OA patients using VAS, IKDC, WOMAC, Lequesne, Lysholm, and Tegner scores. MSC-\ntreatment groups from the identi\ufb01ed trials were compared with their respective control\ngroups. It shows that VAS decreases and IKDC increases signi\ufb01cantly after 24 months\nfollow up. MSC therapy also showed signi\ufb01cant decreases in WOMAC and Lequesne\nscores after the 12-month follow up. The evaluation of Lysholm (24-month) and Tegner\n(12- and 24-month) scores also demonstrated favorable results for MSC treatment. The\neffects of MSC therapy on short-term primary endpoints still need to be evaluated in a\nlarger number of patients [60].\nAnother important question is the dosage at which the stem cells should be injected.\nA larger amount of injected MSCs may be expected to induce better effects. Interestingly,\nin studies with allogeneic stem cells, it was found that no improvement was observed in\nrelation to \u201chigh dose\u201d as opposed to \u201clow dose\u201d stem cell transplantation. The clinical\nsymptoms and MRI imaging of the cartilage were the main factors assessed. There were\nalso differences in the dose effect of stem cells depending on their origin. These results\nsuggest that appropriate MSC doses applied in intra-articular injections to OA patients need\nto be determined for each origin of MSCs [ 61,62]. Furthermore, MSC injection combined\nwith other agents such as hyaluronic acid [ 63] or PRP [ 64] has better therapeutic effects\nthan MSC injection alone. This implies the possible value of drug cocktail therapy when\nusing MSC injection in knee OA patients.\nOverall, MSC transplantation treatment was shown to be safe and has great potential\nas an ef\ufb01cacious clinical therapy, especially for patients with knee OA. Further clinical\nand in vitro studies are needed to better clarify the underlying molecular and biochemical\nmechanisms. Particularly, it is yet to be determined whether MSCs should be injected\nas a single agent or in combination with another drug or as a complementary therapy to\nsurgical treatment.\n4. Future Directions\n4.1. Gene Therapy\nGene therapy consists of using a vector to bring genes directly into cells and tissues\nto treat a speci\ufb01c disease. Viral vectors include RNA viruses and DNA viruses. Two\ndifferent gene therapy strategies are currently in preclinical and clinical development for\nOA [ 65]. The \ufb01rst approach consists of ex vivo modifying and amplifying cells, followed\nby their intra-articular injection. The aim is to over-express TGF-\u00df-1 in irradiated allogenic\nchondrocytes [ 66]. The second approach is an in vivo gene therapy through the local or\nsystemic injection of viral vectors containing the transgene of interest. In general, OA gene\ntherapy aims to reduce in\ufb02ammation through overexpressing transgenes such as IL-1Ra or\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023 ,13, 1087 8 of 12\na soluble TNF receptor [ 67]. In the future, gene therapy could become a strategy to regulate\nthe intra-articular expression of therapeutic targets in OA.\n4.2. Epigenetics\nEpigenetics is a \ufb01eld of research that analyzes the changes in gene expression or cell\nphenotype occurring without the modi\ufb01cation of the DNA sequence. Several epigenetic\nregulators appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of OA. The epigenetic pro\ufb01ling of\narticular chondrocytes has revealed the existence of an activating sequence that is present\nin billions of people with a risk locus (GDF5-UQCC1) that is involved in OA progression.\nThese epigenetic modi\ufb01cations can also suppress the expression of protective genes in\nOA [ 61]. Abnormal changes in DNA methylation occur in the promoter regions of related\ngenes and signaling pathways in OA chondrocytes. Epigenetic regulation typically in-\nvolves DNA methylation, histone modi\ufb01cation, and noncoding RNA-mediated regulation.\nEpigenetic mechanisms can control several signaling pathways simultaneously. For this\nreason, epigenetic modi\ufb01cations have been considered a potential therapeutic target to\nmanage OA [68].\n5. Conclusions\nOA is caused by an imbalance between degenerative and regenerative processes. To\ndate, therapy is still mainly symptomatic. As well as improving mechanical issues, the\nfuture therapeutic goal must be to gain an even better understanding of the cellular and\nmolecular causes of OA. Non-surgical therapy comprises basic measures such as weight\nreduction, exercise therapy (water and land), and health education. Speci\ufb01c measures com-\nprise biomechanical interventions, physiotherapy, physical measures, and drug therapy.\nSeveral pharmacologic, genetic, and even epigenetic attempts are promising, but unfortu-\nnately, so far none have proven causal therapy to work or cure OA. The early detection of\nosteoarthritis by means of biomarkers and imaging must also gain focus to allow for early\nand targeted treatment.\nWith regards to drug therapy, the individual risk pro\ufb01le as well as the level of suffering\nor pain intensity must be taken into account before treatment is started. For this reason, it\nis not possible to give general advice on drug therapy for OA. A non-causal but proven\ntreatment option for OA is the use of painkillers (mainly NSAIDs), which are beyond the\nfocus of this review. Their duration of therapy is limited due to side effects, especially in\npatients with corresponding underlying diseases. They are solely symptomatic, therefore\nalleviate but do not alter the progression of OA. The use of PRP injections seems to clearly\novercome hyaluronic acid which has recently shown con\ufb02icting results. PRP can potentially\nstimulate cell proliferation and cartilaginous matrix production and provide lasting pain\nrelief and functional restoration through targeted structural reconstruction when used\nover an extended period of time. Therapies with chondroprotective substances such as\nchondroitin, glucosamine, collagen, or monoclonal antibodies lead to a reduction in pain.\nHowever, a signi\ufb01cant therapeutic effect in singular application has not been detected so far.\nThe use of stem cells in arthrosis therapy, however, is a promising therapy. Its possibility\nfor cell regeneration or conversion into functional cells holds great potential, especially\nin the context of the therapy of degenerative diseases such as OA. Favored cell sources,\ndosage, and therapy duration remain unclear.\nDue to the multifactorial genesis of OA, most therapeutic approaches are still symp-\ntomatic and the \u201ccausal pill against\u201d OA does not yet exist. Future therapeutic approaches\nhave to identify innovative therapeutic targets aimed at in\ufb02uencing the in\ufb02ammatory and\nmetabolic processes underlying the pathogenesis and progression of OA.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.B. and F.W.; methodology, J.B. and F.W.; software, F.W.;\nvalidation, J.B. and F.W.; formal analysis, J.B. and F.W.; investigation, J.B. and F.W.; resources, J.B. and\nF.W.; data curation, F.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.W., P .B., A.-M.B., and C.B.; writing\u2014\nreview and editing, J.B. and F.W.; visualization, J.R.; supervision, J.B. and F.W.; project administration,\nJ.
