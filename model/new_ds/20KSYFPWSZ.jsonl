Patients receiving Mg \ninfusion (Mg group) received an intravenous 2-g bolus of Mg at anesthesia induction, followed by infusion of 1 g/h \nuntil procedure end. Outcomes were compared with patients who underwent similar procedures during this time -\nframe without Mg (Control). Endpoints were use of anticholinergic (AC) and belladonna and opium suppositories \n(BO), maximum pain score, and morphine milligram equivalents (MME) in PACU.\nResults There were 182 patients, with 89 (48.9%) patients in the Mg group and 93 (51.1%) in the Control. Signifi-\ncantly, fewer patients in the Mg group were given AC/BO in PACU (9.0% vs. 21.7%, p = 0.02), with odds of using AC/\nBO which was 0.36 (95% CI 0.14, 0.83). No differences were found in pain score (p = 0.62) or MME administration (p \n= 0.94). In subgroup univariate analysis, only those who underwent bladder procedures had a significant difference \nin use of AC/BO (9.5% vs. 30.2%; p = 0.02). Across all surgeries, Mg infusion was associated with decreased use of AC/\nBO in the PACU (OR 0.34, p = 0.02); however, stratifying by procedure type did not find a difference in AC/BO use \npostoperatively.\nConclusion Intravenous infusion of magnesium was found to decrease use of AC/BO in the PACU; however, this \nsignificance was lost after multivariable analysis stratifying by procedure type.\nKeywords  Postoperative pain, Bladder spasm, Anticholinergic, Opioid reduction\nBackground\nPostoperative pain control can be challenging after \ncommon urologic procedures. There is an impetus to \ndecrease postoperative opioid prescribe in urology, as \ncontinued use and diversion of unused pills prescribed \nby surgeons have contributed to the current opioid epi -\ndemic (Carnes et\u00a0 al. 2022; Robles et\u00a0 al. n.d.; Shah et\u00a0 al. \n2017; Ellis et\u00a0al. 2021; Serna et\u00a0al. 2020). Multimodal pain \nmanagement is helpful to limit perioperative narcotic \nusage, with options including nonsteroidal anti-inflam -\nmatory agents, nerve blocks using local anesthetics, and *Correspondence:\nDaniel Salevitz\nSalevitz.daniel@mayo.edu\n1 Department of Urology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Mayo Clinic Phoenix, \nPhoenix, AZ 85054, USA\n2 Flagstaff Surgical Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA\n3 Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, \nScottsdale, AZ, USA\n4 Department of Anesthesiology, Mayo Clinic Phoenix, Phoenix, AZ, USA\nPage 2 of 6 Salevitz\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In that context, this study aims to evaluate the use \nof magnesium in common urologic surgeries including \nrobot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), transure -\nthral bladder surgery, and endoscopic procedures of the \nprostate and urethra. We hypothesize that intraoperative \ninfusion of magnesium sulfate will help to reduce post -\noperative discomfort associated with detrusor overac -\ntivity and reduce administration of AC/BO and opioid \nmedications in the PACU after these common urologic \nprocedures.\nMethods\nWe performed an IRB-exempt retrospective review of \npatients undergoing RARP and endoscopic procedures \nof the bladder, prostate, and urethra from February 2021 \nto December 2021. Starting in February 2021, author L. \nM. partnered with several urologic surgeons at our insti -\ntution to adopt the intraoperative magnesium infusion \nprotocol as follows: an intravenous 2-g bolus of mag -\nnesium sulfate (Mg) administered at time of anesthesia \ninduction, followed by an infusion of 1 g/h until the end \nof the case. Patients who underwent anesthesia with L. \nM. were included in the study who were over 18 years \nold and were undergoing procedures with the surgeons \nwho elected to participate in the protocol. Patients who \nreceived this infusion (Mg group) were compared with \npatients who underwent similar procedures during this \ntimeframe but did not receive the Mg infusion (Con -\ntrol). The groups were further split into procedure type to compare outcomes in patients undergoing RARP , tran -\nsurethral bladder surgery, and endoscopic procedures of \nthe prostate and urethra.\nPostanesthesia care unit (PACU) nursing staff recorded \npostoperative pain scores and administered analgesic \nmedications as ordered by anesthesia and urology teams. \nStandardized order sets were used and included anticho -\nlinergic and narcotic medications for pain control in both \nthe Mg and Control patients. Intravesical gemcitabine in \nthe PACU was instilled after bladder tumor resection to \nprevent tumor recurrence and progression (Gontero and \nFrea 2006), which was ordered per provider discretion \naccording to the patient\u2019s clinical history. This chemo -\ntherapy administration was recorded, as side effects can \ninclude irritative urinary symptoms.\nThe endpoints of interest were AC or BO use, maxi -\nmum pain score, and morphine milligram equivalents \n(MME) in the PACU. Univariate testing was performed \nto determine differences in demographics and clinical \ncharacteristics of the patients between the groups. For \ncontinuous variables, mean (SD) was calculated, a lin -\near model ANOVA test was used, count (percentage) \nwas calculated, and Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test was used \nfor categorical variables. Multivariable analysis was also \nperformed. Logistic regression was performed for use \nof AC/B&O in the PACU, and linear regression for pain \nscore and MME in PACU was used to adjust for use of \ngemcitabine in the PACU, transurethral resection of \nbladder tumor (TURBT) resection size, and the use of \nAC pre-procedure. A p-value of less than 0.05 was con -\nsidered significant. R statistical software version 4.0.3 \nwas used to conduct the analysis.\nResults\nA total of 182 patients were included in the analysis, with \n89 (48.9%) patients in the Mg group and 93 (51.1%) in \nthe control group. The average age at time of surgery was \n68, and 91.8% of the patients were male. Table\u00a0 1 summa -\nrizes the demographics and clinical characteristics of the \ncohort. The percentage of patients who used AC pre-pro -\ncedure was significantly different between the two groups \n(Mg 2.2% versus control 11.8%, p = 0.01); otherwise, \nthere were no significant differences regarding demo -\ngraphics or clinical characteristics. Table\u00a0 2 summarizes \nthe types of procedures performed in each group.\nUnivariate analysis showed the percentage of patients \nwho were given AC/BO in the PACU was significantly \nlower in the Mg group (9.0% vs. 21.7%, p = 0.02). No sig -\nnificant differences were found in maximum pain score \n(mean 3.5 vs. 3.2, p = 0.62) or MME (80.6 mg vs 81.8 \nmg, p = 0.94). These data are summarized in Table\u00a0 3. \nThe endpoints were then compared between the Mg and \ncontrol groups for each of the three procedure groups \nPage 3 of 6\n Salevitz\u00a0et\u00a0al. Perioperative Medicine           (2024) 13:91 \n \nindividually (Table\u00a0 3). No differences were found in \nthe use of AC/BO, pain scores, or MME in the PACU \nbetween the Mg and the control patients for patients \nundergoing RARP or endoscopic procedures of the pros -\ntate and urethra. For those who underwent procedures \nof the bladder, there was no difference in maximum pain \nscore or MME in the PACU between the Mg and control \ncohorts; however, there was a statistically significant dif -\nference in use of AC/BO in the PACU (9.5% versus 30.2%; \np = 0.02).\nMultivariable logistic regression showed that use of \nAC/BO in PACU was 66% lower for patients in the Mg \ngroup compared with control (OR 0.34, p = 0.02); how -\never, there was no statistically significant difference in AC/BO use between the Mg and control groups when \nstratifying by procedure type (p = 0.19). Multivariable \nlinear regression for maximum pain score showed no \ndifference in PACU maximum pain scores between the \nMg vs control groups (p = 0.71), but did show that pain \nscores were lower for patients who had bladder proce -\ndures (\u22121.42, p = 0.005) and endoscopic procedures of \nthe prostate/urethra (\u22122.71, p < 0.001) in comparison \nwith RARP . Multivariable linear regression for MME in \nthe PACU showed no difference between the Mg and \ncontrol groups (p = 0.86), and this again demonstrated \ndecreased MME in the PACU for the bladder (\u221223.55, p \n= 0.20) and endoscopic procedures (\u221273.46, p = 0.001) \ncompared with patients who underwent RARP .\nFurther multivariable analyses were performed for \nonly the bladder procedure group, due to the significant \ndifference found in AC/BO usage postoperatively on \nunivariate analysis. Demographics and clinical character -\nistics of patients who underwent procedures of the blad -\nder are shown in Table\u00a0 4. Notably, a higher proportion \nof patients in the control group used AC prior to their \nprocedure (4.8% versus 22.7%, p = 0.02), and a greater \nnumber of patients in the Mg group received intravesical \ngemcitabine in the PACU (31.7% versus 11.9%, p = 0.03). \nThere was no difference between the groups regarding \nproportion of patients with TURBT resection size \u2265 2 cm \n(44.7% versus 48.8%, p = 0.72).\nMultivariable analysis of use of AC/BO in the PACU \nbetween Mg and control groups was performed and \nadjusted for the use of gemcitabine in the PACU, TURBT \nresection size, and the use of AC pre-procedure (Table\u00a0 5).

Perioperative Medicine           (2024) 13:91 \nThere was not a significant difference in the use of AC/\nBO in the PACU between the Mg and control groups for \nbladder procedure patients, as the odds of using AC/BO \nin the PACU for patients in the Mg group compared to \npatients in control group undergoing bladder procedures \nwere 0.31 (CI  0.07\u20131.15, p = 0.09). TURBT resection size \n\u2265 2 cm was also found to be a significant predictor of the \nuse of AC/BO (p = 0.03) and maximum pain score (p < \n0.01) in the PACU. Multivariable regression found no \ndifference between the Mg and control groups regard -\ning pain scores and MME in the PACU. Due to the small number of patients who did not have a catheter in place \nafter a bladder procedure, we could not control for the \npresence of catheter in multivariable analysis. Of the 77 \npatients who had a catheter in place in the PACU, those \nwho did not have the Mg infusion had higher rates of \nAC/BO usage in the PACU (36.1% vs 9.8%), and none of \nthe patients without a catheter received AC/BO.\nDiscussion\nWhile multivariable analysis showed decreased use of \nAC/BO in the PACU after intraoperative magnesium \nsulfate infusion across the entire patient cohort, this sig -\nnificance was not seen when stratifying by procedure \ntype. Patients who underwent procedures of the bladder \nand endoscopic surgery of the urethra and prostate were \nshown to have lower pain scores than those who under -\nwent RARP , and patients who had endoscopic surgery \nused fewer MME in the PACU than after RARP .\nPostoperative pain control is a challenging part of any \nsurgery, and discomfort related to bladder spasms is \ncommonly encountered after many urologic procedures.

Perioperative Medicine           (2024) 13:91 \n \nMagnesium demonstrated in\u00a0 vitro effect of attenuating \noveractivity of detrusor muscle cells makes perioperative \nmagnesium infusion an appealing option to help reduce \nthe use of opioids and AC/BO in the PACU (Montgom -\nery et\u00a0al. 1992; Yu et\u00a0al. 1995). The present study shows \nthat intraoperative infusion of magnesium sulfate was \nassociated with reduced use of AC/BO medications \nacross the entire cohort. Univariate data suggests that \npatients benefitted most from Mg infusion if the proce -\ndural intervention directly involved the detrusor muscle, \nas opposed to the bladder neck (RARP , endoscopic pros -\ntate procedures) or further distally in the urethra. The \ndecreased use of AC/BO suppositories is clinically mean -\ningful in the context of their side effects and the tempo -\nrary discontinuation of BO suppository production (Bai \net\u00a0al. 2015; Li et\u00a0al. 2021; Iselin et\u00a0al. 1997; Wheeler 2024).\nPark et\u00a0al. performed a prospective, randomized, dou -\nble-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the use \nof magnesium sulfate to manage postoperative cathe -\nter-related pain after transurethral resection of bladder \ntumors (Park et\u00a0al. 2020). Sixty patients received a 50 mg/\nkg bolus of magnesium sulfate (0.2 mmol/kg) followed by \nan infusion of 15 mg/kg/h (0.06 mmol/kg), and another \n60 patients received normal saline in the same fashion. \nPatients in the intervention group received an average \nof 4.1 \u00b1 0.6g of magnesium sulfate. The study demon -\nstrated that patients who received Mg infusion had lower \nincidence and severity of bladder discomfort at 0, 1, and \n2 h postoperatively and lower severity at 6 h (Park et\u00a0al. \n2020). They also reported no difference in postoperative \npain scores, opioid requirements, or magnesium-related \nadverse events. Park et\u00a0 al. and much of the anesthesia \nliterature differentiate \u201ccatheter-related bladder discom -\nfort\u201d from postoperative pain (Bai et\u00a0 al. 2015; Li et\u00a0 al. \n2021; Park et\u00a0 al. 2020; Hu et\u00a0 al. 2016). In the present \nstudy, the majority of patients across all surgeries in the \npresent study did have a foley catheter in place postoper -\natively, so we were unable to make a meaningful compari -\nson between those who did and did not have a catheter \npostoperatively. However, across all surgeries, we did \nnot find significant difference in maximum pain score or \nMME in the PACU between the Control and Mg groups, \nthus challenging the results of the study by Park et\u00a0al.\nThis study is not without limitations, as it is a retro -\nspective review of a single institution over the span of a \nyear, limiting generalizability. Additionally, the urologic \nsurgeons, anesthesia, and PACU nursing staff were not \nblinded to which patients received the Mg infusion. For \nthis reason, provider bias in using certain analgesics can -\nnot be ruled out. Standardization of order sets for PACU \npain control was used, but additional medications given \non an as-needed basis was per the discretion of the anes -\nthesia and urology providers. Across all procedure types, the patients who underwent bladder procedures had the \nhighest rates of AC/BO use, so this study might have con -\ntributed to the significant difference on univariate analy -\nsis that was then lost on multivariable statistics.\nThere are several future directions in which this study \ncan be expanded. Continuing the magnesium infusion \ninto the PACU is the logical next step to examine its con -\ntinued postoperative effects to determine if there is added \nbenefit in pain control after the patient emerges from \nanesthesia. Intravesical infusion to bring the magnesium \nions directly to the source of the detrusor overactivity is \nalso an appealing concept to be explored. Furthermore, \nmixture with other medications such as lidocaine and \nheparin for additional pain relief can be investigated, as \n\u201cbladder cocktails\u201d are commonly used in the treatment \nof interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome in the out -\npatient and ambulatory surgical (Colemeadow et\u00a0al. 2020; \nHenry et\u00a0al. 2015). Additionally, this study did not inves -\ntigate serum levels of magnesium in the perioperative \nsetting. Perhaps patients who are hypomagnesemic prior \nto their bladder surgery benefit more from the intraoper -\native infusion in comparison with those who have normal \nMg levels before their procedure.\nConclusions\nWhile intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate during \nurologic procedures was found to improve AC/BO use \nin the PACU across all urologic surgeries investigated, \nstratification by procedure type and multivariable analy -\nsis did not show improvement in AC/BO use, maximum \npain scores, or MME received postoperatively. While \nintraoperative IV magnesium sulfate infusion may be a \nhelpful tool in the management of postoperative discom -\nfort in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures of the \nbladder, more studies are necessary to help elucidate this \nfurther.\nAcknowledgements\nNone\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nDS and KO responsible for writing of manuscript; MK performed statistical \nanalysis; DS, KO, MT, MH, and LM responsible for development of study\nFunding\nNone.\nAvailability of data and materials\nData is available by request of the first author, D.
