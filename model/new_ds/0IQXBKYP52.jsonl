This review aims to summarize the relationship between serum \nvitamin D status, assessed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level, and inflammatory biomarkers in children and \nadults with asthma.\nMethods  A literature search of interventional and observational studies on 25(OH)D up to November 2022 was \nconducted across six electronic databases. Outcomes of interest included a range of inflammatory biomarkers \nclassified in four categories: T helper 2 (Th2) pro-inflammatory, non-Th2 pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and \nnon-specific biomarkers. Study characteristics were extracted and risk of bias was evaluated using the American \nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics tool. Meta-analysis was conducted on studies with a low risk of bias, while \nnarrative reporting was used to present the direction of associations (positive, no association, or negative) for each \nbiomarker, overall and within the low-risk studies.\nResults  We included 71 studies (3 interventional, 68 observational) involving asthma patients. These studies \ninvestigated the association between serum 25(OH)D and Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers ( N = 58), non-Th2 \npro-inflammatory biomarkers ( N = 18), anti-inflammatory biomarkers ( N = 16), and non-specific biomarkers ( N = 10). \nThirteen (18.3%) studies, 50 (70.4%), and 8 (11.3%) were at high, moderate, and low risk of bias, respectively. In all \nstudies, irrespective of risk of bias, the most frequently reported finding was no significant association, followed \nby a negative association between 25(OH)D and pro-inflammatory biomarkers and a positive association with \nanti-inflammatory biomarkers. In low-risk studies, one biomarker could be meta-analysed. The pooled estimate for \n25(OH)D and serum IgE showed a negative association (\u03b2 (95% CI)= \u2212 0.33 (\u20130.65 to \u2212 0.01); I2 = 88%; N = 4 studies). \nA negative association between 25(OH)D and blood eosinophils was also observed in the largest of three studies, as Associations between vitamin D status \nand biomarkers linked with inflammation \nin patients with asthma: a systematic \nreview and meta-analysis of interventional \nand observational studies\nAsmae\u00a0El Abd1,2*, Harika\u00a0Dasari1, Philippe\u00a0Dodin1, Helen\u00a0Trottier1,2 and Francine M.\u00a0Ducharme1,2,3\nPage 2 of 19\nEl Abd et al. Respiratory Research           (2024) 25:344 \nIntroduction\nAsthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized \nby bronchial hyperreactivity and inflammation leading \nto preventable symptoms and exacerbations [ 1, 2]. In \n2019, approximately 262\u00a0million people were affected by \nasthma, resulting in 455,000 deaths [ 3]. Asthma is char -\nacterized by chronic inflammation that is mediated, in \nmany patients, by T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines, which can \nenhance the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the \nairways, activate resident immune cells, and trigger the \nrelease of inflammatory mediators [ 4]. Inflammatory bio -\nmarkers measured in sputum and serum can be used in \ndisease management, prognosis, and therapeutic adjust -\nment [ 5]. Key biomarkers include pro-inflammatory \nmarkers of Th2 inflammation, often measured in clinical \npractice and research in asthma patients, such as immu -\nnoglobulin E (IgE) [ 5\u20137], eosinophils [ 5, 8, 9], fractional \nexhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) [ 5, 10], interleukin (IL)-4, \nand IL-5 [ 11], as well as non-Th2 pro-inflammatory bio -\nmarkers, including neutrophils [ 12, 13], C-reactive pro -\ntein (CRP) [ 14, 15], tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [ 16], \nand interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) [ 17]. Additionally, several \nanti-inflammatory biomarkers, including regulatory T \ncells (Tregs) [ 18, 19], the antimicrobial peptide cathelici -\ndin (LL-37) [ 20], and IL-10 [ 11], have also been studied in \npatients with asthma.\nVitamin D deficiency and insufficiency represent a \nglobal public health problem affecting individuals of all \nages, with more than one billion children and adults at \nrisk worldwide [ 21, 22]. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) \nclassifies vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency as a \nserum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration \nless than 30 nmol/L and less than 50 nmol/L, respec -\ntively [ 23]. In patients with asthma, a lower level of serum \n25(OH)D has been associated with a greater risk of hos -\npital admissions, emergency department visits, exacer -\nbations, and use of rescue oral corticosteroids (OCS) for \nasthma [ 24, 25]. Several extraosseous anti-inflammatory \nand immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D have been \ndemonstrated through in vivo studies using animal mod -\nels, as well as through in vitro cell cultures [ 26]. Perhaps \neven more convincing is the evidence from meta-analy -\nses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which report \nan increase in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, \nsuch as IL-10, in both children and adults with asthma after vitamin D supplementation with doses ranging from \n800 to 400,000 IU over periods of 6 weeks to 12 months \n[27]. However, the relationship between inflammatory \nbiomarkers and vitamin D status, as assessed by 25(OH)\nD\u2014the most reliable indicator of vitamin D levels in the \nhuman body, influenced not only by vitamin D supple -\nmentation but also by factors such as diet, sunlight expo -\nsure, and genetic predisposition [ 28]\u2014is not yet clear. \nIndeed, numerous observational epidemiological stud -\nies conducted in children and adults with asthma have \nreported an inverse association between serum 25(OH)\nD levels and pro-inflammatory Th2 [ 29\u201336] and non-Th2 \n[36\u201340] biomarkers, as well as a positive association with \nanti-inflammatory biomarkers [ 40, 41]. However, there is \nsignificant heterogeneity and inconsistency in these find -\nings. Notably, some studies suggest a different direction \nof the association between 25(OH)D and these inflam -\nmatory biomarkers in asthma [ 36, 42\u201344], while others \nhave failed to demonstrate any significant association at \nall [29, 36, 39, 45\u201350]. Given these discrepancies, a com -\nprehensive review is crucial.\nThis systematic review aimed to synthesize the current \nevidence on the association between vitamin D status \n(25(OH)D) and inflammatory biomarkers in children and \nadults with asthma.\nMaterials and methods\nThe research protocol (#CRD42022365666) was regis -\ntered in the International Prospective Register of System -\natic Reviews (PROSPERO). We conducted this systematic \nreview and meta-analysis in accordance with guidelines \nspecified by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic \nReview and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement [ 51].\nSearch strategy\nA comprehensive search for relevant articles published \nup to November 24, 2022, was conducted by a trained \nlibrarian (PD) in six databases, namely PubMed, Medline, \nAll EBM (evidence-based medicine), Embase, CINAHL \n(cumulative index to nursing and allied health litera -\nture), and Web of Science. The complete search strategy, \nincluding Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms and \nkeywords used for each database, is detailed in Addi -\ntional file 1: Method S1. We also conducted a manual well as with cathelicidin (LL-37) in the only study reporting it. For other biomarkers, most low-risk studies revealed no \nsignificant association with 25(OH)D.\nConclusion  Serum 25(OH)D is negatively associated with serum IgE and possibly with blood eosinophils and LL-37, \nsupporting an in vivo immunomodulatory effect of 25(OH)D. Future research should employ rigorous methodologies \nand standardized reporting for meta-analysis aggregation to further elucidate these associations.\nKeywords  Inflammation, Asthma, Vitamin D, Biomarkers, Systematic review, Meta-analysis\nPage 3 of 19\nEl Abd et al. Respiratory Research           (2024) 25:344 \nsearch of the bibliography of the selected articles to iden -\ntify additional relevant studies.\nSelection criteria\nThe population of interest consists of individuals diag -\nnosed with asthma of any age (children and adults), sex, \nor ethnicity. Studies were eligible if they were RCTs, \npre-post intervention studies, or observational stud -\nies (cohorts, case\u2012control, or cross-sectional designs) \ninvestigating the association between vitamin D status \n(25(OH)D) and inflammatory biomarkers in patients \nwith asthma. The exposure of interest was vitamin D sta -\ntus, either reported as (i) continuous 25(OH)D serum \nlevels or (ii) categorical variable based on definitions (e.g., \ndeficiency, insufficiency, or sufficiency) used by included \nstudies. Outcomes of interest were all inflammatory bio -\nmarkers that were reported in included studies, grouped \nas follows: (i) pro-inflammatory biomarkers of Th2 \ninflammation (i.e., IgE, eosinophils, FeNO, Eosinophil \nCationic Protein [ECP], IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-33); (ii) \npro-inflammatory biomarkers of non-Th2 inflammation \n(i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, IL-31, \nCRP , Hs-CRP [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein], TNF-\n\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), \nneutrophils, and polymorphonuclear [PMN] cells); (iii) \nanti-inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., Tregs, IL-10, LL-37, \ntransforming growth factor-beta 1 [TGF-\u03b21], and adipo -\nnectin); and (iv) non-specific biomarkers (i.e., leucocytes, \nlymphocytes, platelets, Th1/Th2 ratio, hemoglobin, IgG, \nIgM, IgA, leptin, and resistin).\nWe did not consider the following designs: animal \nmodels, in vitro studies, narrative and systematic reviews, \nopinion papers, case reports, or abstract and conference \npapers. We also excluded studies involving mother\u2012child \npairs where vitamin D levels were measured in either the \nmother or the umbilical cord blood at or before delivery \nand where inflammatory biomarkers were assessed in the \nchildren. Additionally, we did not include interventional \nstudies where patients received any kind of supplemen -\ntation other than vitamin D (e.g., anti-IgE therapy) or \nwere exposed to vitamin D alongside other vitamins or \nmineral supplements, except for standard asthma ther -\napy. This exclusion criterion was applicable to interven -\ntional studies in which the inflammatory biomarker was \nnot assessed at baseline before supplementation, but \nonly at the endpoint or as a change from baseline. This \napproach was taken to avoid confounding effects of other \nimmunomodulatory interventions on inflammatory bio -\nmarkers and to ensure that our analysis focused solely \non the relationship between 25(OH)D and inflammatory \nbiomarkers.Study selection and data extraction\nTwo reviewers (AEA and HD) independently screened \nall titles and abstracts and then reviewed the full texts of \nthose studies deemed relevant. The following informa -\ntion was extracted independently using a predesigned \nform: study design, location, sample size, study popula -\ntion characteristics (number, age, and % male), vitamin \nD status, inflammatory biomarker results, main statisti -\ncal analysis methods, and, if applicable, adjustment vari -\nables included in statistical models. When multivariable \nmodels were presented, we extracted the results from the \nmodel with the best fit, including adjustment for relevant \nvariables. All conflicts between reviewers related to study \nselection and data extraction were resolved by discussion; \nthe input of a third independent reviewer (FMD) was \nsolicited in cases of disagreement. Covidence systematic \nreview software (2023, Veritas Health Innovation, Mel -\nbourne, Australia) was used to manage and streamline \nthe process.\nQuality assessment\nTwo independent reviewers (AEA and HD) evaluated \nthe methodological quality of included studies using the \nstandardized critical appraisal checklist designed by the \nAmerican Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [ 52] which \ncomprises ten validity questions related to study design, \naddressing aspects such as the research question, study \npopulation, sampling, intervention or exposure, outcome \nmeasurements, statistical analysis, and interpretation \nof findings. This tool offers a meticulous and rigorous \napproach to ensure objectivity, transparency, and repro -\nducibility, demonstrating higher inter-observer agree -\nment compared to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool [ 53]. \nIt is also specifically adapted to nutrition-related topics, \nwith a comprehensive focus on nutritional interventions \nand exposures, making it particularly useful and relevant \nfor our research question [ 54]. Reviewers assessed each \nstudy individually and determined its quality as high, \nmoderate (neutral), or low risk of bias. Any disagree -\nment regarding the methodological quality of a study was \nresolved by reaching a consensus or by consulting a third \nreviewer (FMD).\nQualitative and quantitative analysis\nThe results were presented both narratively and in tabu -\nlated form. A meta-analysis was planned only in studies \nthat used multivariate analysis to adjust for potential con -\nfounding factors or imbalances between groups, when \nthe following criteria were met: (i) at least two studies \nmeasured the same inflammatory biomarker from the \nsame body fluid using identical parametrization (i.e., \ncontinuous or categorical variable); (ii) adjusted \u03b2 coef -\nficients from multivariable linear regression and standard \nerrors (SE) or 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported \nPage 4 of 19\nEl Abd et al. Respiratory Research           (2024) 25:344 \nfor inflammatory biomarkers analysed as a continuous \nvariable; (iii) adjusted odds ratios (OR) from multivari -\nable logistic regression and SEs or 95% CIs reported for \ninflammatory biomarkers analysed as a categorical vari -\nable; and (iv) rated as being at low risk of bias. For inflam -\nmatory biomarkers measured at different time points, we \nonly considered the baseline time point. All 95% confi -\ndence intervals (CIs) were converted in SEs to facilitate \nthe calculation of the pooled associations. Heterogeneity \nwas assumed if I\u00b2 was greater than 50% and the P value \nwas less than 0.1 [ 55]. Adjusted estimates were combined \nusing the inverse variance method with fixed-effects \nmodel when I\u00b2 was less than 50%; else, a random-effects \nmodel was used. To explore the source of heterogene -\nity, we planned to conduct subgroup analyses on study \ndesign (cohort, case\u2012control, vs. cross-sectional studies), \npatient age (children vs. adults), and baseline 25(OH)D \nlevels ( < 50 nmol/L vs. \u2265 50 nmol/L). A sensitivity analy -\nsis was planned after excluding studies with asymmetric \ndata distribution, where the conversion of the 95% CI \ninto SE was imprecise. The analysis was performed using \nR software, version 2023.09.1 + 494.\nWhen meta-analyses for a given biomarker could not \nbe conducted (i.e., not meeting our stated criteria for \naggregation), the following complementary approach was \nused: for each inflammatory biomarker, we counted the \nnumber of studies reporting a significant negative, posi -\ntive, or no statistically significant association, considering \nthe results from all studies, irrespective of the risk of bias, \nand then focusing only on studies at low risk of bias.\nResults\nSearch results\nThe literature search yielded a total of 4,236 publications. \nAfter removing 1,891 duplicate records, the remaining \n2,345 citations were screened by their title and abstracts, \n164 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Sub -\nsequently, 93 studies were excluded for various reasons, \nsuch as not assessing the association between 25(OH)D \nand inflammatory biomarkers (59 studies), not focusing \non asthma (14 studies), and lacking relevant outcomes (3 \nstudies). Finally, 71 studies were included in the review \n(Fig.\u00a0 1).\nStudy characteristics\nSeventy-one eligible studies evaluated the association \nbetween vitamin D status and inflammatory biomarkers \nbased on measurements taken at a single point in time \nat the start of the study. These included 3 interventional \nstudies: 2 RCTs [ 38, 45] and 1 crossover trial [ 56], as well \nas 68 observational studies, namely: 8 cohort studies [ 29, \n30, 44, 46, 57\u201360], 10 case-control studies [ 31, 39, 40, 42, \n47, 61\u201365], and 50 cross-sectional studies [ 32\u201337, 41, 43, \n48\u201350, 66\u2013104] (Table\u00a0 1). Turkey contributed 11 studies (15.5%), followed by Egypt (8 studies, 11.3%) and Iran (5 \nstudies, 7.0%). Other notable contributing countries were \nChina, Poland, and United States\u00a0(4 studies each, 5.6%). \nMost studies were published in the past 6 years (Fig.\u00a0 2A). \nThey were conducted predominantly in children ( N = 50), \nwith the remaining focusing on adults ( N = 18) or both \npediatric and adult patients ( N = 3), with ages rang -\ning from 0 to 80 years (Fig.\u00a0 2B). The sample sizes of \nincluded studies varied widely, ranging from 13 to 847 \nindividuals; collectively, these studies involved 7,787 \nparticipants (Fig.\u00a0 2C). Vitamin D status (25(OH)D) was \nmeasured in all included studies, with a reported mean \nor median baseline values generally above 25 nmol/L, \nranging from 29.5 nmol/L [ 92] to 131.0 nmol/L [ 80] with \nthe exception of two studies in which lower values were \nobserved: one study with a median (interquartile range) \nof 18.5 nmol/L (10.0, 26.0) in a group of individuals with \nuncontrolled asthma [ 66], and another study showing a \nmean \u00b1 standard deviation of 20.6 \u00b1 2.0 nmol/L in a group \nof children [ 79]. In the remaining 16 studies [ 30, 32, 35, \n39, 41, 43, 50, 64, 73, 88\u201390, 97, 102\u2013104], the mean or \nmedian baseline 25(OH)D was not reported. As for vita -\nmin D status categories, most studies ( N = 34) adopted \nthe following classification: deficiency ( < or \u2264 50 nmol/L), \ninsufficiency (50\u201375 nmol/L), and sufficiency ( > or \u2265 75 \nnmol/L). Two studies used an alternative classification \nnamely, deficiency ( < or \u2264 25 nmol/L), insufficiency (25\u2013\n50 nmol/L), and sufficiency ( > or \u2265 50 nmol/L) [ 60, 96]. \nTen studies adopted a dichotomic classification; 6 stud -\nies defining deficiency ( < 50 nmol/L) and sufficiency ( > or \n\u2265 50 nmol/L) [ 38, 45, 84, 86\u201388], whereas four studies \ndefined deficiency or insufficiency as values < 75 nmol/L \nand sufficiency as values > or \u2265 75 nmol/L [ 34, 48, 49, 63]. \nFinally, thirteen studies adopted various other classifica -\ntions, while eight studies not using any specific classifica -\ntion criteria [ 33, 41, 57, 70, 85, 93, 102, 103].\nStatistical analysis and adjustment variables\nOf 71 studies, only 14 (19.7%) conducted a multivariate \nanalysis for at least one inflammatory biomarker, adjust -\ning for potential confounders such as age, sex, body mass \nindex, ethnicity, inhaled corticosteroids, season/month \nof blood collection, sun exposure, vitamin D supplemen -\ntation, vitamin D binding protein level, socioeconomic \nstatus, smoking status, alcohol consumption, upper \nrespiratory tract infections, pulmonary function, and/\nor asthma status [ 29\u201332, 34, 46, 57, 66, 73, 83, 86, 89, 95, \n103]. Other univariate statistical analyses were also uti -\nlized, mainly the Pearson and Spearman correlation coef -\nficients (r/\u03c1) (45 studies), univariate linear regression (4 \nstudies), Student\u2019s t test (6 studies), Mann\u2012Whitney U \ntest (6 studies), analysis of variance (ANOVA) (10 stud -\nies), Kruskal\u2012Wallis test (5 studies) and chi-square or \nFisher test (4 studies) (Fig.\u00a0 2D).\nPage 5 of 19\nEl Abd et al. Respiratory Research           (2024) 25:344 \nStudy quality assessment\nEight (3 cohort, 1 case\u2012control, and 4 cross-sectional) \nstudies (11.3%) were rated at low risk of bias. These \nstudies\u2019 methodology was strengthened by their use of \nmultiple regression models to adjust for confounding \nvariables. Conversely, 13 (1 case\u2012control and 12 cross-\nsectional) studies (18.3%) were rated as having a high \nrisk of bias; and the remining 50 (70.4%), at a moderate \n(neutral) risk of bias. Factors limiting the methodologi -\ncal quality of these studies included insufficient report -\ning of study inclusion & exclusion criteria and/or of data \ncollection methods, lack of adjustment for confounders, \nno/limited discussion about biases and limitations, and \nunclear declarations of conflicts of interest. The meth -\nodological quality of included studies is detailed in Addi -\ntional file 2: Table S1.Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers\nMost (58 of 71 (81.7%)) studies assessed the associa -\ntion between vitamin D status and at least one Th2 pro-\ninflammatory biomarker (Fig.\u00a0 2E). We distinguished 44 \nstudies on serum IgE, 28 on eosinophils (26 on blood and \n2 on sputum), 13 on FeNO, three each on IL-13 (two in \nserum, one in bronchoalveolar lavage) and IL-33 (one in \nserum, one in plasma, and one in nasopharyngeal fluid), \ntwo each on serum IL-4 and ECP , and one on serum IL-5. \nThese included 1 RCT, 5 cohort studies, 6 case\u2012control \nstudies, and 46 cross-sectional studies [ 29\u201337, 41\u201349, \n59, 61, 62, 64, 67\u201379, 81\u2013102, 104]. Regardless of the risk \nof bias, the interventional study (1 RCT) did not detect \na significant association between 25(OH)D and Th2 pro-\ninflammatory biomarkers. In observational studies, most \ncomparisons ( N = 58) also failed to detect significant \nFig. 1  Selection process for eligible studies from all identified citations \nPage 6 of 19\nEl Abd et al.

However, among those with statistically \nsignificant results, most indicated a negative association \nbetween 25(OH)D and Th2 pro-inflammatory biomark -\ners ( N = 31), while a few ( N = 6) revealed a positive asso -\nciation (Fig.\u00a0 3A; Table\u00a0 1). Only 7 (12.1%) of the 58 studies \non Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers were rated as hav -\ning a low risk of bias and focused on serum IgE, blood \nand sputum eosinophils, FeNO, and interleukins [ 29, 31, \n32, 46, 73, 86, 95] (Fig.\u00a0 2F).\nSerum IgE\nSix (13.6%) studies on serum IgE were rated at low risk \nof bias [ 29, 31, 32, 46, 73, 95]; all were conducted in chil -\ndren. Study sample sizes varied from 30 [ 29] to 616 [ 32] \nparticipants; their mean baseline 25(OH)D levels ranged \nfrom 44.9 nmol/L [ 31] to 64.2 nmol/L [ 29]. Due to dis -\ncrepancies in the parameterization of vitamin D and \ninflammatory biomarkers (i.e., continuous vs. categori -\ncal variables with different cut-off values), and the lack of \nreporting values on association estimates or 95% confi -\ndence intervals (CIs) for certain biomarkers [ 46, 73], our \nquantitative meta-analysis aggregated four of six low-risk \nstudies [ 29, 31, 32, 95]. Using the random-effects model, \nthe pooled estimate showed a significant negative asso -\nciation (\u03b2 (95% CI) = \u2212 0.33 (\u20130.65 to \u2212 0.01); I2 = 88%; \nP < 0.01; N = 4 studies) with significant heterogeneity \n(Fig.\u00a0 4). The association was affected by: (i) study design, \nwith a stronger correlation between 25(OH)D and serum \nIgE in the cohort study and cross-sectional studies, than \nin the case-control study (Fig.\u00a0 5A) and (ii) baseline vita -\nmin D levels, with a stronger association in studies with \nmean baseline 25(OH)D \u2265 50 nmol/L or unknown, than \nin those with vitamin D insufficiency (Fig.\u00a0 5B). Subgroup \nanalyses based on patient age could not be conducted, as all included studies pertained to children. A sensitivity \nanalysis that included the three studies with symmetri -\ncally distributed data confirmed the inverse association \nbetween 25(OH)D and IgE but failed to reach statistical \nsignificance (\u03b2 (95% CI) = \u2212 0.19 (\u20130.52 to 0.13); I2 = 60%; \nP = 0.08; N = 3 studies) (Fig.\u00a0 5C). Of note, two small low-\nrisk studies (one cohort and one cross-sectional) that \nreported their results narratively could not be aggregated \nin the meta-analysis [ 46, 73]; they mentioned no statisti -\ncally significant association between 25(OH)D levels and \nserum IgE levels. In summary, focusing only on studies \nat low risk of bias on serum IgE, three reported a statis -\ntically significant negative association, while one large \nstudy and two small studies (that did not provide numeri -\ncal values) concluded to no statistically significant asso -\nciation between 25(OH)D and serum IgE levels (Fig.\u00a0 6A).\nBlood and sputum eosinophils\nOnly three (11.5%) studies, all reporting blood eosino -\nphils, were rated at low risk of bias [ 29, 32, 46] but \naggregation of these studies was not feasible. A large \ncross-sectional study demonstrated a statistically sig -\nnificant negative association in 616 children whose base -\nline 25(OH)D levels ranged from 31.2 to 245.2 nmol/L \n(\u03b2 (95% CI) = \u2212 0.26 ( \u2212 0.48 to \u2212 0.05)) [ 32]. One small \ncohort study reported no statistically significant asso -\nciation between 25(OH)D levels and blood eosinophils \nin 67 children, with a mean baseline 25(OH)D level of \n53.1 nmol/L [ 46]. Another small cohort study found no \nstatistically significant association in 30 children with a \nmean baseline 25(OH)D level of 64.2 nmol/L ( r = 0.009; \np value = 0.923) [ 29].

In conclusion, no statistically significant associa -\ntions between FeNO and 25(OH)D were reported in two \nadult and one pediatric studies at low risk of bias.\nInterleukins\nWe identified one small cohort study at low risk of bias \ninvestigating the association between 25(OH)D and \ntwo serum interleukins in 30 children with a baseline \n25(OH)D level of 64.2 nmol/L [ 29]; no statistically sig -\nnificant association between 25(OH)D levels and serum \nIL-4 (\u03b2 (95% CI) = \u2212 0.10 (\u20130.80 to 0.46)) or serum IL-13 \n(r = 0.128; p = 0.099) was observed [ 29].\nNon-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers\nEighteen (25.4%) of 71 studies explored the associa -\ntion between pro-inflammatory biomarkers of non-Th2 \ninflammation and vitamin D, namely 2 RCTs, 2 cohort \nstudies, 4 case\u2012control studies, and 10 cross-sectional \nstudies [ 29, 36\u201341, 45, 57, 62, 63, 71, 74, 80, 83, 88, 100, \n103]. We identified seven studies testing serum Hs-CRP/\nCRP , five exploring IL-17 in the serum ( N = 3), plasma \n(N = 1), and airway lavage ( N = 1), four tested serum \n(N = 3) and plasma ( N = 1) IL-6, three on blood neutro -\nphils, two each on serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-12, and \none each on serum IL-3, IL-8, IL-9, IL-1, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, \nPMN cells and plasma IL-31. Irrespective of the risk of \nbias, in interventional studies, 1 RCT did not detect a \nsignificant association between 25(OH)D and non-Th2 \npro-inflammatory biomarkers, while another detected \na negative association. In observational studies, the majority ( N = 17) of comparisons did not find any statisti -\ncally significant association. However, some comparisons \n(N = 9) showed a negative association between 25(OH)\nD and non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers, while \nthe remainder ( N = 5) indicated a positive association \n(Fig.\u00a0 3B; Table\u00a0 1). Only two (11.1%) of these\u00a0 18 studies \non non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers were rated as \nhaving a low risk of bias [ 29, 57].\nThese studies evaluated the association between \n25(OH)D and serum IP-10, IL-2, IL-12, and/or IFN-\u03b3 \nlevels [ 29, 57]. One cohort study was conducted in 63 \nchildren with a median baseline 25(OH)D levels of 32.4 \nnmol/L in the acute asthma group and 61.1 nmol/L in \nthe controlled asthma group; it demonstrated no sig -\nnificant association with serum IP-10 levels (\u03b2 (95% CI): \n1.70 ( \u2212 2.6 to 6.0)) [ 57]. Another cohort study involving \n30 children with a baseline 25(OH)D level of 64.2 nmol/L \nalso showed no statistically significant associations \nbetween 25(OH)D and serum IL-2 ( r = \u2212 0.226; p = 0.072), \nserum IL-12 ( r = 0.151; p = 0.099), or serum IFN-\u03b3 ( r = \n\u2212 0.195; p = 0.064) levels [ 29]. Overall, in the two small \nstudies at low risk of bias, no meta-analysis was feasible, \nand no statistically significant associations were observed \n(Fig.\u00a0 6B).\nAnti-inflammatory biomarkers\nSixteen studies investigated the association between vita -\nmin D status and anti-inflammatory biomarkers. These \nincluded 2 RCTs, 6 cohort studies, 2 case\u2012control studies, \nand 6 cross-sectional studies [ 29, 30, 34, 36, 38, 40, 41, \n46, 50, 56, 58, 60, 63, 66, 72, 87]. Overall, seven studies \nexamined the association between 25(OH)D and IL-10 \nin the serum ( N = 5), plasma ( N = 1) and bronchial lavage \n(N = 1). Five studies examined LL-37 measured in serum \nor plasma (two each) and one in nasal secretions; four \nfocused on blood Treg cells, and one on serum TGF-\u03b2. \nWhen considering all studies irrespective of the risk of \nFig. 6  Summary of the type of association for inflammatory biomarkers explored in low-risk bias studies.

Respiratory Research           (2024) 25:344 \nbias, and for interventional studies (2 RCTs), no statis -\ntically significant associations between serum 25(OH)\nD and anti-inflammatory biomarkers were detected. For \nobservational studies, most comparisons ( N = 8) reported \na statistically significant positive association between \nserum 25(OH)D and anti-inflammatory biomarkers. This \nwas closely followed by no significant association in 7 \ncomparisons, and a negative association in the remain -\ning 2 comparisons (Fig.\u00a0 3C; Table\u00a0 1). Only two studies on \nanti-inflammatory biomarkers were rated as having a low \nrisk of bias [ 29, 46].\nThese studies evaluated the association between \n25(OH)D and serum LL-37, blood Treg cells, and/or \nserum TGF-\u03b2. Both cohort studies were conducted in \nchildren with mean baseline 25(OH)D levels > 50 nmol/L \n[29, 46]. One small study ( N = 67) demonstrated a statis -\ntically significant negative association between 25(OH)D \nlevels and serum LL-37 (\u03b2 (95% CI) = \u2212 0.018 (\u20130.032 to \n\u2212 0.003)) [ 46]. The other study found no statistically sig -\nnificant association between 25(OH)D levels and Treg \ncells (\u03b2 (95% CI)\u00a0 = 0.41 (0.23\u00a0to\u00a00.50), IL-10 ( r = \u2212 0.099; \np = 0.283), or TGF-\u03b2 ( r = \u2212 0.170; p = 0.064) [ 29] (Fig.\u00a0 6C).\nNon-specific biomarkers\nTen of 71 (14.1%) studies evaluated the association \nbetween vitamin D status and non-specific biomarkers \nthat are neither pro- nor anti-inflammatory (1 cohort \nstudy, 3 case\u2012control studies, and 6 cross-sectional stud -\nies) [ 37, 40, 50, 58, 64, 65, 72, 80, 88, 91]. No study was \nrated at being at a low risk of bias. Overall, the majority \n(N = 11) of investigations reported no statistically signifi -\ncant association with non-specific biomarkers; a minority \nof comparisons ( N = 6) observed a statistically significant \nnegative association, and one, a positive association with \nthese biomarkers (Fig.\u00a0 3D; Table\u00a0 1).\nDiscussion\nThis review summarizes 71 studies exploring the asso -\nciation between serum vitamin D status (25(OH)D) and \ninflammatory biomarkers in patients with asthma. Of \nthese, only eight studies (11.3%) were rated at a low risk \nof bias and served as the main basis for our conclusions. \nA meta-analysis of 4 studies was possible for a single bio -\nmarker\u2014a Th2 pro-inflammatory type\u2014showing a sta -\ntistically significant negative association between serum \n25(OH)D levels and serum IgE levels. In the small num -\nber of remaining studies at low risk of bias, the diversity \nof biomarkers studied, the variety of metrics used, and \nincomplete reporting prevented the quantitative aggre -\ngation of data. The reporting of the studies\u2019 direction of \nassociations within the context of a narrative review pro -\nvided some information. However, the inability to take \ninto consideration the precision of results\u2014that is, to dis -\ntinguish between evidence of no effect and no evidence of effect due to insufficient power in many studies\u2014made \nit challenging to draw firm conclusions about the true \nassociation between 25(OH)D serum levels and most \nbiomarkers.\nFor Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers, our meta-anal -\nysis of four studies at low risk of bias revealed that for \nevery 2.5 nmol/L (1 ng/mL) increase in 25(OH)D levels, \nserum IgE decreased by about 0.33 IU/mL. As subgroup \nanalyses highlighted a stronger association in children \nwith 25(OH)D levels above 50 nmol/L or unknown than \nothers, the linearity of the association remains to be \nestablished across the whole spectrum of 25(OH)D lev -\nels. The two remaining small studies at low risk of bias \nthat narratively reported no significant association, failed \nto provide numerical values of the effect\u2019s magnitude \nor precision, thus preventing any worthwhile contribu -\ntion to the conclusions. We were unable to find previ -\nous reviews examining the association between 25(OH)\nD levels and IgE, confirming a gap in the literature that \nour review begins to address. However, our results align \nwith other observational studies involving patients with \ninflammatory diseases that have reported a negative \nassociation between 25(OH)D and serum IgE, although \nwithout adjusting for potential confounders. Indeed, in \nchildren with gastrointestinal food allergies and atopic \ndermatitis, an inverse correlation between vitamin D and \nIgE levels was noted, with correlation coefficients ranging \nfrom \u2212 0.4 to \u22120.5 [ 105, 106]. As for eosinophils, although \ntwo small studies that could not be aggregated failed to \nidentify a significant association, possibly due to lack of \npower, we identified one large study that found a statis -\ntically significant negative association between blood \neosinophils and serum 25(OH)D; whereas the magni -\ntude of the effect corresponded to a weak association, \nthe lower limit (more negative) of the confidence inter -\nval indicated a moderate effect size. This observed nega -\ntive association is supported by the results of a study \nconducted in children with gastrointestinal food allergy, \nwhere children with low 25(OH)D ( < 75 nmol/L) had per -\nsistent blood eosinophilia compared to those with higher \n25(O)HD ( \u2265 75 nmol/L) (56% vs. 25%, P < 0.05) [ 105]. No \nsignificant associations with other Th2 pro-inflammatory \nbiomarkers, including FeNO, were observed, and we \ncould not find any previous reviews examining the asso -\nciation between 25(OH)D levels and those biomarkers. \nCollectively, our analysis suggests a negative association \nbetween serum 25(OH)D and serum IgE, and possibly \nwith blood eosinophils; no apparent association with \nFeNO; and insufficient data to conclude on other Th2 \nbiomarkers in asthma.\nWhen examining evidence from systematic reviews of \nvitamin D supplementation trials on Th2 inflammatory \nbiomarkers, the findings do not suggest a causal rela -\ntionship for the negative association between 25(OH)D \nPage 15 of 19\nEl Abd et al. Respiratory Research           (2024) 25:344 \nand Th2 inflammatory biomarkers, that is, a significant \ndecrease in these biomarkers following supplementa -\ntion. Our 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of \n13 intervention studies\u2014testing vitamin D supplementa -\ntion (cholecalciferol, calcidiol, and calcitriol) doses rang -\ning from 800 to 400,000 IU over periods of 6 weeks to \n12 months\u2014revealed no significant group difference at \nstudy endpoint compared to placebo, in serum IgE lev -\nels (4 RCTs, Mean difference [MD] [95% CI]: 0.06 [-0.13, \n0.26] IU/mL), blood eosinophils (3 RCTs, MD [95% CI]: \n\u2212 0.02 [-0.11, 0.07] 103/\u00b5L), FeNO (3 RCTs, MD [95% \nCI]: -4.10 [-10.95, 2.75] ppb), or other Th2 interleukins \nnamely serum [ 107], sputum [ 108], exhaled breath con -\ndensate IL-4 [ 109], and sputum IL-13 [ 108], among 1459 \nadults and children with asthma [ 27]. Our later findings \nare concordant with previous systematic reviews and \nmeta-analyses of RCTs that included the same or fewer \ntrials testing the impact of supplementation [ 110\u2013112]. \nDue to insufficient reporting, we were unable to aggre -\ngate data to examine whether, compared to placebo, vita -\nmin D supplementation was associated with significant \nwithin-patient decrease from baseline in Th2 biomark -\ners. However, a significant decrease in serum IL-13 was \nobserved in 86 adult patients supplemented with a daily \ndose of calcitriol for 6 months [ 113]. Indeed, included \nmost supplementation trials did not adjust for baseline \nvalues of biomarkers and potential confounders, nor \ndid they report the within-patient change in biomark -\ners between groups. Consequently, it remains unclear \nwhether the observed inverse cross-sectional association \nbetween 25(OH)D and serum IgE (and potentially blood \neosinophils) in this review reflects a direct effect of vita -\nmin D deficiency, an indirect effect through other media -\ntors, or a spurious association.\nAs for non-Th2 pro-inflammation, studies at low risk \nof bias identified in this review did not find a statisti -\ncally significant association between 25(OH)D levels \nand a variety of biomarkers, namely IP-10, IL-2, IL-12, \nor IFN-\u03b3. No study at low risk of bias was identified for \nnon-specific biomarkers, making it impossible to gener -\nate hypotheses. Additionally, no prior systematic reviews \nhave been found on the association between 25(OH)D \nand either non-Th2 pro-inflammation or non-specific \nbiomarkers in other inflammatory conditions. In a sup -\nplementation trial, no significant difference was observed \nat the 12-month endpoint in sputum IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 lev -\nels in 250 adults supplemented bi-monthly with 120,000 \nIU of cholecalciferol compared to a placebo [ 108]. The \npaucity of studies at low risk of bias, including supple -\nmental trials, prevent any firm conclusion regarding a \npotential association between vitamin D level or supple -\nmentation and non-Th2 pro-inflammatory biomarkers.\nRegarding anti-inflammatory biomarkers, the only one \n(small) study at low risk of bias reported a statistically significant negative association between 25(OH)D lev -\nels and serum LL-37 in children, suggesting less anti -\nmicrobial activity in those with higher 25(OH)D levels; \nno statistically significant associations were found for \nIL-10, Treg cells, or TGF-\u03b2. Of note, a supplemental \ntrial alluded to the opposite conclusion. Indeed, in 86 \nadults with asthma, supplementation with calcitriol for \n6 months resulted in a significantly greater increase in \nsputum LL-37 and serum IFN-\u03b3 compared to the pla -\ncebo group [ 113], suggesting more antimicrobial activity \nwith greater 25(OH)D levels. This is in concordance with \na study in primary cultures of normal human and cystic \nfibrosis bronchial epithelial cells, which showed that vita -\nmin D up-regulates cathelicidin expression and enhances \nantimicrobial activity in both settings [ 114]. Overall, the \nevidence from our studies at low risk of bias and supple -\nmentation trials suggests that 25(OH)D levels are pos -\nsibly associated with LL-37, but the direction of effect \nneeds to be clarified.\nOur findings revealed a negative association with IgE, \nand possibly with blood eosinophils and LL-37, con -\nsistent with recent mechanistic reviews. These reviews \nindicate that vitamin D reduces levels of pro-inflamma -\ntory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 [ 115, 116]. \nMoreover, evidence suggests that vitamin D influences \nB lymphocytes by inhibiting their differentiation, limit -\ning their proliferation, and decreasing immunoglobulin \nproduction such as IgE, while also boosting IL-10 pro -\nduction, thereby exerting an additional regulatory effect \n[115, 116]. It is important to note the dual role of LL-37, \nwhich can exhibit both pro- and anti-inflammatory \neffects, either directly stimulating inflammatory cells or \nmodulating the cellular response to specific cytokines \nor signals, which potentially explain the divergent find -\nings. Remarkably, it can rapidly transition from an anti-\ninflammatory to a pro-inflammatory state under certain \nconditions [ 117, 118]. Our findings underscore the \nmultifaceted role of vitamin D in modulating immune \nresponses, highlighting its potential as a crucial regulator \nof both innate and adaptive immunity. Yet, the paucity \nof high-quality in vivo data prevents any firm conclu -\nsion about this validity of these purported mechanisms of \naction in asthma patients.\nStrengths and limitations\nOur systematic review has several strengths and limita -\ntions. First, our study was comprehensive, as evidenced \nby our broad literature search across several databases, \nthe incorporation of various study designs, adult and \npediatric populations, and a wide range of inflammatory \nbiomarkers. Whereas the variability in the populations \nstudied, in age, comorbidities, vitamin D status catego -\nries, and asthma control status contributed to signifi -\ncant heterogeneity, it also increased the generalisability \nPage 16 of 19\nEl Abd et al. Respiratory Research           (2024) 25:344 \nof our findings. We adhered to well-defined inclusion \nand exclusion criteria, independent quality assessment \nusing a validated tool, systematic and rigorous approach \nto data extraction and assessment of analytic methods \nand focused our conclusions on studies at low risk of \nbias. However, the large body of evidence is weakened by \nthe small number of studies at low risk of bias (e.g., no, \nor inadequate adjustment for confounding, incomplete \nreporting of study selection criteria and/or of data col -\nlection methods, use of various metrics that prevented \naggregation). Whereas this review included interven -\ntion supplementation trials, most of them reported the \n25(OH)D and biomarkers at baseline and not over time. \nConsequently, the cross-sectional association between \n25(OH)D levels and some inflammatory biomarkers \nobserved in this review, do not imply causation as they \ncould be due to type 1 error or reverse causality. Indeed, \nwe cannot rule out the possibility that uncontrolled \nasthma might be independently associated with both a \nrise in Th2 biomarkers and reduced 25(OH)D, if the later \nacts as an acute phase response to inflammation [ 119] \nor if uncontrolled disease is associated with reduced sun \nexposure [ 120, 121] and thus vitamin D synthesis [ 122]. \nConsequently, monitoring these biomarkers in the con -\ntext of interventional vitamin D supplementation trial \nare crucial for tracking temporal changes and estab -\nlishing support for or against a cause-and-effect rela -\ntionship. Also, complete reporting of studies with high \nmethodological quality, featuring larger sample sizes, \nrobust designs, precise measurements, and strategies to \nminimize bias and reduced imprecision (e.g., by treating \n25(OH)D levels as a continuous variable) are essential to \nbetter address the questions. This approach would facili -\ntate the pooling of data for future meta-analyses, thereby \noffering more comprehensive insight into the in vivo \nmechanism of action of vitamin D in asthma patients \nby clarifying the direction, magnitude, and precision of \nassociations.\nConclusion\nMost of the published evidence regarding the associa -\ntion between 25(OH)D and inflammatory biomarkers is \nat significant (high or moderate) risk of bias, resulting in \na paucity of methodologically strong studies on which to \nbase firm conclusions. Studies at low-risk of bias suggest \na negative, but not robust, association between vitamin D \nstatus and serum IgE levels, a probably negative associa -\ntion with blood eosinophils and serum LL-37; collectively \nalluding to an immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D. \nFuture interventional and longitudinal studies, adjust -\ning for confounders, should examine the association over \ntime between serum 25(OH)D levels and inflammatory \nbiomarkers, to clarify our observations. Understand -\ning this relationship is crucial for developing targeted interventions and clinical guidelines aimed at optimiz -\ning vitamin D levels to manage inflammation in asthma \npatients effectively.\nAbbreviations\n25(OH)  25-hydroxyvitamin D\nEBM  Evidence-Based Medicine\nANOVA  Analysis of variance\nCINAHL  Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature\nCRP  C-reactive protein\nECP  Eosinophil Cationic Protein\nFeNO  Fractional exhaled nitric oxide\nHs-CRP  High-sensitivity C-reactive protein\nIFN-\u03b3  Interferon gamma\nIg  Immunoglobulin\nIL  Interleukin\nIP-10  Interferon gamma-induced protein 10\nIOM  Institute of Medicine\nLL-37  Cathelicidin\nMESH  Medical Subject Headings\nOCS  Oral corticosteroids\nPMN  Polymorphonuclear\nPRISMA  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and \nMeta-analysis\nPROSPERO  International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews\nRCTs  Randomized controlled trials\nTGF-\u03b21  Transforming growth factor-beta 1\nTh  T helper\nTNF-\u03b1  Tumor necrosis factor\u03b1\nTregs T  Regulatory T cells\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s12931-024-02967-z .\nSupplementary Material 1\nSupplementary Material 2\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Wael Abdelmageed for his assistance with article selection.\nAuthor contributions\nAEA revised the literature search strategy; performed the article selection, \ndata extraction, and quality assessment of the included studies; prepared the \nnarrative and quantitative analysis; and wrote the article.
