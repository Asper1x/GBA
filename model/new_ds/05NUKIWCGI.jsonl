The present study evaluated the viability of the forti\ufb01cation\nof lactose-free prebiotic Greek yogurt formulas with whey protein concentrate (WPC). Two rotational\ncentral composite designs (RCCDs) were applied: one to perform the hydrolysis of the whey protein\nconcentrate and another for the yogurt formulations ( \u000b= 2 with 2 central points and 4 axial points).\nTwo \f-galactosidase enzymes obtained from Kluyveromyces lactis were used. The content of lactose,\nglucose, galactose, and lactic acid were determined in the WPC, milk (pasteurized and powdered),\nand yogurts. The three best formulations regarding the attributes\u2019 viscosity, syneresis, \ufb01rmness,\nand elasticity were sensorially evaluated by using a nine-point hedonic scale. A microbiological\nanalysis was performed after 48 h of yogurt production. The characterization of the products and\nthe comparison of the results obtained were evaluated using the Student\u2019s Ttest and the analysis of\nvariance with Tukey\u2019s test ( p-values < 0.05). The application of a lactose-free WPC promoted viscosity,\n\ufb01rmness, and elasticity. The syneresis was reduced, and whey increased the protein and calcium\ncontent. Lactose-free WPC can be used as a partial substitute for skimmed powdered milk in yogurts.\nThe obtained results are encouraging with respect to the production of lactose-free Greek yogurts by\nthe dairy industry.\nKeywords: \f-galactosidase; rotational central composite design; physicochemical properties; sensory\nevaluation; microbiological analysis\n1. Introduction\nThe consumption of milk and dairy products is restricted for lactase-de\ufb01cient individ-\nuals [ 1]. Due to genetic variations occurring in some populations, lactase production is\nprogrammed to decrease over time. Asians, South Africans, and Native South Americans\npresent the highest prevalence of reduced lactase production [2,3].\nBy decreasing or avoiding the consumption of milk and its derivatives, lactose-\nintolerant individuals can reduce their incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms [ 4]. Nev-\nertheless, this strategy should be evaluated due to the potential nutritional consequences\nof reducing one\u2019s protein, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D intake [ 5,6]. A cohort\nstudy with lactose-intolerant adolescents assessed that a reduction in milk consumption is\nassociated with a reduced calcium intake [ 7]. Likewise, a reduction in dairy products may\nlead to nutritional rickets in children [8] and a low mineral density among the elderly [9].\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11233861 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 2 of 13\nConsidering that a high intake of fermented dairy products is inversely associated\nwith mortality and the incidence of hip fractures [ 10], the application of \f-galactosidase in\nthe fermentation of milk enables the acquirement of lower levels of lactose that are tolerated\nby lactose maldigesters [ 11] and is considered a growing trend in the dairy industry [ 12\u201314].\nGreek yogurt is a fermented product with a higher total solid concentration and,\nconsequently, a lower level of moisture than other yogurts. The preparation of this kind of\nproduct consists of the concentration of solids and the removal of acid whey to attain the\ndesired level of solids. Alternative processes involve the forti\ufb01cation of milk with protein\nconcentrates to enhance the protein content [15,16].\nThe addition of whey may increment the nutritional composition, mainly the protein\ninput, and improve the attributes related to viscosity and texture [ 17]. Thus, whey protein\nconcentrate can be used as a partial substitute for skimmed powdered milk [ 18]. The global\nproduction of whey is estimated at around 190 \u0002106 Ton/year; however, a large part of\nthis production is directly disposed into drains, which makes whey a major pollutant of\nthe dairy industry due to its high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), particularly due to\nthe lactose content of this product [19,20].\nThe high presence of lactose in whey restricts its application in formulations designed for\nlactose maldigesters. Moreover, there is a growing demand from consumers for high-protein\nand lactose-free fermented products [ 12]. In this context, it is essential to \ufb01nd alternatives for\nthe inclusion of lactose-free, dairy-based protein products for lactase-de\ufb01cient individuals.\nThus, different combinations of time and enzyme concentrations can result in a distinct\nindex that can promote the complete lactose hydrolysis and the incorporation of whey\nprotein concentrate into Greek-yogurts. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop\nlactose-free prebiotic Greek yogurt formulas with added whey protein concentrate and\ncalcium and that is rich in vitamin D.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Materials\nWhey protein concentrate (WPC) was supplied by Sooro\u00ae(Paran \u00e1, Brazil). The two\n\f-galactosidase enzymes Lactozym Pure 6500 L with a \u00156500 NLH/g declared activity and\nMaxilact LGX 5000 with a \u00155000 NLH/g declared activity were supplied by Novozymes\u00ae\n(Dittingen, Switzerland) and DSM Globalfood\u00ae(Delft, The Netherlands), respectively.\nPasteurized semi-skimmed cow\u2019s milk used in the yogurt formula was purchased by direct\ndelivery of Qualitat\u00ae(Paran \u00e1, Brazil). Ninho Forti+ Zero lactose powdered whole milk\n(Nestl \u00e9\u00ae) and liquid vitamin D 3(Power Vita\u00ae) were purchased in local stores. The selected\nlactic culture was supplied by Frimesa\u00ae(Paran \u00e1, Brazil); it consisted of the lactic bacteria\nStreptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii\n(Yomix 499 LYO 250 DCU\u2013Danisco\u00ae, Paris, France). Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) was pro-\nvided by Ingredion\u00ae(Balsa Nova, Brazil). Doremix BL H (stabilizer/thickener), composed\nof gelatin (85%) and guar gum (15%), was provided by Doremus\u00ae(S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil).\nAll reagents used in this study were analytical grade. Lactose, glucose, galactose, lactic\nacid, and calcium carbonate standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae(St. Louis,\nMO, USA).\nHPLC-grade sulfuric acid 98%, analytical grade D-(+) saccharose, D-(+) glucose, and D-\n(\u0000)fructose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals\nand reagents were analytical or chromatographic grade.\n2.2. Physicochemical Characterization\nThe pH of the samples was measured through the potentiometric method, with the use\nof an mPA210 model Ms Tecnopon Instrumenta\u00e7 \u00e3o\u00aepH meter (S \u00e3o Paulo, Brazil). Fat de-\ntermination in samples was performed according to the Roese\u2013Gottlieb 905.02 method [ 21].\nProtein concentration was performed through the Kjeldahl method (991.20), with the use of\na digester (DK20 model), recirculating water pump (JP model), puri\ufb01er (SMS model), and\ndistiller (UDK 139 model), from Velp Scienti\ufb01ca\u00ae(Bohemia, NY, USA) [21]. Whey protein\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 3 of 13\nconcentrate and yogurts had their calcium concentrations determined by atomic absorption\nspectrometry, following the 991.25 method [ 21]. The determination of the ash content in\nwhey protein concentrate was performed according to the gravimetric method (930.30) [ 21].\nThe moisture of whey protein concentrate was determined according to the gravimetric\nmethod (927.05) [21].\nYogurt ash determinations were performed according to the gravimetric method\n(945.46) [ 21]. Moisture and total solid analyses of yogurts were performed according to the\ngravimetric method (990.20) [ 21]. Total dietary \ufb01ber analyses of yogurts were performed\naccording to the enzymatic-gravimetric method (991.43) [ 21]. All analyses were performed\nin triplicate.\n2.3. Sugars and Lactic Acid Quanti\ufb01cation\nLevels of sugars (lactose, glucose, and galactose) and lactic acid in samples of whey\nprotein concentrate, pasteurized semi-skimmed milk, powdered milk, and yogurts were\ndetermined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nHigh-performance liquid chromatographer was used, equipped with a Varian ProStar\u00ae\n410 model automatic injector (Victoria, Australia), ternary pump (Varian, ProStar, 230 model),\nand refraction index detector (Varian, ProStar, 350 model) with 40\u000eC detection electrochem-\nical cell.\nA column oven produced by Young Lin Instrument\u00ae(Gyeonggi, Korea) was used at\n55\u000eC with sequential use of a Phenomenex\u00ae(Torrance, CA, USA) Rezek ROA column\n(30 cm \u00027.5 cm) and a Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae(St. Louis, MO, USA) Supelcogel C-610H column\n(30 cm \u00027.8 mm). Chromatographic separations were performed with a mobile phase of\nsulfuric acid\u2013water (8 mM) at a \ufb02ow rate of 0.5 mL/min and injection volume of 20 \u0016L.\nThe deproteinization of samples was performed according to Essig and Kleyn [ 22]\nwith some adaptations. Four-gram aliquots from the samples were used, to which 4 mL of\npotassium ferrocyanide solution at 15% and 4 mL of zinc sulphate solution at 30% were\nadded. After agitation and a rest for \ufb01ve min, the volume was raised to 50 mL with distilled\nwater. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 480 \u0002gfor 10 min. WPC sample was also\n\ufb01ltered with a Millipore172\u00ae(Darmstadt, Germany) PVDF 0.45 \u0016m syringe \ufb01lter before\nchromatographic analysis.\nThe analysis of fructose in FOS was performed with the Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae(St. Louis,\nMO, USA) Supelcogel C-610H column (30 cm \u00027.8 mm) at room temperature. The \ufb02ow\nwas 0.5 mL min, the injection volume was 20 \u0016L, and the mobile phase was composed of\nultra-pure water and 8 mM sulphuric acid.\nPeaks were identi\ufb01ed via comparison with the run time of sugars and lactic acid\nstandards; for quanti\ufb01cation, the external standard method was applied in triplicate, using\ncalibration curves with \ufb01ve points in the concentration range between 0.01 g \u0001100 g\u00001and\n0.45 g\u0001100 g\u00001.\n2.4. Experimental Planning\n2.4.1. WPC Hydrolysis\nFor the experimental planning applied to the hydrolysis of the lactose in WPC, two\n\f-galactosidase enzymes (EC 3.2.1.23) were used. Both were obtained from Kluyveromyces\nlactis . This process was conducted at 37\u000eC and pH 6.\nEnzymes were applied at different concentrations (0.15 to 0.30%) and times (101 to\n158 min). Thus, the percentage response of hydrolysis was studied through the following\nindependent variables: enzyme concentration (x 1) and time (x 2). The Rotational Central\nComposite Design (RCCD) was used in a 22complete factor scheme including four axis\npoints and three central points for pure error estimation, totaling 11 tests (Table 1). This\nstatistical design helps reduce the number of experiments and estimate all quadratic\nregression model coef\ufb01cients and the interactional effects of the factors [23].\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 4 of 13\nTable 1.

All experiments were conducted under controlled environmental conditions,\nusing a vertical Labconco\u00aelaminar air \ufb02ow cabinet, class II, type B2 (Kansas City, KS, USA).\n2.4.2. Yogurt Formulation\nFor yogurt\u2019s development, calcium carbonate (375 mg/100 mL), vitamin D 3(2 g/100 L),\nfructooligosaccharide (FOS) (3 g/100 mL), and thickener/stabilizer (0.6 g/100 mL) were\nadded to lactose-free semi-skimmed milk. Calcium, vitamin D, and FOS concentrations\nwere de\ufb01ned based on the Brazilian reference daily intake (RDI) of each substance for\nadults, whose values were 1000 mg, 5 \u0016g, and \u00152.5 g, respectively. No preservatives,\nsweeteners, sugars, aromas, or colorings were added. The elaboration of the yogurt was\nbased on work carried out by [11].\nPasteurized semi-skimmed milk had its lactose totally hydrolyzed by the addition of\n\f-galactosidase at 1.5 g/L. The hydrolysis process was achieved after 120 min at 38\u000eC; then,\nwe raised the temperature after this period (70\u000eC; 30 min) to deactivate the enzyme. This\ncondition was de\ufb01ned by preliminary studies based on enzyme hydrolysis experiments [ 11].\nThe lactose-free pasteurized semi-skimmed milk was elaborated specially for this work\nbecause there was no similar product to that which was available in the market during the\ndevelopment of the research.\nYogurts were developed by applying different concentrations of lactose-free whey\nprotein concentrate (LFWPC) (2.58 to 5.41%) and lactose-free powdered milk (LFPM)\n(2.58 to 5.41%). RCCD was employed to evaluate the effect of LFWPC or LFPM concentra-\ntion on yogurt formulations. Two factors with three central points were used with a 5%\nsigni\ufb01cance level (Table 2). The \ufb01nal mix was heated at 70\u000eC for 30 min and placed in\n145 mL plastic containers.\nTable 2.

Samples were kept at 42.5\u000eC\u00061\u000eC until\na pH range between 4.55 \u00060.05 was reached. Then, yogurts were cooled and kept at\n5\u000eC\u00061\u000eCfor 24 h to evaluate \ufb01rmness and elasticity, and for 48 h to evaluate viscosity\nand syneresis.\nViscosity, syneresis, \ufb01rmness, and elasticity responses were studied as a function of\nLFWPC (x 1) and LFPM (x 2). A sample yogurt (control) was elaborated, containing only\nlactose-free pasteurized semi-skimmed milk, as well as thickener/stabilizer and lactic\nculture in the same concentrations as the other yogurts. Finally, three treatments were\nselected to perform sensorial evaluation.\n2.5. Viscosity, Syneresis, Firmness, and Elasticity\nYogurt viscosity was determined at 25\u000eC using a Brook\ufb01eld\u00aeLVDV II+ viscometer\n(Middleboro, MA, USA) and an adapter for small samples (S70 spiral adapter) at a 100 rpm\nspeed. The scanning results were recorded 30 s after the beginning of the analyses.\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 5 of 13\nIn order to measure yogurt syneresis, the method described by Riener et al. [ 24] was\nused, with some adaptations. A total of 30 g of each sample was uniformly spread on\nWhatman\u00aen.1 \ufb01lter paper (S \u00e3o Paulo, Brazil); then, these were put into funnels and placed\non top of graduated cylinders. Sets were placed at 4\u000eC\u00061\u000eC for \ufb01ve hours. The expelled\nserum was collected, and the volume was recorded.\nThe pro\ufb01le analysis of yogurt texture (\ufb01rmness and elasticity) was performed ac-\ncording to Sandoval-Castilla et al. [ 25], with some adaptations. Firmness and elasticity\nparameters were quanti\ufb01ed as de\ufb01ned by Bourne [ 26]: \ufb01rmness\u2014the maximum required\nforce as the test cell penetrates 30 mm into the sample; elasticity\u2014the degree to which\na sample returns to its original shape after deformation. Yogurt texture characteristics\nwere obtained through a Brook\ufb01eld\u00aeCT3 Texture Analyzer (Middleboro, MA, USA). Ex-\nperiments were conducted through compression tests, namely, using a cylindrical probe\n(TA4/1000) with 38.1 mm diameter (distance: 10 mm, test speed: 1 mm s\u00001, compression\nforce: 4 g).\n2.6. Microbiological Analysis\nYogurt samples were kept refrigerated (5\u000eC\u00061\u000eC) until microbiological analysis,\nwhich occurred 48 h after their production. The counting of aerobic mesophilic microor-\nganisms, mold and yeast, total and thermotolerant coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus , lactic\nbacteria, Salmonella , and Bacillus cereus were performed following the methods recom-\nmended by the American Public Health Association [27].\nMesophile research was performed by the pour plate method in a Standard Methods\nAgar (PCA) at 35\u000eC for 48 h. Mold and yeast counting was performed by incubating the\nsample in a dichlorane rose-bengal chloramphenicol agar (DRBC) at 25\u000eC for 5 days.\nFor total and thermos-tolerant coliform analyses, samples were incubated at 35\u000eC for\n48 h in lauryl sulphate tryptose broth (LST). Samples that presented gas formation were\ntransferred to E. coli (EC) broth at 45\u000eC for 24 h and brilliant bile green broth (BGBB) at\n35\u000eC for 48 h. In order to analyze Staphylococcus aureus , samples were incubated in tryptic\nsoy broth (TSB) at 35\u000eC for 48 h. From each tube with growth, a culture was streaked\non a Baird\u2013Parker (BP) agar plate at 35\u000eC for 48 h. In case of typical colonies, they were\nsubmitted to con\ufb01rmation in brain heart infusion broth (BHI) at 35\u000eC for 24 h and a loopful\nwas transferred to the tryptic soy broth agar (TSB) at 35\u000eC for 24 h. The coagulase test\nenabled the identi\ufb01cation of the MPN/g of the microorganism in question.\nIn order to count lactic bacteria, samples were incubated in Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe\n(MRS) broth at 35\u000eC for 4 days.\nThe analysis of Salmonella sp was performed by incubating samples in Rappaport-\nVassiliadis Soya (RVS) broth at 41\u000eC for 24 h, and later plating them in a xylose lysine\ndeoxycholate (XLD) agar at 37\u000eC for 24 h. Results were expressed with respect to ab-\nsence/presence in 25 g.\nIn order to analyze Bacillus cereus , samples were forwarded to a laboratory specialized\nin food microbiological analysis that also used APHA standards.\n2.7. Sensory Analysis\nYogurts were evaluated by a team of 115 non-trained assessors that received the\nsamples in containers codi\ufb01ed with random numbers, followed by water. The test for\ngeneral yogurt acceptance was applied using a nine-point hedonic scale ( Like extremely = 9\nto Dislike extremely = 1). The project considered ethical aspects and was approved by the\nResearch Ethics Committee of the Universidade Tecnol \u00f3gica Federal do Paran \u00e1(UTFPR)\nwith CAAE n. 39499414.6.0000.5547. Assessors participated after agreeing to an Informed\nConsent Form.\nThe analysis was performed in individual computerized cabins, under controlled light\nconditions, and using the Fizz Sensory Software 2.47B program (Biosyst \u00e8mes, Couternon,\nFrance).\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 6 of 13\n2.8. Statistical Analysis\nData are presented as means \u0006standard deviation (SD). Data related to the characteri-\nzation of the products and the comparison of the results obtained were evaluated using the\nSPSS Statistics program, version 22 (Chicago, IL, USA). Data distribution was veri\ufb01ed, and\nthe Student\u2019s T test was performed, as well as the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), using\nTukey\u2019s test ( p-values < 0.05). The experimental design with the application of the Response\nSurface methodology was developed with the Statistics program version 7 (StatSoft) (Tulsa,\nOK, USA).\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. WPC Hydrolysis\nTable 3 shows the WPC composition used for the experimental design and optimiza-\ntion of hydrolysis. The high concentration of proteins and lactose that the product naturally\npresents is evident, whereas the quantity of the latter disaccharide in the WPC was approx-\nimately four times higher than the average in cheese whey (5%) [28].\nTable 3.

No product obtained in the research could have attained the attribute\n\u201clactose;free\u201d because their lactose concentration was higher than 100 mg of lactose per\n100 g. In Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, for example, the requirement\nfor lactose-free products is less than 10 mg/100 g of lactose. In Germany, Slovenia, and\nHungary, this threshold level is 100 mg/100 g [31].\nTests were performed to ensure the safety and feasibility at the end of each experiment.\nThe analysis of the stable mesophilic microorganisms in the WPC from all the experiments\nhad results lower than 36.103(CFU/g). This is lower than 1.105(CFU/g), which is the\nparameter required by the current law for powdered milk [32].\n3.2. Lactose-Free Yogurt Formulation\nThe analysis of variance data, obtained for the yogurt viscosity, shows that the concen-\ntration effects of the lactose-free whey protein concentrate and lactose-free powdered milk\nin linear terms, as well as their interaction, were signi\ufb01cant ( p< 0.05). The obtained per-\ncentage variation value (R2) was 0.94714, indicating that 94.7% of the response variability\nmay be explained by the used model (Equation (3)). In addition, the signi\ufb01cant value of the\nmultiple regression model analysis indicated the adjustment of the adopted experimental\nmodel ( p< 0.05).\nViscosity (mPa \u0001s) = 869.8396 \u000082.9702x1 \u000072.3534x2 + 39.2900x1x2 (3)\nwhere x1 = LFWPC concentration; x2 = LFPM concentration\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 8 of 13\nThe values calculated according to LFWPC and LFPM concentration for syneresis\nallowed us to identify that only the LFWPC variable was statistically signi\ufb01cant at linear\nand quadratic levels ( p< 0.05). The obtained value (R2) was 0.91144, indicating that 91% of\nthe response variability may be explained by the used model (Equation (4)). The signi\ufb01cant\nvalue of the multiple regression model analysis indicated the adjustment of the adopted\nexperimental model ( p< 0.05).\nSyneresis (%) = \u00004.64023x1 + 0.59375x12 (4)\nwhere x1 = LFWPC concentration\nThe models applied according to the LFWPC and LFPM concentrations for \ufb01rmness\nand elasticity presented R2values equal to 75% and 70%, respectively, as well as a lack of\nmodel adjustment ( p> 0.05). These models do not properly describe the relation between\nthe independent variables and response. A change in the value range of the studied\nvariables may adjust the models.\nIt is noticeable that in the higher LFWPC and LFPM concentrations, the yogurt vis-\ncosity values were higher than the ones found for the yogurts with lower LFWPC and\nLFPM concentrations (<4%). These higher ingredient concentrations in the yogurt formulas\nalso enable the achievement of lower syneresis values than those that could be obtained\notherwise.\nThe optimal range of the LFWPC and LFPM concentrations for the viscosity response\nwas equal to 5 to 6%. For the syneresis response, the LFWPC concentrations in the optimal\nrange remained between 4 and 5% and the LFPM concentrations between 4 and 6%.\nThe control yogurt sample presented lower viscosity and \ufb01rmness than the WPC-\nenriched yogurts. Its syneresis was approximately twenty-seven times higher than that\nof the yogurts developed with lactose-free WPC and powdered milk. There was also an\nin\ufb02uence of the LFWPC concentrations on the elasticity attribute (Table 4).\nTable 4.

Krzeminski et al. [ 18]\nand [ 33] also observed the positive action of whey proteins on yogurt\u2019s particle size, \ufb01rm-\nness, and viscosity. Whey proteins act as promoters of particle interaction and aggregation,\nwhich are important for yogurts, especially the more concentrated ones. The results of the\nstudy developed by Berber et al. [ 34] have shown that it is possible to completely replace\nnon-fat dry milk in yogurt formulations with 80% WPC while enhancing textural properties\nsuch as water retention, hardness, and viscosity, and reducing syneresis. The same occurs\nfor FOS, which is present in all the formulas at a concentration of 3%. This is regarded as a\nfactor that increases viscosity and \ufb01rmness, as veri\ufb01ed by Seckin and Ozkilinc [35].\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 9 of 13\nTherefore, due to the higher viscosity (854.00\u2013886.00 mPas), \ufb01rmness (0.1 N), and\nelasticity (10.27\u201312.12 mm), as well as the reduced syneresis (0.00\u20130.11%), treatments\n4 (5% LFWPC/5% LFPM), 6 (5.414% LFWPC/4% LFPM), and 8 (4% LFWPC/5.414%\nLFPM) were selected for physicochemical characterization and sensory analysis. Table 5\nshows the results of the physicochemical characteristics of these formulas. Through the\nchromatographic analysis, it was possible to verify the absence of lactose in these yogurt\nformulas (<10 mg \u0001100 g\u00001). With the absence of lactose in the dairy product and the\nconsequent increase in monosaccharides resulting from hydrolysis, the lactic bacteria used\nmainly glucose as the main substrate to provide energy and release lactic acid; thus, the\ngalactose concentrations were higher than glucose concentrations.\nTable 5.

Averages in the same line with different superscript letters have\nstatistical differences ( p< 0.05).\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO)\nrequire yogurt acidity (lactic acid g/100 g) to be at least 0.6 [ 36]. These three formulations\n(4, 6, and 8) comply with such lactic acid requirements.\nIn addition, the protein concentration in yogurt remained between 7.41 and 8.04 g/100 g.\nThe yogurts produced had a protein concentration above the average of lactose-free Greek\nyogurts with no addition of fruit pulps or other preparations. This high protein concen-\ntration is explained by the addition of whey protein concentrate. The addition of whey\nprotein concentrate appears to be a feasible alternative for the dairy industry, not only\nbecause it supports an increased protein intake, but also because it improves some sensory\ncharacteristics of interest, such as texture and viscosity. In addition to the quantitative\nperspective, it is important to consider the protein quality, since whey proteins present\nall essential amino acids, including branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and\nvaline), and are recognized as proteins with a high biological value and that can be quickly\nabsorbed [34,37,38]\nAs for fat, formula 4 presented a higher concentration than the others, but there\nwas no signi\ufb01cant statistical difference. Tamime and Robinson [ 39] researched the fat\nconcentration of different Greek yogurts produced by ultra\ufb01ltration, fat addition, or by\nmechanical separators; the average concentration was from 6.1 to 9.2 (g/100 g).\nIn this study, the method used to obtain Greek yogurts was the addition of ingredients\n(a stabilizer/thickener, whey protein concentrate, powdered milk, and fructooligosaccha-\nride) that promote characteristics of interest in Greek yogurt, and that are nutritionally\ninteresting for lactose-intolerant people.\nThe ash concentration in this study\u2019s yogurts (1.37 \u00060.06 to 1.39 \u00060.06 g/100 g) is\nhigh when compared to other concentrated yogurts. Serafeimidou et al. [ 40] researched\ntwenty-four samples of Greek yogurts sold in Greece, and the ash concentrations remained\nbetween 0.632 \u00060.022 to 1.107 \u00060.006 (g/100 g).\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 10 of 13\nThe increased content of calcium in our yogurts was due to the addition of calcium\ncarbonate. When compared to other sources commonly used in food, calcium carbonate\nhas the highest concentration of the mineral [ 41]. Through calcium supplementation, it\nwas possible to reach 15.56% to 22% of the daily recommendation for adults (1000 mg\nday) [ 42]. The yogurts with higher LFWPC concentrations ( \u00155%) obtained higher calcium\nlevels, since the LFWPC contained 806.21 \u00065.40 (mg/100 g) calcium, whereas for LFPM\nthe content was equal to 590.19 \u00061.11 (mg/100 g).\nThe products also reached 40% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin D for\nadults (5 \u0016g day) [42].\nThrough the addition of fructooligosaccharide (FOS), the three yogurt formulas could\nbe labeled as having prebiotic properties. This product was analyzed by HPLC, whereby\nthe presence of 8% fructose in the free form was veri\ufb01ed, indicating that the product was\nintact and would act as dietary \ufb01ber.\nFructooligosaccharide is a non-digestible substance that acts as a prebiotic and modu-\nlates intestinal microbiota, thus having an important function for lactose-intolerant people,\nwho often present an imbalance in the composition of endogenous bacteria in their in-\ntestines. Fructooligosaccharide is fermented by the bene\ufb01cial bacteria inside the colon,\nlactobacilli and bi\ufb01dobacteria, forming short-chain fatty acids that can boost enterocyte cell\nproliferation, stimulate the function of the immune system, and regulate fat metabolism,\nthereby limiting lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis [ 43]. This component has a bene\ufb01cial\neffect on mineral absorption, mainly with respect to calcium. The production of short-chain\nfatty acids promotes the decrease in the intestinal pH, which turns insoluble calcium into its\nionic form, helping its absorption [ 44]. In addition to nutritional bene\ufb01ts, fructooligosaccha-\nride (FOS) presents technological properties, being a substitute for sucrose and possessing\na great water retention capacity, high solubility and stability, and offering an excellent\namount of energy [45].\n3.3. Microbiological Analysis\nThe average count of lactic bacteria was equal to 6.90 \u00060.63 log CFU/g for sample\n4, 6.88 \u00060.67 log CFU/g for sample 6, and 6.91 \u00060.68 log CFU/g for sample 8. These\nresults respect the minimum lactic bacteria count established by the FAO and WHO for\nyogurts (107CFU/g). The results of the microbiological analyses of the three yogurt\nformulas (4, 6 and 8) showed lower counts than the upper limits established by the local\nlegislation [ 32,46]]. The yogurts presented a count of mesophiles < 4.73.103CFU/g, total\ncoliforms < 9Bra3 MPN/g and thermotolerants < 3 MPN/g, a count of Staphylococcus aureus\n< 23 MPN/g, no molds and yeasts, and a Bacillus cereus count < 1.10 CFU/g. There were\nnoSalmonella sp in the three samples analyzed.\n3.4. Sensory Evaluation\nThe general acceptability averages of formulas 4, 6, and 8 were: 6.61 \u00061.71, 6.7 \u00061.74,\nand 6.57 \u00061.78, respectively. The formula with the highest concentration of whey protein\nconcentrate (5.41%) resulted in a higher general acceptance than the formulas with lower\nconcentrations of this ingredient. However, there was no statistical difference among the\nthree tested formulas ( p> 0.05).\nAlthough it is a common practice to add sugar to improve the sensory characteristics\nof food products, no sugars or sweeteners were added to these yogurts. Even without\nthe addition of sugar and arti\ufb01cial sweeteners, one noticeable characteristic in the yogurts\nwas their sweetness, which is attributable to the fact that the sugars resulting from the\nhydrolysis of lactose have a stronger sweetening power than lactose itself [47].\n4. Conclusions\nThe main highlights of this research are related to the process of obtaining a lactose-free\nproduct by applying enzymes and time under optimized conditions. The best hydrolysis\ncondition, defined by using the response surface methodology , had a variation in the enzyme\nFoods 2022 ,11, 3861 11 of 13\nconcentration from 0.23 to 0.30% and a time variation that was from 125 to 150 min. The opti-\nmization of hydrolysis promoted the absence of lactose in the yogurt formulas (<10 mg \u0001100 g\u00001).\nThe obtained results revealed that the addition of lactose-free whey protein con-\ncentrate in Greek yogurts promoted their rheological characteristics and sensory prop-\nerties. The yogurt formulas with 4\u20135.41% lactose-free WPC presented higher viscosity\n(854.00\u2013886.00 mPas) , \ufb01rmness (0.1 N), and elasticity (10.27\u201312.12 mm), as well as reduced\nsyneresis (0.00\u20130.11%). Moreover, adding this ingredient contributed to the increase in the\nprotein (7.41 and 8.04 g/100 g) and calcium content, which were allowed to reach 15.56%\nto 22% of the daily recommendation for adults. The yogurt formulas were well accepted by\nthe assessors with a general acceptance of 6.57 \u00061.78 to 6.7 \u00061.74. The results demonstrate\nthat the addition of lactose-free whey protein concentrate in Greek yogurts promotes both\ntheir rheological characteristics and sensory properties.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.M.B.C.; Methodology, A.T.d.S., J.J.d.L., P .R., M.P . and\nC.G.B., Statistical analysis, A.T.d.S. and C.C.H.K.; Graphical abstract and editing, A.B.S., Writing and\nreview, A.T.d.S., C.C.H.K. and L.M.B.C.
