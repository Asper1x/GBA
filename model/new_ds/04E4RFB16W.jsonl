We undertook a systematic review to answer the question of \nwhether ginger has a role in modifying the biomarkers of cancer in cell culture con -\nditions and on colorectal cancer in randomized clinical trials. We performed a com -\nprehensive search of the literature from Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, \nCochrane central register of controlled trials, and Cochrane database of systematic \nreviews. At first, all 12 papers studied the effect of ginger or its derivatives on cell cul -\nture conditions. The results of cell culture studies show that ginger has a powerful role \nin inducing apoptosis. In the second part, five studies of clinical trials were analyzed. \nBy analyzing antitumor markers of clinical trials, ginger increased some anticancer \nmarkers but performed poorly in inducing some anticancer markers. This systematic \nreview showed that the consumption of ginger extract has the potential to prevent \nand treat colorectal cancer but this ability is weak.\nKEYWORDS\nanticancer plant, cell culture, colorectal cancer, ginger, systematic review\n652\u2003 |\u2003\u2003\u2002\nNACHVAK  et al.\n1\u2003|\u2003INTRODUCTION\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor with high mor -\nbidity and mortality worldwide. The most crucial cause of colon can -\ncer can be considered aging and unhealthy lifestyle as well as genetic \npredisposition. Among unhealthy lifestyle factors, there is growing ev -\nidence about the roles of dietary components such as red meats, pro -\ncessed meats, and alcohol in the occurrence and development of CRC \n(Bent & Ko, 2004 ). On the other hand, some nutraceuticals in specific \nfoods have benefits as well as few side effects in arresting cancer cells.\nGinger ( Zingiber officinale ) has been used worldwide as a spice, \ncondiment, and medicinal remedy in many countries. Ginger and its \nactive compounds, such as 6-  gingerol and 6-  shogaol, have shown ben -\neficial biological effects including hepatoprotective, anti-  inflammation, \nantioxidation, and anticancer activities (Kim et al., 2014 ; Samadi \net al., 2022 ). In many in vitro studies, it has been reported that gin -\nger has a high ability to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells \n(Arablou et al., 2014 ; Shidfar et al., 2015 ). One research has shown that \nginger components such as 6-  and 10-  gingerols have a beneficial role in \nthe treatment of cervical cancer (Zhang et al., 2017 ). 6- gingerol has in -\nhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and blocked G1 cell-  cycle \narrest in human colorectal cancer cells (Lee et al.,  2008 ). In addition, it \ncan induce apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma cells through the \nactivation of caspases (cysteine-  aspartic proteases, cysteine aspartate, \nor cysteine- dependent aspartate- directed proteases) and the produc -\ntion of reactive oxygen species (Lee et al.,  2008 ). Several studies have \nshown that gingerol modulates a variety of cell signaling pathways \nlinked to cancer, including nuclear factors (NF-  \u03baB), signal transducer \nand activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), activator protein-  1 (AP-  1), \u03b2- \ncatenin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial \ngrowth factor receptor (VEGFR), mitogen-  activated protein kinases \n(MAPK), and pro-  inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis fac -\ntor (TNF-  \u03b1) and cyclooxygenase-  2 (COX-  2) (Jemal et al., 2009 ; Ling \net al., 2010 ). In some studies, it has been also shown that the anticancer \nactivity of ginger extract is significantly higher than curcumin in brain \ncancer cells (Ramachandran, Lollett, et al., 2015 ).\nSince the cancer cell line models are a very useful diagnostic \ntool for the diagnosis of cancer at the starting point, most studies \ninvestigated the anticancer role of ginger in cell culture (Mirabelli \net al., 2019 ). Questions in this study are as follows: Does ginger have \na role in modifying the biomarkers of cancer in cell culture condi -\ntions? Does ginger have a role in modifying the biomarkers in col -\norectal cancer in clinical trials? At the end of this study, we compared \nthe changes in cancer biomarkers in both conditions.\n2\u2003|\u2003METHODS AND MATERIALS\n2.1\u2003 |\u2003 Study design\nThis systematic review was performed by the preferred reporting \nitems of systematic reviews and meta-  analyses (PRISMA) state -\nment (Liberati et al., 2009 ). This systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews \n(PROSPERO) in 2022 (ID:CRD42022369388). Briefly, the aim is to \nidentify the anticancer effects of ginger in cancer cell line models \nand clinical trials.\n2.2\u2003 |\u2003 Search strategy\nWe systematically searched the Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, \nPubMed, Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CCTR), \nand Cochrane database of systematic reviews (CDSR) databases. \nKeywords for search in these databases were included:\n1. For the first question: (\u201cGinger\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201cGingerol\u201d \nOR \u201cShogaol\u201d) AND (\u201cCarcinogenesis\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \n\u201cCarcinogenesis\u201d OR \u201cCell Transformation\u201d OR Neoplasms) \nOR (\u201cTumor\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201cCell Line\u201d[MeSH Terms] \nOR \u201cCell Cultures\u201d OR \u201cTumor Cell Lines\u201d OR \u201cTumor Cell \nLine\u201d)\n2.

To avoid bias, they were blinded to the names, \nqualifications, or institutional affiliations of the study authors. The \nfull text of studies meeting inclusion criteria was retrieved and \nscreened to determine eligibility by two reviewers. Following the \nassessment of methodological quality, two researchers extracted \ndata using a purpose-  designed data extraction form and indepen -\ndently summarized what they considered to be the most impor -\ntant results from each study. These summaries were compared, \nand then any differences of opinion were resolved by discussion \nand consultation with a third reviewer. Any further calculations \non study data considered necessary were conducted by the first \nreviewer and checked by the second reviewer. If the two authors \nfailed to reach a consensus, the third author was involved in mak -\ning a final decision.\n\u2003\u2002\u2003|\u2003 653\nNACHVAK  et al.\n2.4\u2003 |\u2003 Eligibility criteria\nWe included studies in this review if they were conducted on the an -\nticancer effects of ginger at the cell culture condition and randomized \nclinical trials (RCT) that were published in the English language. Also, \nthe studies included in this paper are clinical trials involving human \nparticipants with normal and increased risk of colorectal cancer. \nExclusion criteria were as follows: articles that did not interfere with \nGinger; articles that do not investigate cancer in cell culture and do not \ninvolve human participants with colorectal cancer; and articles that \ndo not investigate the role of ginger in preventing and treating cancer.\n2.5\u2003 |\u2003 Methodological quality assessment\nThe Cochrane risk-  of- bias tool for randomized trials was used to as -\nsess the quality of the studies included in this systematic review. This \ntool consists of five bias domains, including selection bias (random \nsequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias \n(blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (blinding of \noutcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete data outcome), and \nreporting bias (selective outcome reporting). We categorized clinical \ntrial studies as Yes (low risk of bias), No (high risk of bias), or Unclear \nfor each domain. Finally, the overall quality of the studies was catego -\nrized into weak, fair, or good, if <3, 3, or \u22654 domains were rated as low \nrisk, respectively (Higgins et al., 2019 ; Raeisi-  Dehkordi et al., 2019 ).2.6\u2003 |\u2003 Data extraction\nIn the present study, we analyzed several factors to evaluate the ef -\nfect of ginger in preventing or treating cancer. One of the most im -\nportant and key pathways to understanding the anticancer role of \nginger is to study apoptosis. Therefore, we analyzed caspases, B-  cell \nlymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL2-  associated X (BAX), and p21 to investigate \nthe role of ginger in inducing apoptosis. Matrix metalloproteinases \n(MMPs) were analyzed to investigate the role of ginger in the prolifer -\native factors. Also, to investigate the anti-  inflammatory effect of gin -\nger, we analyzed the role of ginger in reducing inflammatory factors \nand enzymes involved in the inflammatory process such as cyclooxy -\ngenases (COXs), 5-  lipoxygenase (5-  LOX), 12-  LOX, 15-  LOX-  2, prosta -\nglandin E2 (PGE2), and 15-  hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-  HETE).\n3\u2003|\u2003RESULTS\nWe initially identified 1298 nonduplicate articles through a system -\natic search. After appraising the title/abstract of articles, 1233 ar -\nticles were excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria. Of the \n65 remained articles, finally, 17 full-  text articles were selected that \ncould gain inclusion criteria ( Figure  1). Twelve papers have evaluated \nthe effect of ginger or its derivatives on cell culture conditions, and \nfive papers have evaluated the effect of ginger and its derivatives on \ncolorectal cancer biomarkers in clinical trials.\nFIGURE 1\u2003Flow diagram illustrating \ndata collection protocol employed in this \nstudy.Additional recodes identified  \nthrough other sources \n(N=404) Records identified through \ndatabase searching \n (N=1250) \n1298 non-duplicate records were screened\n1233 unrelated articles were excluded \nafter title/abstract screening \n65 full-text articles were  \nscreened\n48 full-text articles were excluded  \nafter assessing eligibility criteria  \n17 eligible articles were  \nincluded in the qualitative  \nsynthesis\n654\u2003 |\u2003\u2003\u2002\nNACHVAK  et al.\nTABLE 1 \u2003Effect of ginger extract on cell culture biomarkers\nFirst author and \ncontraryStudy \ndesign Type of treatment Culture media Methodology Dose of treatment Duration Events observed\nRamachandran \net al.

Studies \nshowed that Bax is increased and induced the opening of the mito -\nchondrial voltage-  dependent anion channel, so the death of the cell \nis guaranteed (Mignard et al., 2014 ). The Bcl-  2 family of regulator \nproteins regulated apoptosis, by either inhibiting (anti-  apoptotic) or \ninducing (pro-  apoptotic) apoptosis. In all of these studies, it has been \nshown that the amount of Bcl-  2 in the treated cells with ginger has \ndecreased, and conversely, Bax has increased.\nSeven articles studied the role of proliferative factors and \nMMPs (Lee et al., 2008 ; Ling et al., 2010 ; Ramachandran, Quirin, \net al., 2015 ). MMPs have been implicated as possible mediators \nof invasion and metastasis in some cancers (Kim et al., 2014 ). \nFive studies have studied the anti-  inflammatory effects and \nthese papers have shown that treating cells with ginger reduced \ninflammation (Ishiguro et al.,  2007 ; Ling et al., 2010 ; Miyoshi \net al., 2003 ; Romero et al., 2018 ; Saha et al., 2014 ). Also, four pa -\npers have proven that ginger has increased the activity of caspases \n(Choudhury et al., 2010 ; Ishiguro et al., 2007 ; Miyoshi et al., 2003 ; \nRamachandran, Quirin, et al.,  2015 ). All in vitro studies have shown \nthat the treatment of cells with ginger stops their cell growth and \ncauses cell death ( Table  1).\n3.2\u2003 |\u2003 Biomarker analyzed on randomized \nclinical trials\nFive clinical trials have studied the effect of ginger and its deriva -\ntives on colorectal cancer. Table  2 sho w s  the  qual i ty  o f  the  stud -\nies based on the Cochrane risk-  of- bias tool. Of these ( Table  3), four \nhave been conducted in the United States (Citronberg et al., 2013 ; \nJiang et al., 2013 ; Zick et al., 2011 ; Zick et al., 2015 ). Another arti -\ncle from Thailand studied patients with colorectal cancer (Danwilai \net al., 2017 ). The study by Danwilai et al., on 2017, subjects with \ncolorectal cancer showed that the ginger significantly increased \nsuperoxide dismutase (837\u2009\u00b1\u200974.9 vs. 442.3 \u00b1\u200931.6 U/ml), catalase \n(68.1  \u00b1\u20093.4 vs. 44.4 \u00b1\u20092.3 kU/ml), glutathione peroxidase (23.0 \u00b1\u20091.3 \nvs. 10.8 \u00b1\u20090.9 U/ml), and reduced/oxidized glutathione (23.4 \u00b1\u20091.3 \nvs. 15.1 \u00b1\u20091 U/ml) compared to placebo (Danwilai et al., 2017 ). In \nfour articles that were in America (Citronberg et al., 2013 ; Jiang \net al., 2013 ; Zick et al., 2011 ; Zick et al., 2015 ), special markers \nwere studied after the administration of the same dose of ginger \n(2 g/day) for patients with colorectal cancer or high-  risk individu -\nals. Citronberg et al., reported that consumption of 2 g/day gin -\nger for 28\u2009days unchanged the expression of Bax (15.6%; p =\u2009.78), \np21 (18.2%; p =\u2009.43), Bcl2, and MIB-  1/Ki-  67 (16.9%; p =\u2009.39) in the \nwhole colorectal crypts, while human telomerase reverse tran -\nscriptase (hTERT) expression significantly decreased in the whole \ncolorectal crypts (41.2%; p =\u2009.05) and in the upper 40% of crypts First author and \ncontraryStudy \ndesign Type of treatment Culture media Methodology Dose of treatment Duration Events observed\nRomero \net al.

Zick et al. reported gas -\ntrointestinal symptoms in five subjects (35.7%) and headache in one \nsubject (7.14; discontinue) with ginger consumption among subjects \nat normal risk for colorectal cancer (Zick et al., 2011 ). In another \nstudy, the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase were signifi -\ncantly increased in two subjects (from 35 to 65 and 31 to 42\u2009U/L) \n(Danwilai et al., 2017 ). No significant adverse events related to gin -\nger extract were observed in both studies.\n4\u2003|\u2003DISCUSSION\nApoptosis is programmed cell death that provides instructions and \nconditions for cancer cell death (Wlodkowic et al., 2011 ). Caspases \nare a family of protease enzymes and play essential roles in pro-\ngrammed cell death  (Galluzzi et al.,  2016 ). In vitro studies have shown \nthat treatment with ginger stops cancer cell growth and causes cell \ndeath through the activation of Bax. This protein increases and in -\nduces the opening of the mitochondrial voltage-  dependent anion \nchannel, so the death of the cell is guaranteed (Mignard et al., 2014 ). \nThe Bcl-  2 is a family of proteins regulating apoptosis, by either in -\nhibiting (anti-  apoptotic) or inducing (pro-  apoptotic) apoptosis. The \nin vitro studies have shown that the amount of Bcl-  2 in the treated \ncells with ginger has decreased, while Bax protein has increased. In \naddition, several in vitro studies examined the role of proliferative \nfactors and MMPs (Choudhury et al., 2010 ; Ishiguro et al., 2007 ; Ling \net al., 2010 ; Ramachandran, Quirin, et al., 2015 ; Rhode et al., 2007 ). \nMMPs have been implicated as possible mediators of invasion and \nmetastasis in some cancers (Kim et al., 2014 ). Although different \ncell lines were used, this proves that in a variety of conditions, cell \nculture results in vitro models are similar and reliable but the het -\nerogeneity of the study design is a limitation, which could make the \nstudies difficult to compare. Also, there is a great variety of studies \non different cancer cells. These data are an efficient tool for an indi -\ncation of the anticancer role of ginger.\nThe results of in vitro studies showed that ginger and its deriva -\ntives have a high ability to induce apoptosis in a wide range of can -\ncer cells ( Figure  2). Now the question arises, are the results obtained under cell culture conditions transferable to clinical trials? Danwilai \net al. showed that ginger significantly increased superoxide dis -\nmutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced/oxidized glu -\ntathione in people with colorectal cancer. An increase in all of these \nenzymes has been associated with a reduction in inflammation, which \nplays a vital role in cancer control. Ginger interferes with several cell-  \nsignaling pathways that are important in the early development of \ncancer. In vitro studies showed that ginger has a powerful role in in -\nhibiting COXs. These enzymes  are responsible for the formation of \nthromboxane and prostaglandins from arachidonic acid (Ogunwobi \net al., 2012). Nonsteroidal anti-  inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as \naspirin  exert their effects through the inhibition of COX. One of the \nprimary effectors of COX-  dependent mechanisms in carcinogenesis \nis likely to be prostaglandins in particular PGE2. This prostaglandin in -\ncreased cellular proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, promotes \nangiogenesis, induces resistance to apoptosis, and modulates cellu -\nlar and humoral immunity (Greenhough et al., 2009 ). Aspirin's most \nwell-  characterized pharmacologic activity is the permanent modifi -\ncation of the COX enzymes (Patrono et al., 2005 ; Sankaranarayanan \net al., 2020 ). There is also a non-  COX-  related pathway that might \nmediate aspirin's anticancer effects by suppressing nuclear factor \nkappa B (NF-  \u03baB) expression (Fu et al., 2019 ).\nSeveral studies revealed that ginger inhibited 5-  LOX, COX-  1, and \nCOX-  2 (Rondanelli et al., 2020 ; Shukla & Singh, 2007 ). RCTs stud -\nied by Jiang et al., and M. Zick et al. showed that ginger decreased \nthe amount of COX-  1 expression in the colonic mucosa of humans \nat increased risk of colorectal cancer. The ginger had an inhibitory \neffect on COX-  1, 5-  LOX, 12-  LOX, and 15-  LOX-  2 enzymes. Also, re -\nsults showed a significant decrease in PGE-  2, PGE-  5, PGE-  12, and 15-  \nHETE normalized to arachidonic acid (Rhode et al., 2007 ). PGE-  2, as \na product of COX, induces resistance to apoptosis and increases cel -\nlular proliferation. Danwilai et al. showed that ginger significantly in -\ncreased SOD, CAT, GPx, and GSH/GSSG (Danwilai et al., 2017 ). These \nresults confirm that ginger has anti-  inflammatory effects in patients \nwith colorectal cancer (Rondanelli et al., 2020 ; Shukla & Singh, 2007 ).\nTo identify the more precise anticancer mechanisms of ginger, \nCitronberg et al. analyzed molecular pathways and key factors, \nincluding Bax, Bcl-  2, p21, hTERT, and MIB-  1 (Ki-  67) in colorectal \ncrypts using automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative \nFIGURE 2\u2003The effect of ginger on cancer cell biomarkers in clinical trials and cell culture.

The results were contrary \nto the results of in vitro studies. They showed that Bax increased \nin recipients of ginger, but results not show a change in Bcl2 and \np21. However, p21 is a potent inducer of differentiation in intesti -\nnal colonocytes. It has been reported that the expression of Bax in \nthe early stages of tumorigenesis in the colon is reduced, and ab -\nnormalities in p21 expression have been linked to carcinogenesis \n(Pryczynicz et al., 2014 ; Shukla & Singh, 2007 ). It should be noted \nthat the studies were conducted on people at risk of colorec -\ntal cancer and not on people with colorectal cancer (Citronberg \net al., 2013 ; Jiang et al., 2013 ; Zick et al., 2011 ; Zick et al., 2015 ). \nSomehow, these individuals do not have abnormal biomarkers and \ntheir biomarkers are in normal condition, in other words, if Bcl2 \nand p21 have not increased, also we should not expect molecu -\nlar markers to change in these individuals. A remarkable point in \nthese studies is that the amount of proliferative factors, such as \nhTERT and MIB-  1 (Ki-  67), has been significantly reduced. But the \ninteresting tip is that ginger has been able to reduce hTERT and \nMIB-  1 (Ki-  67) in these individuals. A decrease in hTERT expres -\nsion is consistent with previous reports, which found that gin -\nger inhibited hTERT and c-  Myc expression in human lung cancer \ncells (Tuntiwechapikul et al.,  2010 ). Oncogenes activate hTERT, \nwhile tumor suppressor p53 inhibits cancerous cell growth (Kyo \net al., 2008 ). The MIB-  1 (Ki-  67) protein is a cellular marker for the \nproliferation of cells. It is strictly associated with cell prolifera -\ntion (Cuylen et al., 2016 ). However, factor MIB-  1 (Ki-  67) decreased \n(Citronberg et al., 2013 ). One of the most important deficiencies in \nfive clinical trials was the lack of clarification of the quantities of \nginger derivatives in the blood. In other words, ginger derivatives \nhave not been reported in the serum. The key point is that logically \nginger may have the ability to activate or inhibit some of the path -\nways controlling cancer, and not all of them.\nThe main strength of this study was that the effect of ginger \non cancer was compared both in cell culture conditions and in ex -\nperimental conditions. In addition, this study was that each cancer \nmarker was carefully analyzed in both conditions. One of the limita -\ntions of this study was that the number of clinical trial studies was \nnot large and there is a need to investigate the effect of ginger on \ncolorectal cancer in different places. Another limitation of this study \nwas that the components of ginger in the serum of people were not \ninvestigated. If ginger compounds are measured in the serum of peo -\nple, the effect of digestion and absorption on its consumption will be \ndetermined. Also, one of the significant drawbacks of the clinical tri -\nals studied was that none of these trials measured ginger derivatives \nin blood serum. Somehow, ginger and its derivatives are probably \nmetabolized in the body so its effects are contradictory.\n5\u2003|\u2003CONCLUSION\nIn vitro studies consistently showed the beneficial effect of ginger \non the treatment and prevention of cancer cells in cell culture mod -\nels, but the results of clinical trials do not justify these results. The results obtained from clinical trials have inconsistent. In part of clini -\ncal trial studies, the anticancer effect of ginger has been proven, and \nin the other part, this hypothesis has been rejected. This indicated \nthat ginger may play a role in the prevention and treatment of can -\ncer, but this is not a dominant role.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors of the present research appreciate the spiritual and \nfinancial support of the research committee of the Kermanshah \nUniversity of Medical Science (IR.KUMS.REC.1398.504).\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were gen -\nerated or analyzed during the current study.\nORCID\nSeyed Mostafa Nachvak  https:/ /orcid.org/0000-0002-7265-3495  \nDavood Soleimani   https:/ /orcid.org/0000-0002-9017-3743  \nMohammad Hossein Rouhani   https://orcid.\norg/0000-0003-2451-0083  \nMahsa Miryan   https:/ /orcid.org/0000-0002-1051-6911  \nREFERENCES\nAkimoto, M., Iizuka, M., Kanematsu, R., Yoshida, M., & Takenaga, K. \n(2015).
