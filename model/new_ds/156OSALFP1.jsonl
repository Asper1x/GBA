We provide insights into the \napplication of the Automated Self- Administered 24- Hour \nDietary Assessment Tool (ASA24) for this population, and \nreport on lessons learned from carrying out participant \nrecruitment during the COVID- 19 pandemic.\nMethods Thirty- three Chinese American adults (mean \nage=40; 36% male) were recruited from the community \nand through ResearchMatch. Participants completed the \nDRS and two 24- hour food records, which were entered \ninto the ASA 24- Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24) \nby community health workers (CHWs). HEI- 2015 scores \nwere calculated from each food record and an average \nscore was obtained for each participant. One- way analysis \nof variance and Spearman correlations were used to \ncompare total and component scores between the DRS \nand HEI- 2015.\nResults Mean HEI- 2015 score was 56.7/100 (SD 10.6) \nand mean DRS score was 11.8/27 (SD 4.7), with higher \nscores reflecting better and worse diets, respectively. HEI- \n2015 and DRS scores were inversely correlated (r=\u22120.43, \np<0.05). The strongest correlations were between HEI- \n2015 Total Vegetables and DRS Vegetables (r=\u22120.5, \np<0.01), HEI- 2015 Total Vegetables and Green Vegetables \n(r=\u22120.43, p=0.01) and HEI- 2015 Seafood/Plant Protein \nand DRS Fish (r=\u22120.47, p<0.01). The inability to advertise \nand recruit for the study in person at community centres \ndue to pandemic restrictions impeded the recruitment of \nless- acculturated individuals. A lack of cultural food items \nin the ASA24 database made it difficult to record dietary \nintake as reported by participants.\nConclusion The DRS can be a valuable tool for physicians \nto identify and reach Chinese Americans at risk of \ncardiometabolic disease.\nINTRODUCTION\nPoor dietary habits are associated with many \nrisk factors for cardiometabolic disease \n(CMD), such as heart disease, stroke and \ntype 2 diabetes,1 and data on dietary choices \ncan provide important information to guide \ndiscussions of disease risk.2 Brief dietary \nassessment tools can help identify individuals \nthat may benefit from behavioural interven-\ntions to promote healthy lifestyle changes, \nwhich in turn may prevent diseases associated with poor diets. Such instruments may be \nuseful in clinical and research settings where \nmore detailed measures are not necessary or \nappropriate.\nCardiovascular, cerebrovascular and meta-\nbolic disease disproportionately affect certain \npopulation groups. Asian Americans are \namong the fastest growing segments of the \nUS population and while rates of disease \nvary by subgroup, trends in disease rates have \nbeen stagnant or increasing over the past \ntwenty years.3 Modifiable risk factors, such \nas diet, may help reduce disease prevalence \nand mortality rates, but nutrition counsel-\nling is not routinely included in prevention \nor management of these conditions. While \nseveral short dietary assessment instru-\nments have been developed and validated \nfor the general US population,4 few, if any, \nadequately capture the wide variation in \ndietary practices among various multiethnic \npopulations. Different racial/ethnic groups \nin the US display wide variation in the prev-\nalence rates of CMDs, which may be more \nclosely associated with dietary practices than \ngenetic differences.5 Developing high- quality WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC\n \u21d2Different racial/ethnic groups in the US display \na wide variation in the prevalence rates of diet- \nassociated cardiometabolic disease. There is a need \nfor short assessment instruments that can be used \nin the clinical setting to capture the unique intake \npatterns of the Asian American population.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS\n \u21d2This study establishes the relative validity of a nine- \nitem Diet Risk Score (DRS) among Chinese American \nadults and provides insights for conducting a nutri-\ntion study in this population.\nHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, \nPRACTICE OR POLICY\n \u21d2The DRS is a brief, reliable measure that could be \na useful tool for developing targeted efforts to re-\nduce cardiometabolic risk in a historically under- \nrepresented population in public health research.\n77\nJohnston\u00a0EA, et\u00a0al. bmjnph 2023;6:e000509. doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2022-000509BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health \ntools that account for the diversity of the US population \nis critical to implementing nutrition interventions that do \nnot inadvertently widen health disparities.\nOnly two brief dietary assessment instruments exist that \nspecifically assess the dietary intake patterns of a multi-\nethnic Asian population. The first and only validated \ninstrument was developed in Singapore and consists of 37 \nquestionnaire items.2 The second is currently undergoing \nvalidation and is a 27- item culturally adapted version of \nthe Dietary Screener Questionnaire used in the National \nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).6 \nWhile both instruments make it possible to assess dietary \nintake in a shorter amount of time than a total dietary \nassessment, they may still be too time- intensive for time- \nconstrained settings, such as a doctor\u2019s office visit. It is \nestimated that a 35- item questionnaire takes about 15 min \nto complete, which may exceed the time allotted for an \nentire clinical visit in some settings.7\nIn response to the need for brief and actionable dietary \nassessment tools that could be used in clinical practice, \nJohnston and colleagues developed the nine- item Diet \nRisk Score (DRS) to quickly and reliably assess suboptimal \nintake of foods or food groups.8 The DRS was validated \nin US adults recruited through ResearchMatch against a \nfood frequency questionnaire scored using the Healthy \nEating Index (HEI)- 2015, a comprehensive measure of \ndiet quality based on the 2015\u20132020 Dietary Guidelines \nfor Americans. The DRS took individuals less than 3 min \nto complete on average in the validation study. The aim \nof this study is to evaluate the relative validity of the DRS \namong Chinese Americans using HEI- 2015 scores calcu-\nlated from food record data. We hypothesised that the \ntwo measures would be inversely correlated. We used the \nAutomated Self- Administered 24- Hour (ASA24) Dietary \nAssessment Tool to obtain and automatically code food \nrecords. Here, we provide insights into its application as a \nself- administered tool for this population. We also report \non lessons learned from carrying out participant recruit-\nment procedures while under COVID- 19 pandemic \nrestrictions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTranslation of the DRS questionnaire into simplified Chinese\nThe development of the DRS has been described else-\nwhere.8 Briefly, the DRS is a nine- item questionnaire that \nestimates dietary risk for CMD based on a comparative \nrisk assessment model that was developed using NHANES \ndata and data from meta- analyses of previously published \ncohort studies to estimate diet\u2013disease relationships \n1 (questionnaire available in online supplemental \nappendix 1). The DRS assesses the dietary components \nthat contribute most to cardiometabolic risk: excess \nintake of sodium, processed meats and sugar- sweetened \nbeverages, and inadequate intake of fruits, vegetables, \nnuts and marine omega- 3 fatty acids. The DRS assesses \nintake with the following question: \u2018For the following \nfoods, please select the frequency that best describes how often you eat each food or group of foods in a normal \nweek\u2019. Participants have the option to choose \u2018daily\u2019, \n\u20182\u20133 times per week\u2019, \u20181 time per week\u2019 and \u2018never\u2019. Each \nanswer is assigned a score of 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest), for \na maximum risk score of 27. The final score is divided \ninto tertiles of risk: 0\u20138 for low risk; 9\u201318 for moderate \nrisk; 19\u201327 for high risk.\nThe translation of the DRS into simplified Chinese \ninvolved several rounds of review. The initial translation \nwas completed by a bilingual CHW at the NYU Centre for \nthe Study of Asian American Health (CSAAH). The trans-\nlated document was reviewed by another bilingual CHW \nand sent back to the first CHW with comments. The first \nCHW reviewed and integrated the comments into the \noriginal translated document and sent the updated docu-\nment to two bilingual study team members for further \nreview. On receiving the two reviewers\u2019 comments, the \nfirst CHW finalised the document for use in the study.\nRecruitment\nThe eligibility criteria were: adults 18 years of age or \nolder; self- identifying as Chinese American or Chinese \nimmigrant; being able to speak and read in English or \nMandarin (Simplified Chinese); and having access to a \ncomputer or tablet with internet and email.\nFrom January to August 2021, participants were \nrecruited from the community through the NYU CSAAH \nnetwork and ResearchMatch, an online database for \nresearch volunteers ( researchmatch. org). Potential \nparticipants were sent emails with study information and \na weblink to the study\u2019s screening questionnaire inquiring \nabout basic demographics such as age on REDCap, a \nsecure survey platform.9 10 Eligible and interested partic-\nipants provided electronic informed consent and were \nsubsequently emailed a link to the DRS questionnaire \non REDCap. Participants received a US$30 electronic \nAmazon gift card to acknowledge their contributions to \nthe project.\nASA24 Dietary Assessment\nDietary intake data were obtained using the ASA24 \nDietary Assessment Tool, a web- based tool developed by \nthe National Cancer Institute that enables automatically \ncoded 24- hour dietary recalls and food diaries.4 While the \nASA24 is intended to be a self- administered tool, the study \nteam\u2019s prior experience with the web- based platform indi-\ncated that non- English speakers and those with low health \nor technology literacy may find it difficult to navigate.11 12 \nRather than having participants complete food records \non the online ASA24 platform directly, participants were \nprovided paper- based material (ie, a food diary template \ndocument with instructions and a food measurements \nguide document) to complete written food diaries.\nParticipants completed 2 days of food diaries, one on \na weekday and one a weekend day. No questions were \nasked regarding whether the data represented usual \nintake. Completed food diaries were sent to the study \nteam via email. A research assistant inputted data from \n78\nJohnston\u00a0EA, et\u00a0al. bmjnph 2023;6:e000509. doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2022-000509 BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health\nparticipants\u2019 written food diaries into the ASA24 plat-\nform and took note of any additional information that \nwas required by the system. Any missing information was \nthen collected during phone interviews with participants. \nAs per study design, all participants completed phone \ninterviews.\nTests of validity\nIn order to determine whether the DRS could accurately \nidentify individuals with poor diet quality, the DRS was \ncompared with participants\u2019 HEI- 2015 scores calculated \nusing data from participants\u2019 ASA24 food records. The \nHEI- 2015 is a measure of diet quality used to evaluate the \nextent to which Americans are following key recommen-\ndations from the 2015\u20132020 Dietary Guidelines for Amer -\nicans.13 Evaluations of the HEI- 2015 have demonstrated \nconstruct validity, reliability and criterion validity.14\nStatistical Analysis\nASA24 data were reviewed and cleaned per recommended \nprocedures.4 Average HEI- 2015 scores were derived for \neach participant. Descriptive statistics (means and SDs) \nwere computed for demographic and HEI- 2015 compo-\nnents. One- way analysis of variance was used to determine \nstatistical difference between DRS and HEI- 2015 total \nscores. Spearman correlations were used to measure level \nof agreement between DRS and HEI- 2015 component \nscores. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to compare \nthe DRS and HEI- 2015 scores using a single day of the \nASA24. A power calculation indicated that a sample of 30 \nindividuals would provide 80% power at an alpha level of \n0.05 to detect a minimum acceptable correlation coeffi-\ncient of r=0.50 between the two tests.15 Data analysis was \nconducted using SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute).16\nRESULTS\nIndividuals that completed both the DRS and ASA24 study \ncomponents were included in the analyses. Twenty- two \nparticipants (67%) were recruited from the commu-\nnity by emailing study flyers to contacts of study team \nmembers and using snowball sampling. ResearchMatch \nrecruitment emails were sent to 500 individuals that \nhad \u2018Asian American\u2019 as their race/ethnicity. Of those, \n24 individuals signed informed consent forms, 13 indi-\nviduals partially completed the surveys and food diaries, \nand 11 participants (33%) completed all assessments and \nwere included in the study. Energy and nutrient ranges \nfell within range for all participants, so no participants \nthat completed both study components were excluded \nfrom the analysis.17\nMean age of participants was 40 (range 21\u201362 years), \nand 36% were male. The average DRS score of respon-\ndents was 11.8 (SD 4.7) out of a maximum score of 27 \n(lower score represents lower risk), and the average HEI- \n2015 score was 56.7 (SD 10.6) out of 100 (higher score \nrepresents higher diet quality) (table 1). For modera-\ntion components, the average HEI component score for sodium was 2.2 out of 10, saturated fat 6.1 out of 10 and \nadded sugars 8.8 out of 10.\nEach of the DRS components had variation in \nresponses, with the exception that no participant \nreported consuming vegetables less than 2\u20133 times per \nweek (table 2). Mean HEI- 2015 score did not differ \nsignificantly by tertile of DRS (table 3).\nThe DRS Vegetables component correlated moderately \nwith HEI- 2015 Total Vegetables and Greens and Beans \ncomponents (r=\u22120.50, \u20130.43 respectively, both p\u22640.01) \n(table 4). The DRS Fish component correlated moder -\nately with the HEI- 2015 Seafood/Plant Protein compo-\nnent (r=\u22120.47, p=0.006). Analyses were repeated using a \nsingle day of ASA- 24, and results were similar (data not \nshown).\nDISCUSSION\nTotal DRS scores were moderately, inversely correlated \nwith total HEI- 2015 scores derived from the ASA24 \n(r=\u22120.43, p<0.05) for a sample of Chinese American \nadults recruited from the community and ResearchMatch \n. DRS Vegetables correlated moderately with the HEI- \n2015 Total Vegetables (r=\u22120.5, p<0.01) and Green Vegeta-\nbles (r=\u22120.43, p=0.01) components.

DRS Nuts also correlated \nmoderately with the HEI- 2015 Seafood/Plant Protein \ncomponent but the results were not significant.\nThere were no correlations between DRS Fruit and \nthe HEI- 2015 Total Fruit (includes juice) or Whole \nFruit (excludes juice) components (r=\u22120.16, p=0.38 and \nr=\u22120.05, p=0.79, respectively). In the original validation \nstudy by Johnston et al,8 these were among the strongest \ncorrelations between the DRS and HEI- 2015, with r=\u22120.67 \nfor DRS Total Fruit and r=\u22120.68 for DRS Whole Fruit at \np<0.001. Poor agreement may have been due to discrep-\nancies in the responses provided by participants on the \ntwo self- report measures and differences in the way the \nASA24 and DRS capture fruit intake. The DRS assesses \nfruit intake in a normal week: \u2018fruit (fresh, canned or \ndried; not including juice)\u2019 quantified only by \u2018daily\u2019, \n\u20182\u20133 times per week\u2019, \u20181 time per week\u2019 and \u2018never\u2019. The \nASA24 collects data on all foods and drinks eaten by \nparticipants over a 24- hour period and tabulates intake of \nfoods that are coded as fruits in the database.18\nConsistent with findings from the original vali-\ndation study, correlations with sodium intake were non- significant. Sodium intake is difficult to accurately \ncapture without the use of a 24- hour urinary assessment.19 \nThe DRS does not attempt to quantify sodium intake, and \ninstead provides a score based on intake of four categories \n(fast food, breads, snacks and processed meats) related \nto intake of the major sources of sodium in the Amer -\nican diet, processed and restaurant food; breads, rolls \nand sandwiches; salty snacks.20 The lowest HEI compo-\nnent score was for sodium, just 2.2 out of 10 possible \npoints, indicating that sodium intake was contributing to \nthe lower HEI scores. Future iterations of the DRS may \nbenefit from consideration of the variance in sources of \nsodium intake by race/ethnicity. For example, salt added \nat home (in cooking and at the table) and soy sauce are \nthe largest dietary sources of sodium in East Asian popu-\nlations.21 A 2017 study by Firestone et al reported that \nthe top 10 sources of sodium for Asian Americans as an \naggregate were: (1) soups, (2) rice, (3) yeast breads, (4) \nstir- fry and soy- based sauces, (5) fish, (6) chicken (whole \npieces), (7) fried rice and lo/chow mein, (8) soy- based \ncondiments, (9) pizza and (10) dips, gravies and other \nsauces.22\nNevertheless, the DRS can be used to initiate a discus-\nsion of the impact of dietary choices on CMD. The inclu-\nsion of discussion of adverse influence of high sodium \nintake on blood pressure may be particularly salient for \nAsian Americans, who have the highest intake of sodium \namong racial/ethnic groups. Analysis of data from \nNHANES 2011\u20132012 by Bailey et al showed that only 8% \nof non- Hispanic Asian Americans consumed the recom-\nmended amount of sodium (\u22642300 mg/day), compared \nwith 13%, 16% and 12% of non- Hispanic whites, non- \nHispanic blacks and Hispanics, respectively.23 In NHANES \n2015\u20132016, non- Hispanic Asians had the lowest mean Table 2 Diet Risk Score component responses\nDaily 2\u20133 times per week 1 time per week Never\nFast food Sit- down or take- out meals, frozen dinners or other fast \nfood type meals, including pizza*2 9 14 8\nBreads Bread, rolls, sandwiches* 8 12 9 4\nSnacks Chips, popcorn, pretzels, snack mixes, crackers* 7 8 14 4\nProcessed meats Sausage, cured or deli meat, hot dogs\u2020 1 4 21 7\nSugar- sweetened \nbeveragesRegular soda, sweetened iced tea, juice, flavoured milk \nor flavoured coffee drinks\u20213 5 12 13\nNuts Peanuts, tree nuts, seeds, peanut butter or other nut \nbutter\u00a75 12 12 4\nFish Fish or shellfish\u00b6 2 13 13 5\nVegetables Vegetables (not including potatoes, peas, corn or \nbeans)**26 7 0 0\nFruit Fruit\u2020\u2020 17 12 3 1\n*Serving information and rationale for score of 3 (high risk): sodium >2300 mg per day.\n\u2020Serving information and rationale for score of 3 (high risk): Processed meat >2 ounces per day.\n\u2021Serving information and rationale for score of 3 (high risk): sugar- sweetened beverages >8 ounces per day.\n\u00a7Serving information and rationale for score of 3 (high risk): low nuts/seeds <1 ounce per week.\n\u00b6Serving information and rationale for score of 3 (high risk): seafood <100 mg omega- 3 fats per day.\n**Serving Information and rationale for score of 3 (high risk): low vegetables <100 g or <1 serving per day.\n\u2020\u2020Serving information and rationale for score of 3 (high risk): low fruit <100 g or <1 serving per day.\nTable 3 Mean HEI- 2015 score by Diet Risk Score (DRS) \ncategory\nDRS score Mean HEI- 2015 score (SD)* n\n1\u20138 (low risk) 61.1 (11.8) 8\n9\u201317 (moderate risk) 55.7 (9.8) 22\n18\u201327 (high risk) 52.1 (12.7) 3\n*Data presented as means (SD) from one- way ANOVA, p=0.35.\nANOVA, analysis of variance; HEI, Healthy Eating Index.\n80\nJohnston\u00a0EA, et\u00a0al. bmjnph 2023;6:e000509. doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2022-000509 BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health\nscore on the HEI- 2015 sodium component (0.6 out of \n10) compared with Hispanics (4.0), non- Hispanic whites \n(3.9) and non- Hispanic blacks (4.1).24 Excessive sodium \nintake is associated with hypertension and mortality due \nto CMD.1 Such data strongly support the need to create \nand refine dietary screeners for the Asian American \npopulation, including those that can inform and engage \nhealthcare providers in a clinical setting.\nLess than 25% of patients receive any dietary assess-\nment or nutrition counselling from a physician,25 but \nphysicians can play a key role in helping patients improve \ndiet quality,26 particularly in the Chinese American \ncommunity. In a US study assessing trust in physicians \namong 3159 community- dwelling Chinese older adults, \nparticipants displayed high levels of trust in physicians\u2019 \nknowledge and skills.27 In traditional Chinese culture, the \nbenevolent intent of physicians is emphasised, and physi-\ncians are socially respected, considered to possess special \nknowledge and expertise, and deemed highly capable.28 29 \nGiven that current dietary public health messaging falls \nshort of reaching Asian Americans at risk of CMD, physi-\ncians can occupy a highly impactful role in mitigating \ndisease risk among Chinese Americans through lifestyle \nchange. Short and actionable screening tools, such as \nthe DRS, can help physicians start the conversation by \naddressing previously cited knowledge and time barriers \nto providing nutritional counselling.30 31\nAn analysis of diet quality based on NHANES data \nshowed that Asian Americans perceived their diet quality \nmore accurately than other ethnic groups when asked to \nreport how healthy their dietary intake is.32 Those with the \nhighest self- rated diet quality had higher HEI Total Fruits, \nWhole Fruits, Added Sugars and Saturated Fats compo-\nnent scores than those with lower self- rated diet quality. \nAdditionally, higher intake of fruit has been associated with lower BMI and waist circumference in Asian Amer -\nicans, but these associations are not significant among \ntotal HEI score, just component scores.33\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to this study. We used a \ncomparison between two dietary self- report methods. \nSuch methods are prone to inaccuracies due to imper -\nfect memory and social desirability bias, which leads to \nunder- reporting of energy intake.34 35 We did not collect \ndata on subject characteristics apart from age and sex, \nand we report them here only to describe the sample; this \nprecludes subgroup analyses.\nAnother limitation is the small, mostly female, sample \n(n=33) and lack of generalisability due to eligibility criteria \nrequiring access to internet and email. Due to challenges \nbrought on by the COVID- 19 pandemic, recruitment \nwas slow and original plans to do in- person community- \nbased recruitment were not feasible. While the study is \nsufficiently powered with the current sample size, we had \ndifficulty recruiting a majority of participants to be less \nacculturated individuals from the community as we had \ninitially planned. Despite offering the study in Mandarin \nChinese, using CHWs with strong ties to the community, \nand recruiting through the NYU CSAAH, a National \nInstitutes of Health National Institute on Minority Health \nand Health Disparities\u2012funded centre with extensive \nexperience in conducting research in the Asian Amer -\nican community, we were limited by our inability to use \nin- person recruitment tactics through community organi-\nsations. Therefore, the participants included in the study \nwere more likely to speak English and had a higher level \nof digital literacy than our intended sample.

We suspect that the consequence of this oversight \nwould be listing someone\u2019s risk as higher than it truly is by \nnot counting certain foods that are protective. The extent \nto which this impacted the current study is unclear, but \nlikely small.\nFinally, the lack of culturally appropriate food items \non the ASA24 made it difficult to report dietary intake \nas provided by participants. Because we anticipated \nrecruiting participants from the community who might \nexperience language, technology and health literacy \nbarriers, food records were initially collected on paper \nby participants and entered into the system by trained \nCHWs. In a postrecruitment interview, one CHW stated \nthat she often had to resort to recipe- building by entering \nin individual ingredients one- by- one, a process that \nwas time- consuming, frequently required substitutions \nand missed the \u2018flavour\u2019 of traditional Chinese dishes \n(Chinese cooking incorporates many sauces that were \nmissing on the ASA24). She felt that having prior knowl-\nedge of the limitations of the platform through practice \nruns was necessary to ensure that the most accurate record \nwas inputted for participants eating a traditional Chinese \ndiet. This would not be possible if participants were \ncompleting their food records directly on the ASA24. We \nsearched for all of the items that the CHWs highlighted \nas absent from ASA24 and 78% of them were also not \navailable in another validated resource, Nutrition Data \nSystem for Research 2022 (Minneapolis, Minnesota). In \nthe absence of more culturally relevant platforms, future \nstudies using the ASA24 (or other dietary recall systems) \nfor a Chinese American population should consider \nusing a similar approach of having a trained individual \nenter data. It is recommended to include a CHW or other \nindividual with knowledge and experience pertinent to \nthe specific population in the planning of future studies, \nwhich may help to reduce some of these barriers.\nCONCLUSION\nThe DRS is a brief, reliable measure that could be a useful \ntool in clinical practice. This tool is an important first step \nto developing targeted efforts to reduce cardiometabolic \nrisk in a population that has historically been under- \nrepresented in public health research. Studies inclusive \nof older populations and more recent immigrants would \naid in the development of a more valid measure. The orig-\ninal DRS has been tested in clinical practice (manuscript \nunder review); planned studies include translation of \nthe DRS into Spanish and validation in Spanish- speaking \npopulations. In low- resource settings, medical nutrition \ntherapy and other lifestyle interventions may be difficult \nto access. Creation of DRS cut points for clinical action, \nsuch as referral to a registered dietitian nutritionist or to a lifestyle change programme such as a Diabetes Preven-\ntion Programme would also contribute to the utility of \nthis tool to identify at risk individuals for meaningful use \nof sparse resources to contribute to CMD risk reduction.\nContributors Conceptualisation, EJ and JB; methodology, all authors; formal \nanalysis, JB and AP; writing\u2014EJ, JB and AP review and editing, all authors; \nsupervision, JB; project administration, AP; translation and community resources, \nLH.
