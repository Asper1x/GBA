However, it is also important that a transition away\nfrom animal-derived foods does not lead to any adverse nutritional effects. In this study, the potential\nof blending whey protein isolate (WPI) with either shiitake mushroom (SM) or oyster mushroom (OM)\nto create hybrid foods with enhanced nutritional and physicochemical properties was investigated.\nThe impact of OM or SM addition on the formation, microstructure, and physicochemical attributes\nof heat-set whey protein gels was therefore examined. The mushroom powders were used because\nthey have relatively high levels of vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and dietary fibers, which may\nprovide nutritional benefits, whereas the WPI was used to provide protein and good thermal gelation\nproperties. A variety of analytical methods were used to characterize the structural and physicochem-\nical properties of the WPI-mushroom hybrids, including confocal microscopy, particle electrophoresis,\nlight scattering, proximate analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis,\ndynamic shear rheology, textural profile analysis, and colorimetry. The charge on whey proteins\nand mushroom particles went from positive to negative when the pH was raised from 3 to 9, but\nwhey protein had a higher isoelectric point and charge magnitude. OM slightly increased the thermal\nstability of WPI, but SM had little effect. Both mushroom types decreased the lightness and increased\nthe brownness of the whey protein gels. The addition of the mushroom powders also decreased\nthe hardness and Young\u2019s modulus of the whey protein gels, which may be because the mushroom\nparticles acted as soft fillers. This study provides valuable insights into the formation of hybrid whey\nprotein-mushroom products that have desirable physiochemical and nutritional attributes.\nKeywords: whey protein isolate; mushrooms; rheology; hybrid foods; sustainable foods\n1. Introduction\nRecently, there has been considerable concern about the adverse effects of livestock\nproduction on the environment, including relatively high levels of greenhouse gas emis-\nsions, pollution, freshwater use, land use, and biodiversity [ 1,2]. For this reason, there\nhas been interest in switching to a diet that includes alternative sources of protein, such\nas those derived from plants, insects, fungi, precision fermentation, or cultured animal\ncells [ 3,4]. However, it is often challenging to simulate the desirable sensorial and nutri-\ntional attributes of animal-derived products, like meat, egg, or dairy products, using a single\nsource of alternative proteins [ 5,6]. In particular, it has proved challenging to accurately mimic\nthe appearance, texture, mouthfeel, flavor, and nutrient profile of animal-derived products\nusing only a single type of alternative proteins. For this reason, there is interest in creating\nhybrid food products that combine protein-rich ingredients from different sources, such as\nanimals, plants, insects, fungi, precision fermentation, or cultured animal cells, to enhance the\nsensory and nutritional properties of foods, while also improving their sustainability [ 7\u20139].\nGels 2024 ,10, 446. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels10070446 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2024 ,10, 446 2 of 18\nThese hybrid products can reduce the proportion of animal-derived foods in the human\ndiet, while still having beneficial sensorial and nutritional attributes. Nevertheless, the\ntypes and amounts of the different types of ingredients used to formulate a hybrid food\nmust be optimized to obtain a final product with the desired properties.\nIn this study, we focused on creating meat analogs by fabricating hybrid foods consist-\ning of milk proteins and powdered mushrooms. Whey protein isolate (WPI) is a mixture\nof globular proteins that are normally isolated and purified from the whey fraction of\nmilk [ 10]. Powdered WPI is used as a multifunctional ingredient in the food industry\ndue to its good gelling, binding, foaming, emulsifying, and nutritional properties [ 11].\nUnlike many plant proteins, whey protein has adequate levels of all the essential amino\nacids required to maintain human health and wellbeing [ 12]. One of the most important\nfunctional attributes of whey proteins are their ability to form irreversible heat-set gels\nwhen heated above their thermal denaturation temperature [ 10]. Under these conditions,\nthe globular whey proteins unfold and expose non-polar groups on their surfaces, which\nstrengthens the hydrophobic attraction between them. As a result, they may associate\nwith each other and form a 3D network mainly held together by hydrophobic, disulfide,\nand hydrogen bonding [ 13]. The microstructure, appearance, rheology, and fluid hold-\ning properties of these gels are strongly influenced by protein concentration, as well as\npH, ionic strength, and heating conditions, as these factors influence the nature of the\naggregates formed [ 14,15]. Whey proteins are therefore useful functional ingredients for\ncreating nutritious foods with textural attributes that can somewhat mimic those of meat\nproducts [ 16,17]. Nevertheless, the raising of dairy cattle to produce milk is still damaging\nto the environment [ 18], and so it would be advantageous to reduce the amounts of whey\nprotein used in these products. Moreover, many bioactive substances are lacking from\nwhey proteins, such as dietary fibers and nutraceuticals.\nMushrooms are a sustainable and nutritious food source that are rich in health-\npromoting bioactive substances [ 19,20]. Shiitake mushrooms ( Lentinula edodes ) are one\nof the most common types of edible mushrooms consumed commercially [ 21]. They have\na high nutritional value because they are abundant in vitamins (niacin, pro-vitamin D 2,\nvitamin B 1, B2, B6, and B 12) and minerals (potassium, manganese, magnesium, iron, and\nphosphorus), as well as bioactive substances such as dietary fiber, ergosterol, and natural\nantioxidants [ 22]. Oyster mushrooms ( Pleurotus ostreatus ) are also commonly consumed\naround the world because of their desirable flavor, nutrient content, and therapeutic\nqualities. Indeed, they have been reported to exhibit antidiabetic [ 23], antibacterial [ 24],\nantiviral [ 25], antioxidant [ 26], anticancer [ 27], and cholesterol-lowering properties [ 28],\nwhich have been attributed to the broad range of bioactive substances they contain [ 26]. If\nnot consumed directly, mushrooms can be converted into a powdered form, which reduces\nwaste, extends their shelf life, and facilitates storage and transport [ 29]. These powdered\nmushroom ingredients may be useful additives for improving nutritional properties and\naltering the physicochemical and functional properties of whey proteins. Researchers have\nshown that incorporating powdered mushrooms into meat emulsions enhanced their nutri-\ntional profile, promoted the formation of a finer emulsion, and increased gel strength [ 30].\nOther researchers reported that the incorporation of powdered mushrooms into a fish\nmeat formulation could inhibit lipid oxidation due to the antioxidant agents within the\nmushrooms [ 30]. Other researchers have examined the impact of mushroom powder ad-\ndition on the properties of chicken [ 31], beef [ 32], pork [ 33], and goat [ 34] products. Due\nto their desirable nutritional, sensory, and functional attributes, mushroom powders are\nparticularly suitable for formulating hybrid meat analogs [35].\nGels 2024 ,10, 446 3 of 18\nThe objective of this research was therefore to characterize the impact of shiitake\nmushroom (SM) and oyster mushroom (OM) powders on the structural and physico-\nchemical properties of whey protein gels. It was hypothesized that incorporation of the\nmushroom powders would alter the appearance, texture, and fluid holding properties of\nthe whey protein gels, which may be beneficial for creating hybrid meat analogs. More-\nover, the incorporation of the mushroom powders should improve the nutritional and\nsensory attributes of the meat analogs [ 36]. For this reason, we examined the impact of\nincorporating SM or OM into whey protein gels on their structural and physicochemi-\ncal properties using a variety of analytical methods, including microscopy, calorimetry,\ngravimetry, electrophoresis, rheology, and colorimetry. The knowledge gained from this\nstudy may facilitate the development of hybrid alternative protein products with enhanced\nsensorial and nutritional attributes.\n2. Results and Discussion\n2.1. Mushroom Powder Composition\nThe proximate compositions of the two mushroom samples used in the current study\nwere the same as those reported in our previous research [ 37]. Briefly, the carbohydrate,\nprotein, moisture, ash, and fat contents of the SM were 67.1, 14.6, 9.8, 5.6, and 3.0%\n(w/w) respectively, while those of the OM were 60.4, 17.1, 11.6, 5.9, and 5.0% ( w/w),\nrespectively. The proximate analysis therefore indicates that the majority of the mushroom\npowders was carbohydrates, which is a mixture of digestible carbohydrates such as starches,\nglycogen, and sugars [ 38], as well as indigestible carbohydrates such as chitin, \u03b2-glucans,\nhemicellulose, and pectin [39].\n2.2. Thermogravimetric Analysis\nInformation about the thermal behavior of the powdered whey protein and mushroom\nsamples was obtained by measuring the decrease in their mass during controlled heat-\ning using thermogravimetric analysis (Figure 1a). The gradient of the mass change with\ntemperature change (d m/dT) was calculated from this data to identify the temperature\nranges where the major thermal events occurred (Figure 1b). For all samples, there was\na pronounced decrease in mass during heating from around 30 and 120\u25e6C, which can be\nattributed to evaporation of some of the water molecules associated with the powders. At\n120\u25e6C (after this thermal event was complete), the mass loss of the samples was around 6.8,\n10.3, and 10.5% ( w/w) for the WPI, OM, and SM powders, respectively, which was probably\nbecause they initially contained different amounts of water. There was another pronounced\ndecrease in mass for all samples between 210 and 360\u25e6C, which was probably due to\nthermal degradation of organic compounds, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and other\nsubstances. Indeed, other researchers have reported that WPI undergoes thermal decom-\nposition over a similar temperature range, which was attributed to breakage of covalent\npeptide bonds and cleavage of S-S, O-N, and O-O bonds at higher temperatures [ 40]. Other\nresearchers have reported similar TGA curves for powdered mushrooms (shitake) analyzed\nby thermogravimetric analysis, which were also attributed to moisture evaporation at lower\ntemperatures and thermal degradation of organic matter at higher temperatures [ 41]. At the\nend of the TGA experiments (800\u25e6C), there were slight differences in the residual masses:\n19.5, 25.8, and 22.1% ( w/w) for the WPI, OM, and SM powders, respectively. This effect\nmay have been because they contained different kinds of minerals and mineral compounds\nformed during the heating process, as these components have a low volatility and therefore\ntend to remain after the samples have been heated at high temperatures [42].\nGels 2024 ,10, 446 4 of 18\nGels 2024 , 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 18  \n  \n(a) ( b) \nFigure 1.

Zeta-Potential Analysis \nThe whey protein and/or mushroom powders were then dispersed in aqueous \nsolutions and their electrical characteristics were determined using electrophoresis \n(Figure 2). For the WPI dispersion, the zeta potential changed from around +20 mV at pH \n3 to \u221235 mV at pH 8, with a point of zero ch arge around pH 5. The pH dependent charge \nof the WPI dispersion is because the ionizable surface groups on the whey protein surfaces \nchange from protonated ( \u2212NH 3+ and \u2212COOH) at low pH values to de-protonated ( \u2212NH 2 \nand \u2212COO\u2212) at high pH values [43]. At the isoelectric point, there is a balance of charged \namino and carboxyl groups, leading to a zero net charge [44]. For the mushroom \ndispersions (OM and SM), their zeta potential values also went from positive at low pH \nto negative at high pH, however, there were so me distinct differences in their pH behavior \ncompared to the whey proteins. First, the ma gnitude of their zeta potential was much \nlower than that of the whey proteins at both low pH values and high pH values. For \ninstance, the zeta potential of the OM and SM samples was only +6.5 and +4.4 mV at pH \n3, and \u221220.5 and \u221216.1 mV at pH 7, respectively. Second, the point of zero charge for the \nmushroom samples was appreciably below that of the whey proteins. For instance, the \nisoelectric points of the OM and SM samples were around pH 3.9 and 3.6, respectively. \nThere are several possible reasons for the different zeta potential-pH behaviors of the \nwhey proteins and mushroom particles. The WPI powder is mainly composed of pure \nproteins, whereas the mushroom powders contain a complex mixture of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and minerals. Any anionic polysaccharides (like pectin) or cationic \npolysaccharides (like chitosan) present in the mushrooms would have interacted with \noppositely charged groups on the amphoteric proteins, thereby partially neutralizing their \ncharge [45,46]. \nFigure 1.

At the isoelectric point, there is a balance of charged amino\nand carboxyl groups, leading to a zero net charge [ 44]. For the mushroom dispersions (OM\nand SM), their zeta potential values also went from positive at low pH to negative at high\npH, however, there were some distinct differences in their pH behavior compared to the\nwhey proteins.

Interestingly, however, the zeta potential values of the 1:1 hybrids were much closer to those of the pure mushroom than \nto those of the pure WPI. There are several potential reasons for this: The mushroom \npowders contained a significant amount of  minerals, which may have reduced the \nmagnitude of the zeta potential on the protei ns through electrostatic screening and/or ion \nbinding effects. Moreover, the mushroom po wders contained other components (such as \nionic dietary fibers) that may have interacted  with the proteins. In addition, the whey \nproteins and mushroom particles may have formed complexes under some pH conditions \n[45,46].  \nUnder the solution conditions used to form the heat-set gels in this study (pH 7.0), \nboth the whey proteins and mushroom powders would be expected to be negatively charged. Consequently, there should be an electrostatic repulsion between them, which \nmay impact their ability to form hybrid gels.  \n2.4.

For \nthe pure WPI solutions (15%), a single endo thermic peak was observed around 73.9 \u00b0C, \nwhich can be attributed to irreversible denaturation and aggregation of the globular \nproteins (mainly \u03b2-lactoglobulin) around this temperature [47,48]. The endothermic \nenthalpy change is a result of the energy requ ired to disrupt the intramolecular bonds that \nhold the globular proteins together in their native state, such as hydrophobic, hydrogen, \nand disulfide bonds [49].

For the pure WPI samples, the complex shear modulus versus  \ntemperature profiles showed that the protein formed viscous solutions before heating. \nDuring heating from 25 to 50 \u00b0C, there was a decrease in shear modulus, which may have \nbeen due to dissociation of whey protein aggreg ates or oligomers. From 50 to 65 \u00b0C, there \nwas a slight increase in shear modulus, which can be attributed to unfolding and \naggregation of the more thermally labile whey proteins. WPI ingredients contain a \nmixture of globular proteins with different denaturation temperatures, including \u03b2-\nlactoglobulin (72 \u00b0C), \u03b1-lactalbumin (64 \u00b0C), and bovine serum albumin (64 \u00b0C) [50]. As \nthey are typically present at the highest conc entration in whey proteins, they led to a \nstronger gel network being formed. The shea r modulus of the pure WPI gels increased \nwhen they cooled, which can mainly be attributed to strengthening of the hydrogen \nbonding between the protein molecules in the gel network. These results show that the \npure whey protein formed irreversible heat-set gels.  \nFigure 3.

The samples \nwere heated from 25 to 90 and th en cooled from 90 to 5 \u00b0C at 3 \u00b0C/min. A constant frequency (1 Hz) \nand strain (0.1%) were used.

In contrast, \nthe 10% OM and SM dispersions could be analyzed because they formed weak gels that \nwere resistant to sedimentatio n. However, their gel strength  did not change appreciably \nduring heating or cooling, as reported in ou r previous study [37]. This result suggests \nthere were no components within the pure mushroom dispersions (such as proteins or \npolysaccharides) that underwent thermal tran sitions and formed strong gel networks. \nThese results are therefore consistent with the DSC measurements discussed earlier, \nwhich also detected no thermal transitions within the mushroom samples during heating \nand cooling (Section 2.4). \nThe presence of the mushroom powders alte red the thermal gelation behavior of the \nwhey proteins. Before heating, the initial shea r modulus of the hybrid samples was higher \nthan that of the pure protein samples, which was attributed to the formation of a weak gel \nnetwork by the mushroom particles at ambient temperature. In the presence of proteins, \nthis network was relatively resistant to s edimentation and so rheology measurements \ncould be performed. For oyster mushrooms, the shear modulus decreased slightly from \n25 to 65 \u00b0C, but then increased steeply from  70 to 90 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to \nunfolding and aggregation of the whey protein molecules. In contrast, for the shitake \nmushrooms, the shear modulus decreased slight ly from 25 to 75 \u00b0C, increased moderately \nfrom 75 to 90 \u00b0C, and then continued to increa se rapidly when the sample was held at 90 \n\u00b0C. This result suggests that the presence  of the SM inhibited the unfolding and/or \naggregation of the whey proteins. The DSC re sults suggested that the presence of OM \nincreased the thermal denaturation temperature of the whey proteins, whereas the \npresence of SM had little effect (Figure 3). Taken together, these results therefore suggest \nthat SM inhibited protein aggregation rather than protein unfolding. During cooling, the \nshear modulus of both types of hybrid gels increased, which can ag ain be attributed to \nstrengthening of hydrogen bonding between the biopolymers at lower temperatures. The \nfinal shear modulus of the hybrid gels was lower than that of the whey protein gels. For instance, the final shear modulus values were 186, 65, and 38 kPa for the 15% WPI, \n15%WPI + 5%OM, and 15%WPI + 5%SM samples at 5 \u00b0C, respectively. This result also \nFigure 4. Temperature dependence of the complex shear modulus ( G*) of 15% whey protein solutions\nin the absence and presence of 5% oyster or shitake mushroom (OM or SM). The samples were heated\nfrom 25 to 90 and then cooled from 90 to 5\u25e6C at 3\u25e6C/min. A constant frequency (1 Hz) and strain\n(0.1%) were used. All solutions contained 100 mM NaCl.\nThe pure mushroom dispersions (5 or 10%) did not form strong gels upon heating.\nThe 5% OM and SM dispersions could not be analyzed because the mushroom particles\nsedimented to the bottom of the samples during the rheology measurements. In contrast,\nthe 10% OM and SM dispersions could be analyzed because they formed weak gels that\nwere resistant to sedimentation. However, their gel strength did not change appreciably\nduring heating or cooling, as reported in our previous study [ 37]. This result suggests\nthere were no components within the pure mushroom dispersions (such as proteins or\npolysaccharides) that underwent thermal transitions and formed strong gel networks.\nThese results are therefore consistent with the DSC measurements discussed earlier, which\nalso detected no thermal transitions within the mushroom samples during heating and\ncooling (Section 2.4).\nThe presence of the mushroom powders altered the thermal gelation behavior of the\nwhey proteins. Before heating, the initial shear modulus of the hybrid samples was higher\nthan that of the pure protein samples, which was attributed to the formation of a weak gel\nnetwork by the mushroom particles at ambient temperature. In the presence of proteins,\nthis network was relatively resistant to sedimentation and so rheology measurements could\nbe performed. For oyster mushrooms, the shear modulus decreased slightly from 25 to\n65\u25e6C, but then increased steeply from 70 to 90\u25e6C, which can be attributed to unfolding\nand aggregation of the whey protein molecules. In contrast, for the shitake mushrooms, the\nshear modulus decreased slightly from 25 to 75\u25e6C, increased moderately from 75 to 90\u25e6C,\nand then continued to increase rapidly when the sample was held at 90\u25e6C. This result\nsuggests that the presence of the SM inhibited the unfolding and/or aggregation of the\nwhey proteins. The DSC results suggested that the presence of OM increased the thermal\ndenaturation temperature of the whey proteins, whereas the presence of SM had little\neffect (Figure 3). Taken together, these results therefore suggest that SM inhibited protein\naggregation rather than protein unfolding. During cooling, the shear modulus of both\ntypes of hybrid gels increased, which can again be attributed to strengthening of hydrogen\nbonding between the biopolymers at lower temperatures. The final shear modulus of\nthe hybrid gels was lower than that of the whey protein gels. For instance, the final\nshear modulus values were 186, 65, and 38 kPa for the 15% WPI, 15%WPI + 5%OM, and\n15%WPI + 5%SM samples at 5\u25e6C, respectively. This result also suggests that the presence\nGels 2024 ,10, 446 8 of 18\nof the SM inhibited the aggregation of the whey protein molecules, thereby leading to a\nweaker gel network being formed. The samples containing 10% whey protein and 10%\nmushroom also showed weaker gel strengths than the ones containing only 10% whey\nprotein. In this case, the final shear modulus values were 39, 5.8, and 17 kPa for the 10%\nWPI, 10%WPI + 10%OM, and 10%WPI + 10%SM samples at 5\u25e6C, respectively. Thus, the\npresence of the OM led to weaker gels than the presence of SM for these samples. The origin\nof this difference is unknown, but our results clearly show that the mushroom particles\ninterfered with the ability of the whey proteins to form gels.\n2.6. Texture Profile Analysis\nFurther insights into the impact of the mushroom powders on the thermal gelation\nproperties of the whey proteins were obtained using compression testing. Examples of the\nsingle compression stress versus strain curves for the 10% and 15% ( w/w) whey protein\ngels with and without mushroom (to bring the total to 20% w/w) are shown in Figure 5.\nThe Young\u2019s modulus, breaking stress, and breaking strain calculated from these curves for\nall the samples tested are summarized in Table 1. For both the pure WPI gels, the stress\nincreased with increasing strain until the samples were compressed to around 60% of their\noriginal height, and then there was a steep decrease in stress, which was taken to be the\nbreaking point. For these gels, the Young\u2019s modulus, breaking stress, and breaking strain\nincreased as the protein concentration was increased. The strengthening of the WPI gels\nwith increasing protein concentration is because more denatured protein molecules can\nbe incorporated into the gel network during heating, leading to more crosslinks per unit\nsurface area, and therefore a greater resistance to compression and fracture.\nGels 2024 , 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 18  \n during compression than that of pure WPI gels.

The addition of the mushroom powders had a major impact on the \nTPA parameters of the whey protein gels, with  the effects depending on gel composition. \nFor both mushroom types, the hardness, adhesiveness, and gumminess of the hybrid gels \nwere considerably higher than those of the pure WPI gels. The increase in hardness may \nbe because the hybrid samples did not fracture during the first compression, and therefore \nprovided a greater resistance to compression at  the higher strains used. For both protein \nconcentrations, the addition of the OM gave higher hardness values than the addition of \nSM. The increase in the adhesiveness and gumminess of the gels after the addition of the \nmushroom powders suggests that there were some components in the mushrooms that \nincreased their ability to stick to surfaces, such as starches or dietary fibers.  \nTable 2.

Consistent with the complex\nshear modulus measurements, the Young\u2019s modulus of the hybrid gels was considerably\nlower than that of the pure WPI gels at the same protein content, which suggests that\nthe presence of the mushroom particles interfered with the ability of the unfolded whey\nproteins to associate with each other and form a gel network. However, the impact of\nthe mushrooms on gel strength depended on mushroom type. For example, at 10% WPI,\nthe Young\u2019s modulus of the gels decreased in the following order WPI >> WPI + OM\n> WPI + SM but at 15% WPI, the Young\u2019s modulus decreased in the following order\nWPI >> WPI + SM > WPI + OM. These trends are therefore the same as those observed\nfor the dynamic shear modulus experiments discussed in Section 2.5. Interestingly, the\nincorporation of the mushroom powders into the WPI gels increased both their breaking\nstress and breaking strain. Consequently, the hybrid gels were much more resistant to\nrupture during compression than that of pure WPI gels. This may be an important attribute\nfor some kinds of plant-based foods.\nA double compression test was then used to provide additional insights into the\nimpact of the mushroom powders on the textural attributes of the WPI gels. The force\nversus distance profiles of the WPI and the hybrid gels were measured as they were\nsubjected to two successive compression-decompression cycles. The TPA parameters\nwere then calculated from these profiles and reported in Table 2.

Tristimulus Color Analysis\nThe tristimulus color coordinates (L*, a*, and b*) of the samples were measured to\nassess the impact of the two different mushroom powders on the appearance of the heat-set\nWPI gels (Figure 6). The lightness of the pure WPI gels was relatively high and decreased\nwith increasing protein content, being 79.0, 76.9, and 73.0 for the samples containing 10%,\n15%, and 20% w/wprotein, respectively. Moreover, these samples became slightly more\ngreen and slightly less yellow with increasing protein, with the a* values being \u22121.6,\u22123.1,\nand\u22123.7, and the b* values being +5.8, +3.8, and +2.7 for WPI gels containing 10%, 15%,\nand 20% w/wprotein, respectively. These effects may be a result of changes in the selective\nabsorption and scattering of light waves by the samples with increasing protein content [ 50].\nThe whey protein powder had a slightly beige color, indicating that it contained some\npigments that could selectively absorb light. Under the solution conditions used, the WPI\ngels would have contained particulate protein aggregates [ 15], which would scatter light\nwaves by an amount depending on their size, shape, and packing. The protein content\nwould be expected to impact the nature of the particulate aggregates formed, and therefore\nthe color coordinates of the heat-set WPI gels. The surface smoothness of the WPI gels\nincreased with increasing protein content, as seen in the digital photographs of them\n(Figure 6b).\nThe addition of mushroom powders to the WPI gels had a major impact on their\ntristimulus color coordinates (Figure 6a). In general, the lightness of the hybrid gels was\nlower than that of the WPI gels, and their color was stronger. Specifically, the samples\nchanged from greenish ( \u2212a*) to reddish (+a*) after addition of the mushroom powders,\nthey became more yellowish (higher +b values). The decrease in lightness and change in\ncolor of the WPI gels after addition of the mushroom powders can mainly be attributed to\nthe fact that they contained natural pigments that could selectively absorb light. Indeed,\nthe mushroom powders had a brownish color. The impact of the mushroom powders on\nthe overall appearance of the gels was assessed by taking digital photographs of them\n(Figure 6b). These photographs clearly showed that the hybrid gels had a darker appearance\nthan the WPI gels. They also showed that the hybrid gels had a much rougher surface\ntexture, which suggests that the presence of the mushroom particles disrupted the 3D gel\nnetwork normally formed by the whey proteins.\nThe brownish color, softer texture, and rougher surface texture of the hybrid gels may\nbe useful for some food applications.

The WHC values of all the samples was very high (>99.5%), suggesting that\nthey retained fluids well. This effect was probably because the whey proteins formed a 3D\nbiopolymer network that was relatively strong and contained small pores [ 52].

Conclusions\nIn conclusion, this work has shown that adding shitake or oyster powder to whey\nprotein gels changed their rheological and optical characteristics. Compared to pure whey\nprotein gels, they produced gels that were significantly softer, more malleable, and browner.\nThe physicochemical origin of these effects is currently not fully understood. The pigments\nand particles in the powdered mushrooms change how light waves are selectively absorbed\nand scattered by the gels, thereby changing the color and lightness of the gels. A variety of\ncomponents in the powdered mushrooms may modulate the way the protein molecules\ninteract with each other and form three-dimensional networks. For instance, mineral\nions from the mushrooms may be involved in ion binding and electrostatic screening\neffects, which may alter the electrostatic interactions between the proteins. Additionally,\nthe mushrooms contain polysaccharides (dietary fibers and starches) that can thicken the\naqueous phase surrounding the proteins, thereby slowing down their movement and\ninteractions, which could inhibit the formation of a strong gel network. Additionally, some\nof the polysaccharides may bind to the whey proteins or cause phase separation, which\ncould also alter protein gelation. Lastly, the hydrated particles in the powdered mushrooms\nwould act as \u201csoft\u201d fillers if their elastic modulus was less than that of the whey protein gel\nmatrix surrounding them. As a result, they would have reduced the stiffness of the hybrid\ngels. Further research is clearly needed to elucidate the molecular and physicochemical\norigin of the influence of mushroom particles on the physicochemical characteristics of\nhybrid whey protein-mushroom gels.\nThe findings of this study show that hybrid WPI-mushroom gels with a variety of\nphysicochemical characteristics can be created by varying their composition. Because the\nhybrid gels contain dietary fibers, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive components from the\nmushrooms, their nutritional profiles should be better than those of pure whey protein gels.\nFurthermore, the potential to produce hybrid gels with various textures and appearances\nmay increase the number of applications for whey proteins as useful components in more\nenvironmentally friendly and sustainable food products. For example, some of the hybrid\ngels that were generated were brownish in color, moderately soft, and bendable, which\nGels 2024 ,10, 446 13 of 18\ncould make them good for creating spreadable meat paste analogs. However, animal meat\nis known for its characteristic tenderness, juiciness, and flavor, influenced in part by the\ntype and quantity of fat present. In future studies, it would therefore be useful to examine\nthe impact of incorporating lipids into the WPI-mushroom gels on their appearance, texture,\nstability, and nutritional profile.\n4. Materials and Methods\n4.1. Materials\nDried oyster and shiitake mushrooms were purchased from New Tiger International\nCompany (Westbury, NY, USA). Sodium chloride (NaCl) was purchased from the Sigma-\nAldrich Co., Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Whey protein isolate (BiPro) was obtained from\nDavisco Foods International, Inc. (Eden Prairie, MN, USA).\n4.2. Sample Preparation\n4.2.1. Mushroom Powder Preparation\nThe dried mushroom powders were initially sheared using a high-speed blender for\n90 s at 6000 rpm to reduce their particle size and improve their homogeneity. The finely\nground mushroom powders were then sieved using a 20 mm mesh screen to remove any\nlarger particles.\n4.2.2. Protein and Protein-Mushroom Dispersion and Gel Preparation\nWhey protein isolate and mushroom powders were mixed in different ratios and then\ndispersed in double distilled water and stirred overnight at 350 rpm using a magnetic stirrer\nto hydrate and disperse them. Samples were prepared consisting of 10%, 15%, and 20%\nWPI only, as well as 10% WPI and 10% mushroom (10:10), and 15% WPI and 5% mushroom\n(15:5). These compositions were selected because they could form heat-set gels. In some\nexperiments, these protein and protein-mushroom dispersions were used directly, such as\nzeta-potential, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic shear rheology analyses. In\nother experiments, they were converted into heat-set gels before analysis by placing them in\nglass beakers and covering with silver foil followed by heating them in a water bath at 90\u25e6C\nfor 30 min, such as the texture profile, water holding capacity, and microscopy analyses.\n4.3. Mushroom Powder Composition\nThe proximate analysis of the mushroom samples was conducted according to the\nmethods described in detail by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists [ 55]. The\nmoisture content of the samples was determined using a hot air oven by drying the samples\nat 100 \u00b15\u25e6C to a constant weight. The crude fat content was estimated using a cold\nextraction method with hexane followed by drying in a hot air oven. The protein content\nwas estimated using the Dumas method using a nitrogen conversion factor for mushrooms\nof 4.38 [ 56]. This value is lower than the usual conversion factor for proteins because\nmushrooms have a substantial amount of non-protein nitrogenous substances (such as\nchitin). The total ash content was determined by incineration at 550 \u00b15\u25e6C using a muffle\nfurnace. Samples that had been previously dried in a hot air oven were used to conduct the\nash content analysis. The total carbohydrate content was expressed as the result obtained\nafter subtracting the sum of the moisture, ash, fat, and protein contents from 100.\n4.4. Thermogravimetric Analysis\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on powdered WPI, OM, and SM\nsamples. About 30\u201340 mg of the powdered samples were loaded into aluminum sample\npans (to about 2/3rd full) and then placed within the TGA instrument (Simultaneous Ther-\nmal Analyzer SDT 650, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). Each sample was initially\nequilibrated at 25\u25e6C and then heated from 25 to 800\u25e6C at 10\u25e6C/min. The change in the\nmass of the samples with temperature was then recorded during heating [ 57]. Temperature\nGels 2024 ,10, 446 14 of 18\nranges where major thermal transitions occurred were established by plotting the derivative\nthermogravimetry (DTG) profile of the mass v ersus temperature (d m/dT) results.\n4.5. Zeta-Potential Analysis\nThe electrical characteristics of whey protein molecules, mushroom particles, and their\ncombinations were measured using microelectrophoresis (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern\nInstruments, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). Initially, 0.1% ( w/v) SM, OM, and/or WPI\ndispersions were prepared with pH values ranging from 3 to 8. At least four measurements\nwere made at each data point to ensure accuracy. The zeta-potential of these dispersions\nwas then measured. HCl and NaOH stock solutions were used to make the pH adjustments\nof the samples.\n4.6. Differential Scanning Calorimetry\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to assess any thermal transitions of\nthe globular proteins in the samples during heating. Samples (50\u201370 mg) of protein, mush-\nroom, or protein-mushroom dispersions were placed into high volume aluminum pans,\nweighed accurately, and then sealed hermetically to prevent loss during the measurement.\nThe sample cells were then placed inside the DSC instrument (DSC25, TA Instruments, New\nCastle, DE, USA), equilibrated to 25\u25e6C, and then heated from 25 to 110\u25e6C at 3\u25e6C/min, as\ndescribed previously [ 57]. Measurements were recorded as the samples were heated and\nthe heat flow (W/g) was plotted against the temperature (\u25e6C).\n4.7. Dynamic Shear Rheology Analysis\nInitially, SM, OM, and/or WPI dispersions (pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl) were prepared by\ndispersing the powdered ingredients in double distilled water and then stirring overnight\nat 350 rpm at room temperature. The rheological properties of these different samples were\nthen analyzed under a dynamic shear rheometer (HR20, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE,\nUSA). Around 1.0 to 1.5 mL of the unheated test sample was placed in a parallel plate\n(40.00 mm, stainless steel, crosshatched, Peltier plate) sample cell. The edges of the sample\nwere then covered with mineral oil and a solvent trap was placed on top of the sample to\nreduce any evaporation during heating [ 57]. All analyses were performed using a gap of\n1000 \u00b5m between the parallel plates. The elastic (G\u2032) and viscous (G\u2032\u2032) shear moduli of the\nsamples were then measured as the samples were heated from 25 to 90\u25e6C at 6\u25e6C/min,\nincubated for 10 min at 90\u25e6C, and then cooled from 90 to 4\u25e6C at 6\u25e6C/min (strain 0.1%,\nfrequency 1 Hz).\n4.8. Texture Profile Analysis\nInitially, SM, OM, and/or WPI dispersions (pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl) were prepared by\ndispersing the powdered ingredients in double distilled water and then stirring overnight\nat 350 rpm at room temperature. The resulting dispersions were then poured into a glass\nflask, which was heated by placing it in a water bath at 90\u25e6C for 30 min, followed by\ncooling in an ice tray for 2 h. The resulting gelled samples were then removed and cut into\n1\u00d71\u00d71 cm3cubes. The textural attributes of the gelled samples were then analyzed using\nsingle and double compression tests performed using an instrumental texture analyzer\n(TA-XT2, Stable Micro System, Surrey, UK):\n\u2022 Double compression test: The texture profile analysis (TPA) parameters of the sam-\nples were determined using a double compression test, which involved a two-cycle\ncompression/decompression program. For these measurements, the pre-test speed,\ntest speed, and post-test speed were set at 2 mm/s, and the final target strain was\nset at 50%. A 5 s gap separated the two cycles. A cylindrical probe (P/50, 50 mm\nstainless cylinder) was used to carry out the tests [58]. The hardness, resilience, cohe-\nsion, springiness, gumminess, and chewiness of the samples were calculated from the\nresulting force-distance profiles.\nGels 2024 ,10, 446 15 of 18\n\u2022 Single compression test: The Young\u2019s modulus and fracture properties of the samples\nwere assessed using a single compression test. The same probe type was used as for\nthe double compression test. The pre-test speed, test speed, and post-test speed were\nset to 2, 1, and 10, mm/s, respectively, and the final target strain was set to 90% [ 57].\nThe Young\u2019s modulus, fracture stress, and fracture strain were calculated from the\nresulting stress-strain profiles.\n4.9. Tristimulus Color Analysis\nThe tristimulus color coordinates (L*, a*, and b*) were measured for each sample\nusing a colorimeter (ColorFlex EZ 45/0 LAV , Hunter Colorimeter, Hunter, VA, USA). The\ninstrument was first calibrated using standardized white and black plates by measuring\nthe reflectance using a standard light source (D65) and detection angle (10\u25e6C) [39]. During\nanalysis, the samples were placed in thin, transparent containers that were then placed into\nthe measurement cell of the instrument. The samples were covered with a black cup to\navoid light contamination during measurements [ 57]. Digital photographs of the gels were\nalso taken for reference.\n4.10. Water Holding Capacity Analysis\nThe water-holding capacity of the thermally induced gels was evaluated in triplicate\nwith slight modifications [ 59]. Approximately 1 g of various samples, including WPI,\nOM, SM, WPI + OM, and WPI + SM, were dissolved in double-distilled water containing\n100 mM NaCl. The mixtures were then stirred at 350 rpm for 3 h using a magnetic stirrer\nto hydrate and disperse them. The resulting dispersions were then transferred to 1.5 mL\nmicrocentrifuge tubes using a positive-displacement pipette. Following weighing, the\ntubes were heated at 90\u25e6C for 30 min in a water bath to form heat-set gels. After heating,\nthe samples were cooled to ambient temperature. The inner walls of the tubes were then\ndapped with a tissue to remove residual moisture and the samples were then weighed.\nThe samples were centrifuged at 300 \u00d7grpm for 2 min, transferred onto a white sheet for\nvisual inspection, and then allowed to drain by inverting the tubes for 10 min to assess\ntheir water content.\n4.11. Microstructure Analysis\nThe microstructure of the heat-set protein and/or mushroom gels were observed using\na confocal laser scanning microscope with a 10 \u00d7eye lens and a 40 \u00d7objective lens (Nikon\nD-Eclipse C1 80i, Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Prior to observation, gel samples were cut into\nthin layers (0.2 mm) using a sharp knife and then placed on the glass slide. The samples\nwere then stained with dyes that were specific for proteins, lipids, or polysaccharides: FITC\n(1 mg/mL in ethanol) for proteins; Nile red (1 mg/mL in water) for lipids; and calcofluor\nwhite (1 mg/mL in ethanol) for polysaccharides [ 60]. One or two drops of these dye were\nmixed with the samples and then the mixtures were incubated for 1\u20132 min. Excess dye was\nremoved using a Kim wipe without disrupting the sample. The samples were then covered\nwith a glass cover slip and observed under a microscope. The images were then collected,\nstored, and analyzed using the instrument software (NIS-Elements 4.2, Nikon, Melville,\nNY, USA).\n4.12. Statistical Analysis\nEach experiment was conducted using freshly prepared independent samples in\ntriplicates, except the dynamic shear rheology measurements, which was conducted in\nduplicates. The results were expressed as means and standard deviations, which were\ncalculated using Microsoft Excel (version 2405 (Build 17628.20144). Significant differences\nbetween samples ( p< 0.05) were determined by performing ANOVA (post hoc Tukey HSD\ntest) using R-program software (R version 4.3.1).\nGels 2024 ,10, 446 16 of 18\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.J.M.; methodology, R.S. and D.J.; validation, R.S., and\nD.J.; formal analysis, R.S.; investigation, R.S. and D.J.; resources, D.J.M.; data curation, R.S. and\nD.J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, R.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.J.M., R.S. and D.J.;\nvisualization, R.S. and D.J.M.; supervision, D.J.M.; project administration, D.J.M.; funding acquisition,\nD.J.M.
