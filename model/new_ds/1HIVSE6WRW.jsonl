It is derived from a whey protein concentrate and used in an infant and\nfollow-on formula manufactured by FrieslandCampina Nederland B.V., which submitted a dossier to theEuropean Commission to request an amendment of Regulation (EU) 2016/127 with respect to theprotein sources that may be used in the manufacture of infant and/or follow-on formula. The proteinhydrolysate under evaluation is suf \ufb01ciently characterised with respect to the fraction of the hydrolysed\nprotein. In the pertinent intervention study provided, an infant formula manufactured from the proteinhydrolysate with a protein content of 2.4 g/100 kcal and consumed as the sole source of nutrition by\ninfants for 3 months led to a growth equivalent to a formula manufactured from intact cow \u2019s milk\nprotein with a protein content of 2.1 g/100 kcal. Data on gastrointestinal tolerance of the formula didnot raise any concerns. No experimental data have been provided on the nutritional safety andsuitability of this protein source in follow-on formula. Given that it is consumed with complementaryfoods and the protein source is nutritionally safe and suitable in an infant formula that is the solesource of nutrition of infants, the Panel considers that the protein hydrolysate is also a nutritionallysafe and suitable protein source for use in follow-on formula. The Panel concludes that the proteinhydrolysate under evaluation is a nutritionally safe and suitable protein source for use in infant and\nfollow-on formula, as long as the formula in which it is used contains a minimum of 2.4 g/100 kcal\nprotein and complies with the compositional criteria of Regulation (EU) 2016/127 and the amino acidpattern in its Annex IIIA.\n\u00a92023 European Food Safety Authority.

Introduction\n1.1. Background and Terms of Reference as provided by the requestor\n1.1.1. Background\nCommission Directive 2006/141/EC1lays down harmonised rules applicable in the entire EU to\ninfant formulae and follow-on formulae. The Directive allows the use of protein hydrolysates as sourceof protein in infant formulae and follow-on formulae under certain conditions (Articles 5 \u20137; Annex I,\npoint 2.2; Annex II, point 2.2 and Annex VI).\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127\n2transfers the existing rules of Directive\n2006/141/EC under the new framework of Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the EuropeanParliament and of the Council\n3and revises them, based on the opi nion of the European Food Safety\nAuthority (EFSA) of 2014.4In that opinion, EFSA noted that \u2018the safety and suitability of each\nspeci \ufb01c formula containing protein hydrolysates has to be established by clinical studies.\nInformation on protein sources and the technological processes applied should also be provided. Inthis context, the Panel notes that one particular formula containing partially hydrolysed whey\nprotein has been evaluated for its safety and suitability by the Panel ( ...) and has been authorised\nfor use by Directive 2006/141/EC \u2019. EFSA also noted that \u2018the criteria given in Directive 2006/141/EC\nalone are not suf \ufb01cient to predict the potential of a formula to reduce the risk of developing allergy\nto milk proteins. Clinical studies are necessary to demonstrate if and to what extent a particularformula reduces the risk of developing short- and lo ng-term clinical manifestations of allergy in at-\nrisk infants who are not exclusively breast fed \u2019.\nTaking into account EFSA \u2019s opinion, the Delegated Regulation establishes that infant formula and\nfollow-on formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates should only be allowed to be placed on the\nmarket if their composition corresponds to the one positively assessed by EFSA so far and prohibits the\nuse of health claims describing the role of infant formula in reducing the risk of developing allergy tomilk proteins. The requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 shall apply toinfant formula and follow-on formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates from 22 February 2021.\nPursuant to Recital 21 of the Regulation, these requirements may be amended in the future in\norder to allow the placing on the market of formulae manufactured from protein hydrolysates with acomposition different from the one already positively assessed, following a case-by-case evaluation oftheir safety and suitability by EFSA. In addition, if, after the assessment by EFSA, it is demonstrated\nthat a speci \ufb01c formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates reduces the risk of developing allergy\nto milk proteins, further consideration will be given to how to adequately inform parents andcaregivers about that property of the product.\nThe requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 shall apply to infant formula\nand follow-on formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates from 22 February 2021. It can beexpected that, before that date, dossiers on formulae manufactured from protein hydrolysates will bepresented by food business operators for assessment by EFSA with a view to request possiblemodi \ufb01cations of the conditions applicable to these products in the delegated Regulation.\nIn this context, it is considered necessary to ask EFSA to provide scienti \ufb01c advice to the\nCommission on dossiers on formulae manufactured from protein hydrolysates submitted by foodbusiness operators for assessment by EFSA in the future.\nEFSA will be informed by the Commission by letter when the applicant has been asked by the\nCommission to transmit the dossier to EFSA for scienti \ufb01c assessment.\n1Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae and amending Directive\n1999/21/EC, OJ L 401, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\n2Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 of 25 September 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council as regards the speci \ufb01c compositional and information requirements for infant formula\nand follow-on formula and as regards requirements on information relating to infant and young child feeding, OJ L 25,\n2.2.2016, p. 1.\n3Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on food intended for infants and\nyoung children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control and repealing Council\nDirective 92/52/EEC, Commission Directives 96/8/EC, 1999/21/EC, 2006/125/EC and 2006/141/EC, Directive 2009/39/EC of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulations (EC) No 41/2009 and (EC) No 953/2009, OJ L 181,29.6.2013, p. 35.\n4EFSA NDA Panel (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies), 2014.

Terms of Reference\nIn accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/20025, the European Commission requests\nthe European Food Safety Authority to issue scienti \ufb01c opinions on infant and follow-on formula\nmanufactured from protein hydrolysates, in particular, depending on the nature of the application, on:\n1) the safety and suitability for use by infants of a speci \ufb01c formula manufactured from protein\nhydrolysates;\nIf the formula under evaluation is considered to be safe and suitable for use by infants, the\nEuropean Food Safety Authority is also asked to advise on the minimum speci \ufb01c criteria on\nprotein source, protein processing and protein quality of the formula that need to be satis \ufb01ed\nfor the safety and suitability of such formulae to be demonstrated.\n2) the product \u2019se f\ufb01cacy in reducing the risk of developing allergy to milk proteins;\n3) the product \u2019se f\ufb01cacy in reducing the risk of developing allergy/allergic manifestations to\nallergens in general.\n1.2. Interpretation of the Terms of Reference\nThe interpretation by the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) is that the\nsafety of food enzymes or their combination that are used in the manufacture of the protein hydrolysate\nis not to be assessed in this opinion. The assessment of the safety of food enzymes is performed by theEFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids (CEP) according to the guidanceand statements of the CEF/CEP Panel (EFSA CEF Panel, 2009, 2016; EFSA CEP Panel, 2019). Thisassessment is ongoing at the time of the adoption of the present opinion.\nTherefore, the conclusions of the Panel are related to the nutritional safety and suitability of the\nspeci \ufb01c protein hydrolysate used to manufacture the infant and follow-on formula for which the\nsubmission has been made. The conclusions are not related to the safety of the protein hydrolysate in\ngeneral, including the safety of the individual enzymes or their combination. Neither are they related to\nthe safety of the \ufb01nal formula. This is justi \ufb01ed as the composition of the formula with respect to\nsubstances other than the protein fraction should comply with the compositional requirements laiddown in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 in order to ensure the nutritional safety andsuitability for use by infants. The conclusions of the Panel also do not refer to the ef \ufb01cacy of the\nformula in reducing the risk of developing allergic manifestations.\n2. Data and methodologies\n2.1. Data\nThe assessment of the nutritional safety and suitability of the speci \ufb01c protein hydrolysate derived\nfrom a whey protein concentrate and used in infant formula6and follow-on formula7is based on the\ndata supplied in the dossier submitted to EFSA (EFSA-Q-2020-00025) and the additional informationprovided by the food business operator upon request.\nA common and structured format for the presentation of dossiers related to infant and follow-on\nformula manufactured from protein hydrolysates is described in the EFSA scienti \ufb01c and technical guidance\nfor the preparation and presentation of an application for authorisation of an infant and/or follow-onformula manufactured from protein hydrolysates.\n8As outlined in this guidance, it is the duty of the food\nbusiness operator who submitted the dossier to provide all available scienti \ufb01c data which are pertinent to\nthe dossier. The procedure followed by EFSA for handling dossiers on formulae manufactured fromprotein hydrolysates, the various steps in the procedure and estimated timelines is described online.\n9\n5Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general\nprinciples and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures inmatters of food safety, OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1.\n6Infant formula means food intended for use by infants during the \ufb01rst months of life and satisfying by itself the nutritional\nrequirements of such infants until the introduction of appropriate complementary feeding.\n7Follow-on formula means food intended for use by infants when appropriate complementary feeding is introduced and which\nconstitutes the principal liquid element in a progressively diversi \ufb01ed diet of such infants.\n8EFSA NDA Panel (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies), 2017.

Methodologies\nThe assessment follows the methodology set out in the EFSA guidance for the preparation and\npresentation of an application for authorisation of an infant and/or follow-on formula manufactured\nfrom protein hydrolysates. Previous EFSA work10and the regulatory framework were also taken into\naccount.\nAs the formula in which the protein hydrolysate under evaluation is used, is marketed only in\npowder form, stability data were not evaluated for the formula (even though requested in the scienti \ufb01c\nand technical guidance8) as it is not expected that protein hydrolysis continues in powdered formulae.\n3. Assessment\n3.1. Characterisation of the protein hydrolysate\nProtein source\nThe protein hydrolysate under evaluation is produced from whey protein concentrate (WPC)\n. Certi \ufb01cates of analysis of \ufb01ve batches of the WPC were\nprovided by the food business operator. Protein contents of the WPC ranged between\n11. Individual intact proteins in the source material have been identi \ufb01ed by their molecular\nweight by sodium dodecyl sulfate \u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS \u2013PAGE) and the information\nhas been provided in the submitted dossier.\nProtein processing\nThe protein hydrolysate is produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and ISO 9001:2015\n(Quality Management System) and ISO 22000:2005 (Food Safety Management System), as indicated\nin two certi \ufb01cates provided in the submitted dossier.\nIn order to produce the hydrolysate, the source material (i.e. WPC) is hydrated and heated to\n. The temperature and pH are kept at and for the hydrolysis, respectively.\nThe protein hydrolysate is produced in a\nThe food enzymes and their sources have been identi \ufb01ed.

Analytical measures\nwere obtained for \ufb01ve independent batches, for which certi \ufb01cates of analysis were provided for free\nAN and TN after hydrolysis. Free AN and TN before hydrolysis has been calculated based on publishedamino acid sequence data. The values for free AN/TN before hydrolysis were subtracted from free AN/TN after hydrolysis to derive h. The total number of peptide bonds in the source material (i.e. WPC),h\ntot, was derived from a published database and divided by calculated TN before hydrolysis.\nThe molecular weight distribution of peptides, based on the same \ufb01ve independent batches as\nabove, for which certi \ufb01cates of analysis were provided, are on average % (SD):\n1\u2013500 Da:\n500\u20131,000 Da:\n1,000 \u20132,000 Da:\n2,000 \u20135,000 Da:\n5,000 \u201310,000 Da:\n>10,000 Da:\nThe molecular weight distribution of peptides was measured by ultra performance liquid\nchromatography-size exclusion chromatography with ultraviolet (UV) detection at 214 nm (UPLC-SEC,acidic method pH = 2; internal method based on Smyth and FitzGerald (1997)). This method wasindicated to have been validated and brie \ufb02y described by the food business operator. Name of the\ncolumn used (ACQUITY UPLC Protein BEH SEC column) and system calibration, including details on thecalibrators, was provided by the food business operator upon request.\nData on the amount of residual proteins (de \ufb01ned as the fraction >10,000 Da) and on the amount\nof peptides (de \ufb01ned as the fraction <10,000 Da) in the protein hydrolysate were provided. These data\nwere derived from analysis of the molecular weight distribution of peptides as described above andbased on the total protein content calculated from TN, analysed as described above. Data on thecontent of free amino acids in the protein hydrolysate were also provided. Free amino acids weremeasured according to Schuster (1988) by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography(RP-HPLC), and tryptophan by an Association of Of \ufb01cial Analytical Collaboration (AOAC) of \ufb01cial method\nof analysis, in a laboratory that was presented as being accredited for amino acid analyses. Valueswere obtained for \ufb01ve independent batches (including four of the previously mentioned batches) and\ncerti\ufb01cates of analysis have been provided.\nRegarding Maillard reaction products, the concentrations of blocked and total lysine (i.e. reactive and\nblocked), furosine and carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) in \ufb01ve independent batches of the protein\nhydrolysate have been provided (including one not previously investigated batch and four othersinvestigated for some of the parameters mentioned above). Certi \ufb01cates of analysis have been provided.\nAnalytical methods applied for furosine and total lysine were based on\n, respectively, and were brie \ufb02y described. The method used to analyse CML was also brie \ufb02y\ndescribed by the food business operator. Validation reports for the methods used to analyse furosine and\nCML have been provided. Blocked lysine was calculated from values of furosine and total lysine.\nContrary to the con \ufb01dential speci \ufb01cations provided, the Panel notes that the non-con \ufb01dential\nspeci \ufb01cations provided by the food business operator upon request by EFSA with respect to the\ntemperature and pH applied during hydrolysis, the temperature used to inactivate the food enzymes,the DH and the molecular weight distribution of peptides were broad and could not be used in thecharacterisation of the protein hydrolysate. Therefore, they are not reported in the Opinion.\nThe Panel considers that the protein hydrolysate that has been used in the manufacture of the\ninfant formula for which the dossier has been submitted is suf \ufb01ciently characterised with respect to the\nfraction of the hydrolysed protein.\n3.2. Characterisation of the formula manufactured from the protein\nhydrolysate used in the clinical study provided\nThe infant formula, manufactured from the protein hydrolysate assessed in Section 3.1, and that is\nused in the unpublished clinical study provided, complies with the compositional criteria laid down inCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127\n2.Nutritional safety and suitability of a protein hydrolysate\nwww.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 7 EFSA Journal 2023;21(7):8063\nThe infant formula is produced under ISO 22000:2005, ISO/TS 22002 \u20131:2009 and additional Food\nSafety System Certi \ufb01cation (FSSC) 22000 requirements, according to a FSSC certi \ufb01cate provided in the\ndossier.\nThis infant formula has a protein content of 0.57 g/100 kJ (2.4 g/100 kcal) and an amino acid\npro\ufb01le complying with Annex IIIA of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1272. During the\nmanufacturing process of this powdered formula, free amino acids ( L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine) are\nadded to the formula and additional heat treatments are applied, including homogenisation,pasteurisation and spray drying.\nFurosine and CML have been analysed, according to the methods described in Section 3.1, in three\nbatches of the infant formula. The concentrations fell within the range of furosine and CMLconcentrations found in seven different commercially available infant formulae with intact protein, asanalysed by the food business operator. Certi \ufb01cates of analyses have been provided.\nThe Panel considers that the infant formula that is used in the pertinent human intervention study\nis suf \ufb01ciently characterised.\n3.3. Nutritional safety and suitability of the infant formula\n3.3.1. Human intervention studies\nThe food business operator performed a literature search in PubMed on 16 January 2016 (no time\nlimit speci \ufb01ed) for human intervention studies on measures of growth of infants who exclusively\nconsumed formula manufactured from whey protein hydrolysates. Through this search, the food\nbusiness operator identi \ufb01ed six potentially pertinent studies, reported in seven papers (Giovannini\net al., 1994; Exl et al., 2000; Schmelzle et al., 2003; Florendo et al., 2009; Rzehak et al., 2009; Rzehaket al., 2011; Borschel et al., 2014). These studies were conducted with formulae other than the infantformula for which the dossier has been submitted. The Panel considers that no conclusions can bedrawn from them for the scienti \ufb01c assessment of the nutritional safety and suitability of the protein\nhydrolysate for which the dossier has been submitted.\nThe food business operator also presented an unpublished full study report (Manios and\nKantaras, 2023, unpublished) of one pertinent randomised controlled trial (RCT) on 345 healthy term\ninfants. The infants were exclusively fed for 3 months with either the infant formula for which the\ndossier has been submitted (formula manufactured from hydrolysed whey protein, HF) or an infantformula manufactured from intact cow \u2019s milk protein (control formula, CF). The HF had a protein\ncontent of 0.57 g/100 kJ (2.4 g/100 kcal) and the CF of 0.50 g/100 kJ (2.1 g/100 kcal). The CF was acommercially available infant formula and the composition complied with Commission DelegatedRegulation (EU) 2016/127.\nThe equivalence study was conducted in Greece (Attica, Thessaly and Thessaloniki). Healthy term\ninfants up to 28 days of age with a birthweight between 2,500 and 4,200 g were included in the\nstudy. The infants had to be exclusively formula-fed for at least 5 days prior to inclusion in the study.\nExclusively formula-fed infants with caregivers willing to participate in the study were identi \ufb01ed by\nprivate paediatricians. Their eligibility was veri \ufb01ed by a junior paediatrician during a home visit during\nwhich also the baseline anthropometric measurements were taken. Eligible infants were thenrandomised in blocks of eight, strati \ufb01ed by gender and using central randomisation, to consume one of\nfour coded formulae. Two of the codes pertained to the HF and two the CF . In case of inclusion oftwins, the \ufb01rst twin was randomised and the second allocated to the same group. Formulae were\nprovided in blank tins with one of the four codes printed on them. The blinding for study personnel\nwas maintained throughout the study. The unblinding for data analysis occurred after the lock of the\ndatabase.\nThe primary outcome was average weight gain per day between baseline and 17 weeks of age.\nThe primary analysis was identi \ufb01ed as the one done on the per protocol (PP) population. Secondary\noutcomes were length gain, head circumference (HC) gain, absolute weight, length and HC, bodymass index (BMI) and variable (weight, length, HC and BMI)-for-age and weight-for-length z-scores(based on World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standards using WHO Anthro for personalcomputers, version 3.2.2, 2011). Other outcomes were formula intake, gastrointestinal tolerance, stool\nfrequency, stool consistency, amount and colour. Adverse events and serious adverse events were also\nrecorded.\nAnthropometric measurements were taken by junior paediatricians at home visits according to\nstandard operating procedures. Home visits took place at baseline, 8 weeks of age ( /C61 day),Nutritional safety and suitability of a protein hydrolysate\nwww.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 8 EFSA Journal 2023;21(7):8063\n13 weeks of age ( /C61 day) and 17 weeks of age ( /C61 day). Infants were weighed without clothes\nwith a clean nappy while lying on a scale that was calibrated each month and checked with areference weight before each measurement. Measurements were taken around the same time of theday at each visit. Length was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using an infantometer and HC wasmeasured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a non-elastic tape. All measurements were performed induplicate. If the difference was more than 20 g, 0.7 cm or 0.5 cm, respectively, a third measurementwas taken. The mean of two or the median of three was used in the analysis.\nGastrointestinal tolerance was assessed using the Infant Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire\n(IGSQ) (Riley et al., 2015) and a crying diary, and stool characteristics using the Amsterdam Infant\nStool Scale (Bekkali et al., 2009). Formula intake was recorded in diaries for 7 days before each studyvisit and from day 3 to 7 and day 10 to 14 after the baseline visit. Parents were also asked to recordany vomiting or regurgitation and had to hand in the empty formula tins.\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SAS PROC MIXED.In the primary analysis, study formula and gender were included as \ufb01xed interaction terms with\ntime (formula 9time, formula 9time9time, gender 9time, and gender 9time9time), and\ngender, birth weight and maternal gestational diabetes were used as covariates. A Huynh-Feldt\ncovariance matrix was used.\nUnadjusted analyses for the primary outcome using the two one-sided-t-test (TOST) procedure, as\nwell as summary statistics for other anthropometric outcomes were also presented.\nSample size was calculated assuming a mean difference in weight gain of 0.9 g/day, an SD of 6 g/day\nand using an equivalence margin of /C63 g/day. When using a signi \ufb01cance level of 5% and a power of\n80%, it was calculated that 103 infants would need to be enrolled per formula group. Assuming a 25%drop-out rate, 138 infants needed to be enrolled per group (in total 276 infants).\nAfter enrolment of 121 infants a pre-planned interim analysis was conducted by an independent\nstatistician comparing the intervention and control groups in the PP population. This led to an increase\nin sample size to a total of 345 infants.\nBaseline characteristics of parents were similar in both groups except for maternal gestational\ndiabetes and paternal smoking that were both higher in the group consuming the HF . Baselinecharacteristics of infants were similar in the full analysis set (FAS), i.e. all randomised participants whowere fed at least once with the study product. It consisted of 173 and 172 infants in the HF and CFgroups at baseline, respectively, and 138 and 150 infants at 17 weeks of age. No imputations ofmissing data were made. In the PP population (122 in the HF and 142 in the CF group), statistically\nsigni \ufb01cant differences at baseline were observed for HC-for-age z-scores and BMI-for-age z-scores,\nwhich were in the magnitude of around 0.1 z-scores with higher values observed in the HF group. ThePanel considers that this magnitude is not of biological relevance.\nIn the PP population (primary analysis), weight gain per day was similar in both groups and\namounted to a mean (SD) of around 30.9 (6.2) g/day. The adjusted analyses of the data showed anadjusted mean difference of /C00.08 g/day (90% con \ufb01dence interval (CI) \u20131.25 \u20131.10). The unadjusted\nanalysis showed similar results, with the mean difference being 0.09 g/day (90% CI \u20131.36 \u20131.18). The\nresults of the analyses in the FAS population were similar. The Panel notes that the 90% CIs of both\nthe PP and the FAS population fell within the prespeci \ufb01ed equivalence margin and allowed to\ndemonstrate the equivalence of the intervention to the control formula with respect to weight gain.\nThere were also no statistically signi \ufb01cant differences in length and HC gain between groups, i.e.\n0.002 cm (90% CI \u20130.001 \u20130.006) cm and /C00.002 cm (90% CI /C00.004 to 0), respectively (adjusted\nanalyses, PP population).\nResults from the adjusted analysis on absolute weight, length, HC and BMI, and respective variables\nas z-scores also showed no biologically relevant differences in growth parameters between groups.\nAverage formula intake in the group of all infants who consumed the allocated formula was similar\nin both groups and amounted to on average (SD) 687 (153) mL/day and 710 (161) mL/day in the HF\nand CF groups, respectively, at day 8 from baseline and to 901 (179) mL/day and 906 (180) mL/day,respectively, at the end of the study.\nResults for gastrointestinal tolerance and stool characteristics were not presented, as results of the\nanalyses were not yet available at the time of submission of the anthropometric data to EFSA.Individual data on adverse events that occurred during the study were provided. Gastrointestinalcomplaints occurred in 15 out of 173 infants in the HF and 13 out of 172 infants in the CF group, threeof which were classi \ufb01ed as serious adverse events (one in the HF and two in the CF group). They were\nconsidered by the investigators as de \ufb01nitely related to the study formula in six infants in the HF group\n(vomiting: one infant; posseting: one infant; strong odour on the clothes, skin, urine and faeces of theNutritional safety and suitability of a protein hydrolysate\nwww.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 9 EFSA Journal 2023;21(7):8063\ninfant and gas production: one infant; diarrhoea >1 day: one infant; diarrhoea >1 day and vomiting:\none infant colics and constipation: one infant) and one in the CF group (diarrhoea >1 day). None of\nthem was classi \ufb01ed as serious adverse event. Gastrointestinal complaints possibly related to the study\nformula (as classi \ufb01ed by the investigators) occurred in \ufb01ve infants in the HF group (posseting/vomiting\nafter feeding: three infants (in one infant also decreased appetite); vomiting and gas production: oneinfant; colics and bloated abdomen: one infant and classi \ufb01ed as serious adverse event) and in two\ninfants in the CF group (esophagitis, milk protein allergy: one infant; posseting: one infant, noneconsidered as serious adverse event).\nAdverse events (not restricted to gastrointestinal complaints) were the reason for withdrawal of 12\ninfants in the HF group and 9 infants in the CF group. Four infants in each group stopped theintervention because the infants disliked the milk. The Panel notes that the number of infants withgastrointestinal complaints was similar between groups. Although the number of infants withgastrointestinal complaints that were considered by the investigators to be possibly or de \ufb01nitely related\nto the study formula was higher in the HF group there was no consistent pattern in those symptomsthat would allow to relate those symptoms with suf \ufb01cient certainty to the intervention formula. The\nPanel considers that the data submitted with respect to gastrointestinal complaints recorded as\nadverse events do not give rise to concern. This judgement is based on the observation that overall\ngastrointestinal complaints were similar in both groups and occurred in a limited number of infants(<10%), that no consistent pattern in the occurrence of individual symptoms could be identi \ufb01ed and\nthat the described complaints are commonly occurring in infants of that age, which introduces someuncertainty regarding whether the complaints were related to the study products.\nThe Panel considers that this study shows that an infant formula manufactured from the protein\nhydrolysate described in Section 3.1with a protein content of 0.57 g/100 kJ (2.4 g/100 kcal) and\nconsumed as the sole source of nutrition for 3 months leads to growth that is equivalent to an\ninfant formula manufactured from intact cow \u2019s milk protein with a protein content of 0.50 g/100 kJ\n(2.1 g/100 kcal). The Panel concludes that the protein hydrolysate under evaluation is a nutritionallysafe and suitable protein source for use in infant formula, as long as the infant formula in which itis used contains a minimum of 0.57 g/100 kJ (2.4 g/100 kcal) protein and complies with thecompositional criteria of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 and the amino acidpattern in Annex IIIA of the Regulation.\nNo experimental data have been provided on the nutritional safety and suitability of this protein\nsource in follow-on formula. However, given the fact that follow-on formula is consumed in conjunction\nwith complementary foods and the protein source is considered nutritionally safe and suitable in an\ninfant formula that is the sole source of nutrition of infants, the Panel considers that the proteinhydrolysate under evaluation is also a nutritionally safe and suitable protein source for use in follow-onformula, as long as the follow-on formula in which it is used contains a minimum of 0.57 g/100 kJ(2.4 g/100 kcal) protein and complies with the compositional criteria of Commission DelegatedRegulation (EU) 2016/127 and the amino acid pattern in Annex IIIA of the Regulation.\n3.4. Uncertainties related to the nutritional safety and suitability of the\ninfant formula\nThe Panel notes that results on the gastrointestinal tolerance and stool characteristics were not\nprovided. The considerations of the Panel that there is no concern with respect to the tolerance of thestudy formula are based on adverse event reporting and expert judgement. The considerations madeby the Panel in this relation are given in Section 3.3.\n4. Conclusions\nThe Panel concludes that:\n\u0081the protein hydrolysate for which the dossier has been submitted and that is to be used in the\nmanufacture of infant and follow-on formula is suf \ufb01ciently characterised with respect to its\nfraction of hydrolysed protein;\n\u0081the minimum speci \ufb01c criteria for characterisation of the protein hydrolysate with respect to the\nprotein source, protein processing and protein quality, as requested in the terms of reference,are those given in Section 3.1;\n\u0081the protein hydrolysate for which the dossier has been submitted is a nutritionally safe and\nsuitable protein source for use in infant and follow-on formula, as long as the formula in whichNutritional safety and suitability of a protein hydrolysate\nwww.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 10 EFSA Journal 2023;21(7):8063\nit is used contains a minimum of 0.57 g/100 kJ (2.4 g/100 kcal) protein and complies with the\nother compositional criteria of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 and the aminoacid pattern in Annex IIIA of the Regulation.\n5.
