However, the comparative changes in meat quality attributes of sous-vide cooked chicken\nbreast and thigh muscles are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the\neffects of sous-vide cooking conditions, based on collagen denaturation temperature of intramuscular\nconnective tissue, on the physicochemical properties of chicken breasts and thighs. Chicken breast\nand thigh were cooked at four sous-vide cooking conditions (55\u000eC for 3/6 h and 65\u000eC for 3/6 h) and\nconventional cooking at 75\u000eC (core temperature of 71\u000eC) as control. No signi\ufb01cant differences in pH\nand lightness were found between the sous-vide cooking conditions. Moisture content, cooking loss,\nprotein solubility, shear force, myo\ufb01brillar fragmentation index, and lipid oxidation were affected\nby sous-vide cooking conditions ( p< 0.05). The decreased shear force and total collagen content\nof 65\u000eC sous-vide cooking treatment might be associated with collagen denaturation ( p< 0.05).\nSous-vide cooking at 55\u000eC could decrease cooking loss, with higher moisture than sous-vide cooking\nat 65\u000eC (p< 0.05 ). These tendencies on water-holding capacity and shear force at the two different\ntemperatures were similarly observed for both chicken breast and thigh. Therefore, this study\nindicates that chicken breast and thigh are similarly affected by the sous-vide cooking conditions\nand suggests that a novel strategy to apply together two temperature ranges based on the thermal\ndenaturation of intramuscular connective tissue would be required.\nKeywords: collagen content; myo\ufb01brillar fragmentation index; tenderness; water-holding capacity\n1. Introduction\nSous-vide cooking is generally known as a culinary technique to heat vacuum-packaged\nfood under a low controlled temperature for a long time [ 1]. In the meat service sector, this\ncooking method has been extensively used to serve tender and juicier meat. Moreover,\nsome previous studies have found additional positive impacts of sous-vide cooking, such as\na reduction in nutrient loss and prevention of the loss of \ufb02avor-related volatile compounds\nduring meat cooking [ 2,3]. For these reasons, sous-vide cooking is now considered a\npromising thermal process for improving the palatability of processed meat products,\nmainly tenderness, juiciness, and \ufb02avor. Moreover, despite the relatively low cooking\ntemperature, it has been reported that sous-vide cooking may have no adverse impacts on\nthe microbial safety of meat during storage [4].\nIn practice, sous-vide cooking improves the tenderness and juiciness of chicken breast\nand provides an unexpected crumbly and dry mouthfeel [ 1,3]. However, the sous-vide\nconditions for guaranteeing the desirable positive effects on chicken breasts have varied,\nparticularly regarding temperature and time. Park et al. [ 1] found that sous-vide cooking at\n60\u000eC for 120\u2013180 min (experimental setting under 60\u201370\u000eC for 60\u2013180 min) could improve\nthe palatability of chicken breast. However, Haghighi et al. [ 4] suggested that sous-vide\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12132592 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592 2 of 12\ncooking at 60\u000eC for 60 min could be an optimal condition to improve the eating quality\nattributes of the chicken breast. Furthermore, Hasani et al. [ 5] recently reported that a\ntemperature combination of 50 and 60\u000eC for sous-vide cooking could improve the cooking\nloss and gumminess of chicken breast. Thus, sous-vide cooking at 60\u000eC might be optimal\nfor guaranteeing desirable quality attributes of sous-vide cooked meat.\nDuring the cooking process of meat, muscle proteins related to water-holding capacity\nand tenderness are thermally denatured at different temperatures; myo\ufb01brillar and stromal\nproteins are 40\u201350\u000eC and 65\u201375\u000eC, respectively [ 5]. The biochemical changes cause water\nloss from muscle tissue and shrinkage of muscle structure, resulting in a decline in juiciness\nand tenderness. Moreover, thermal shrinkage of collagenous connective tissues changes\nthe structural integrity, which also affects the juiciness and tenderness of cooked meat.\nAccording to Purslow [ 6], the thermal denaturation of collagen in intramuscular connective\ntissues could occur at 55\u201360\u000eC at a slow heating rate, which might be related to the effects\nof low temperature and longtime cooking. The connective tissue of chicken muscle is\nmostly intramuscular; thus, it could be expected that temperature-inducing intramuscular\ncollagen denaturation is one signi\ufb01cant factor related to the ef\ufb01cacies of sous-vide cooking.\nHowever, there have been no experimental approaches to determine sous-vide conditions\nbased on the thermal denaturation of intramuscular collagen.\nThe impacts of thermal processing on meat quality attributes differ depending on\nintrinsic factors, mainly muscle \ufb01ber composition [ 7]. Chicken breasts and thighs have\ndifferent muscle \ufb01ber characteristics called \u2018white muscle\u2019 and \u2018red muscle\u2019, respectively.\nHowever, most previous studies regarding the ef\ufb01cacies of sous-vide cooking on chicken\nmeat quality have focused on improving the sensory acceptance of chicken breasts. Even\nthough chicken breast and thigh meat are often cooked together, there is no available\nliterature on the meat quality attributes of chicken breast and thigh cooked under the same\nsous-vide cooking conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate\nthe implications of sous-vide cooking conditions based on the denaturation temperature\nof intramuscular connective tissue on the meat quality attributes of chicken breast and\nthigh muscles.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Raw Materials\nForty-\ufb01ve raw chicken carcasses (commercial broilers, 1354 \u000644.86 g average live\nweight), which were fed commercial crumble-pellet feeds and reared in a multilayer\ncage system farm, were purchased from a local poultry processing company and were\nused for the experiment within 1 day after purchase. Fifteen chicken carcasses were\nrandomly grouped as a batch, from which thirty chicken breasts and thighs were manually\ncollected and randomly assigned to \ufb01ve cooking condition treatments (six breasts and\nthighs/treatment/batch).\n2.2. Sous-Vide Cooking Procedure\nThe skinless chicken breasts and thighs were individually vacuum-packaged in a\nnylon/polyethylene (PA/PE) pouch (150 cm \u0002200 cm, thickness 65 \u0016m). Five cooking\nconditions based on the thermal denaturation of intramuscular connective tissues were\nperformed in a constant-temperature and circulation water bath. The temperature and time\nsettings were as follows: conventional cooking at 75\u000eC until 71\u000eC core temperature (as\ncontrol); sous-vide cooking at 55\u000eC for 3 h (55\u000eC/3 h); 55\u000eC for 6 h (55\u000eC/6 h); 65\u000eC\nfor 3 h (65\u000eC/3 h); and 65\u000eC for 6 h (65\u000eC/6 h). The core temperature of the control\ngroup was monitored using an insert-type digital thermometer (Tes-1305, Tes Electrical\nCorp., Taipai, Taiwan) with an iron constantan thermocouple, and the control samples were\nremoved from the water bath when the core temperature reached 71\u000eC (average heating\nrate of 8\u000eC/min). All cooked samples were cooled at room temperature (20 \u00061\u000eC) for 3 h\nand used for further analysis.\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592 3 of 12\n2.3. Analysis of Sous-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh\n2.3.1. pH Measurement\nThe pH of the samples was measured in triplicates using an insert-type pH meter\n(HI99163, Hanna Instruments, Smith\ufb01eld, RI, USA. The pH meter was calibrated using\nthe manufacturer\u2019s standard buffer solutions (pH 4.01 and 7.00, Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c,\nWaltham, MA, USA).\n2.3.2. Moisture Content\nThe moisture content of cooked samples was measured in triplicate according to\nthe oven-drying method (950.45B) of the Association of Of\ufb01cial Analytical Chemists [ 8].\nMoisture content was expressed as g of moisture per 100 g of sample (g/100 g).\n2.3.3. Total Collagen Content\nThe total collagen content of the sample was determined in duplicate according to the\nmethod described by Starkey et al. [ 9] with slight modi\ufb01cation. A total of 100 milligrams\nof the sample were mixed with 3 mL of 3.5 M sulfuric acid and hydrolyzed at a 105\u000eC\ndrying oven for 16 h. The hydrolysate was diluted with 50 mL of distilled water and\nthen \ufb01ltered through a \ufb01lter paper (Whatman no. 1). Then, 1 milliliter of the \ufb01ltrate\nwas mixed with 3.75 mL of distilled water and 0.25 mL of 1.5 M NaOH, and 0.5 mL of\nthe mixture was \ufb01nally reacted with 0.25 mL of oxidant solution (50 mM chloramine-T\nhydrate, 156 mM citric acid, 375 mM NaOH, 661 mM sodium acetate trihydrate, 29% v/v\n1-propanol, pH 6.0) for 20 min . After the reaction, the reactant was mixed with 0.25 mL of\ncolor-developing reagent (246 mM 4-dimethylaminobenzoaldehyde, 35% v/vperchloric\nacid, 65% v/v2-propanol) and heated in a 60\u000eC water bath for 15 min. After cooling\nfor 3 min, the absorbance of the mixture was read at 558 nm, and total collagen content\nwas determined using a standard curve (hydroxyproline solution of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and\n2.4\u0016g/mL). Total collagen content was calculated using the following equation: Total\ncollagen (mg/g dry matter) = hydroxyproline ( \u0016g/mL)\u00027.25/1000/(sample weight/250).\n2.3.4. Instrumental Color Measurement\nThe instrumental color of the bone side surface on cooked samples was evaluated\nusing a colorimeter (Chroma meter, CR 400, Minolta, Osaka, Japan) with an illuminant C\nand a 2\u000estandard observer. The colorimeter was calibrated with a standard white plate\n(CIE L* = +93.01, CIE a* = \u00000.25, CIE b* = +3.50). Values for CIE L* (lightness), CIE a*\n(redness), and CIE b* (yellowness) of each sample were measured at six random locations,\nand the values were averaged [10].\n2.3.5. Cooking Loss\nCooking loss was expressed as the percentage weight difference between raw and\ncooked samples using the following equation: cooking loss (%) = (the weight before cooking\n(g)\u0000the weight after cooking (g)/the weight before cooking (g) \u0002100.\n2.3.6. Total Protein Solubility\nThe total protein solubility of the samples was measured in triplicate according to the\nmethod of Warner et al. [ 11]. The protein concentration of the sample was measured using\nthe Biuret method [ 12], and protein solubility was expressed as mg of soluble protein per g\nof sample (mg/g).\n2.3.7. Myo\ufb01brillar Fragmentation Index\nMyo\ufb01brillar fragmentation index (MFI) was measured in triplicate using the method\nof Olson and Stromer [ 13] with slight modi\ufb01cation. Four grams of the sample were\nhomogenized with 40 mL of isolation buffer (100 mM KCl, 20 mM K-phosphate, pH 7.0 ,\n1 mM NaN 3) for 30 s, then centrifuged at 1000 \u0002gfor 10 min and suspended at the\nresidues again with 20 mL of isolation buffer. Then, the same process was performed\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592 4 of 12\ntwice under the same conditions, and connective tissue was removed by \ufb01ltering with a\npolyethylene sieve of 18 mesh scale and then further centrifuged. After centrifugation, the\nmyo\ufb01brillar sediment was suspended again with 20 mL of isolation buffer, and the protein\nconcentration of the sediment suspension was measured using the Biuret method. The\nprotein concentration of myo\ufb01brillar sediment was diluted at 0.5 \u00060.05 mg/mL using\nthe isolation buffer, and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. MFI was expressed by\nmultiplying the absorbance value by 200.\n2.3.8. Shear Force\nFor shear force measurement, at least four rectangular parallelepiped shape samples\n(3.0 cm\u00021.0 cm\u00021.0 cm) were obtained from the middle portion of each cooked chicken\nbreast or from the M. iliotibialis lateralis in the thigh meat. The shear force was measured\nusing a texture analyzer (CT3 50K, AMETEK Brook\ufb01eld, Middleboro, MA, USA) equipped\nwith a V-shape Warner\u2013Bratzler shear force blade. The experimental condition was set to a\nmaximum load of 50 g and a test speed of 2 mm/s [14].\n2.3.9. Lipid Oxidation\nLipid oxidation was determined in triplicate according to the 2-thiobarbituric acid reac-\ntive substance (TBARS) method described by Buege and Aust [ 15] with minor modi\ufb01cation.\nFive grams of sample was mixed with 15 mL of distilled water and 100 \u0016L of 6% 2,6-di-tert-\nbutyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) and homogenized at 12,000 rpm for 15 s. Two milliliters of\nthe homogenate were reacted with 4 mL of TBA solution (20 mM 2-thiobarbituric acid in\n15% trichloroacetic acid). The mixture was heated at 80\u000eC for 15 min in a water bath and\ncooled in cold water for 10 min. After cooling, the sample was mixed and then centrifuged\nat 2000\u0002g(20\u000eC) for 10 min (Combi-514R, Hanil SME, Anyang, Republic of Korea). The\nsupernatant was \ufb01ltered through a \ufb01lter paper (Whatman no. 4), and the absorbance of the\n\ufb01ltrate was measured at 531 nm using a spectrophotometer (Libra S22, Biochrome, Cam-\nbridge, UK). The TBARS value was calculated using the following equation and expressed\nas mg of malondialdehyde per kg of the sample (mg MDA/kg sample): TBARS value (mg\nMDA/kg sample) = 5.3102 \u0002absorbance 531 nm + 0.0356.\n2.4. Statistical Analysis\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the measured variables using the\ntwo-way ANOVA procedure of the SPSS program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), in which\nthe main effects were considered sous-vide cooking conditions, muscle type, and their\ninteractions. Duncan\u2019s multiple range test was used to determine signi\ufb01cant differences\nbetween means ( p< 0.05).\n3. Results and Discussion\nChicken breasts and thighs clearly present different muscle characteristics due to their\nmuscle \ufb01ber composition [ 16,17]. Many previous studies have extensively compared the\nmeat quality attributes of chicken breasts and thighs [ 18,19]. Therefore, this study focused\non sous-vide cooking conditions and interaction effects on chicken breasts and thighs.\n3.1. pH and Color Characteristics of Sous-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh\nThe pH and color of chicken breast and thigh with different sous-vide cooking condi-\ntions (at 55/65\u000eC for 3/6 h) are shown in Table 1. No interaction between muscle type and\nsous-vide condition on pH value was found ( p> 0.05). The pH values of cooked chicken\nbreast and thigh were 6.07 and 6.37, respectively ( p< 0.05). However, the pH values were\nunaffected by the different sous-vide cooking conditions ( p> 0.05).\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592 5 of 12\nTable 1. pH and color characteristics of sous-vide cooked chicken breast and thigh.\nEffect pH ValueCIE L*\n(Lightness)CIE a*\n(Redness)CIE b*\n(Yellowness)\nMuscle effect\nBreast 6.07b81.44a3.39b14.71b\nThigh 6.37a75.14b4.48a15.35a\nSEM(1)0.036 0.499 0.175 0.192\nSous-vide effect\nControl (71\u000eC) 6.29 79.63 4.00b14.68d\n55\u000eC/3 h 6.20 78.09 5.12a13.65e\n55\u000eC/6 h 6.25 77.53 4.23b15.21d\n65\u000eC/3 h 6.19 78.23 4.04b14.92d\n65\u000eC/6 h 6.17 77.98 2.29c16.68c\nSEM 0.057 0.788 0.277 0.304\nMuscle\u0002Sous-vide interaction\nBreast\u0002Control 6.21 82.14 3.57 14.17BC\nBreast\u000255\u000eC/3 h 6.04 80.67 4.47 13.92BC\nBreast\u000255\u000eC/6 h 6.10 80.38 3.70 15.10B\nBreast\u000265\u000eC/3 h 6.01 81.04 3.60 14.97B\nBreast\u000265\u000eC/6 h 6.00 82.98 1.60 15.36B\nThigh\u0002Control 6.38 77.11 4.42 15.19B\nThigh\u000255\u000eC/3 h 6.36 75.51 5.78 13.38C\nThigh\u000255\u000eC/6 h 6.40 74.69 4.76 15.31B\nThigh\u000265\u000eC/3 h 6.36 75.42 4.47 14.87B\nThigh\u000265\u000eC/6 h 6.34 72.99 2.98 17.99A\nSEM 0.081 1.115 0.392 0.429\nSigni\ufb01cance of p-value\nMuscle effect <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 0.028\nSous-vide effect NS(2)NS <0.001 <0.001\nInteraction effect NS NS NS 0.012\n(1)SEM: standard error of the means.(2)NS: non-signi\ufb01cance (p \u00150.05).a,bMeans within the same column with\ndifferent letters between chicken muscles are signi\ufb01cantly different ( p< 0.05).c\u2013eMeans within the same column\nwith different letters between sous-vide cooking conditions are signi\ufb01cantly different ( p< 0.05).A\u2013CMeans within\nthe same column with different letters are signi\ufb01cantly different ( p< 0.05).\nA signi\ufb01cant interaction between sous-vide cooking condition and muscle type effect\nwas con\ufb01rmed only in CIE b* (yellowness) but not in L* (lightness) and a* (redness). The\ncooked chicken breast showed a higher lightness ( p< 0.05) but lower redness ( p< 0.05)\nand yellowness ( p< 0.05) as compared to cooked chicken thigh. Moreover, the redness and\nyellowness of cooked chicken breast and thigh were affected by the different sous-vide\ncooking conditions ( p< 0.001). During the thermal process, the denaturation of myoglobin,\na pigment-protein, begins at 55\u201365\u000eC, and as the temperature rises, more denaturation\nprogresses [ 20]. Thus, the increased temperature of sous-vide cooking decreases the redness\nof cooked chicken meat, which was similar to the results of previous studies on sous-vide\ncooked pork, beef, and goat meat [ 21,22]. In addition, Park et al. [ 1] reported that sous-vide\ncooking at 70\u000eC for 1 h resulted in lower redness of chicken breast compared to sous-vide\ncooking at 60\u000eC for 3 h.\nIn general, oxymyoglobin is denatured at 75\u201380\u000eC, causing browning, and thigh\nmuscle is known to have higher myoglobin content than breast muscle [ 23]. In the pre-\nvious study, the browning due to heating in thigh muscle with a high concentration of\noxymyoglobin progressed further, and there was a signi\ufb01cant difference in yellowness [ 23].\nTherefore, this result showed that the increased temperature and time of sous-vide cooking\ncould decrease redness but increase the yellowness of chicken meat, in which the yellow-\nness of chicken thigh meat was more sensitive to the change in the sous-vide cooking\nconditions than chicken breast.\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592 6 of 12\n3.2. Cooking Loss and Moisture Content of Sous-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh\nCooking loss and moisture content of the chicken breast and thigh muscles with\ndifferent sous-vide cooking conditions are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2, respectively. No\nsigni\ufb01cant interactions between muscle type and sous-vide cooking conditions on cooking\nloss and moisture content were found ( p> 0.05). Chicken breast and thigh showed similar\ncooking loss and moisture content ( p> 0.05). The lowest cooking loss (9.79%) of chicken\nmeat was observed for sous-vide cooking at 55\u000eC for 3 h, but sous-vide cooking at 65\u000eC\nfor 6 h caused the highest cooking loss ( p< 0.05). Moreover, the cooking loss of chicken\nmuscles increased as the cooking temperature and time increased. As a result, the lowest\nmoisture content of chicken meat was found in sous-vide cooking at 65\u000eC for 6 h ( p< 0.05;\nTable 2). Thus, the moisture content of chicken muscles tended to show opposite changes\nagainst cooking loss.\nFoods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 13 \n \n vide cooked pork, beef, and goat meat [21,22]. In addition, Park et al. [1] reported that \nsous-vide cooking at 70 \u00b0C for 1 h resulted in lower redness of chicken breast compared \nto sous-vide cooking at 60 \u00b0C for 3 h. \nIn general, oxymyoglobin is denatured at 75\u201380 \u00b0C, causing browning, and thigh \nmuscle is known to have higher myoglobin content than breast muscle [23]. In the previ-\nous study, the browning due to heating in th igh muscle with a high concentration of ox-\nymyoglobin progressed further, and there was a signi \ufb01cant di\ufb00erence in yellowness [23]. \nTherefore, this result showed that the incr eased temperature and time of sous-vide cook-\ning could decrease redness but increase the yellowness of chicken meat, in which the yel-\nlowness of chicken thigh meat was more sensitive to the change in the sous-vide cooking \nconditions than chicken breast. \n3.2. Cooking Loss and Moisture Content of So us-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh \nCooking loss and moisture content of the chicken breast and thigh muscles with dif-\nferent sous-vide cooking conditions are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2, respectively. No \nsigni\ufb01cant interactions between muscle type and sous-vide cooking conditions on cooking \nloss and moisture content were found ( p > 0.05). Chicken breast and thigh showed similar \ncooking loss and moisture content ( p > 0.05). The lowest cooking loss (9.79%) of chicken \nmeat was observed for sous-vide cooking at 55 \u00b0C for 3 h, but sous-vide cooking at 65 \u00b0C \nfor 6 h caused the highest cooking loss ( p < 0.05). Moreover, the cooking loss of chicken \nmuscles increased as the cooking temperature and time increased. As a result, the lowest \nmoisture content of chicken meat was found in sous-vide cooking at 65 \u00b0C for 6 h ( p < 0.05; \nTable 2). Thus, the moisture content of chicke n muscles tended to show opposite changes \nagainst cooking loss. \n \nFigure 1. Cooking loss of sous-vide cooked chicken breast  and thigh.

Control samples were cooked at 75\u000eC when the core temperature reached\n71\u000eC, sous-vide cooked samples were conducted at different conditions (temperature/time) under\nvacuum packaging.\nOne of the major factors affecting the water-holding capacity in cooked meat is\nthe shrinkage of the myo\ufb01brillar protein. Eighty percent of the moisture in the meat\nis held by myo\ufb01brillar proteins [ 24]. When myo\ufb01brillar protein is thermally denatured,\nit shrinks transversely at 40\u201360\u000eC, thus extending the space between myo\ufb01brillar, but at\n60\u201365\u000eC, longitudinal shrinkage occurs, causing signi\ufb01cant moisture loss [ 24]. According\ntoPark et al. [1] , the cooking loss of sous-vide chicken breast cooked at 70\u000eC was signif-\nicantly higher than sous-vide cooking at 60\u000eC, and the prolonged cooking time at the\nsame temperature markedly increased the cooking loss of sous-vide chicken breast. Thus,\nit seems that the increased cooking loss at 65\u000eC sous-vide chicken meat with decreasing\nmoisture content was likely due to the more severe shrinkage of muscle protein.\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592 7 of 12\nTable 2.

Total Collagen Content of Sous-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh\nThe total collagen content of sous-vide cooked chicken breast and thigh muscles is\nshown in Table 2. The total collagen content was signi\ufb01cantly different by muscle types and\nsous-vide cooking conditions ( p< 0.05), but there were no signi\ufb01cant interactions between\nmuscle types and sous-vide cooking conditions ( p> 0.05). One of the major changes in the\nheat treatment of meat is decreasing shear force by the solubilization of collagen, and in\nparticular, the heating temperature is a major factor in the decrease in hardness caused\nby collagen [ 25]. The denaturation temperature of collagen was reported from 53\u000eC to\n63\u000eC [26]. Moreover, according to Purslow [ 6], cooking at a slow heating rate, such as\nsous-vide heating, can cause denaturation of collagen between 55 and 60\u000eC. In this study,\nthe collagen content of sous-vide chicken also showed a signi\ufb01cant decrease in the 65\u000eC,\n3\u20136 h treatment than control, 55\u000eC 3 h treatment, resulting in collagen denaturation and\nsolubilization, resulting in a decrease in the residual collagen content.\n3.4. Total Protein Solubility of Sous-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh\nThe total protein solubility of sous-vide cooked chicken breast and thigh is shown in\nTable 2. No signi\ufb01cant interaction between muscle type and sous-vide cooking conditions\nwas found, and similar protein solubility was observed for both chicken breast and thigh\n(p> 0.05). The total protein solubility of chicken meat was highest in sous-vide cooking\nat 55\u000eC (p< 0.05); however, an increase in cooking temperature to 65\u000eC caused no\ndifference in the total protein solubility when compared to the control group ( p> 0.05).\nProtein solubility has been used as an indicator of the degree of protein denaturation, and\nprotein aggregation due to thermal denaturation decreases protein solubility [ 27]. Protein\ndenaturation is divided into two stages according to temperature. Most sarcoplasmic\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592 8 of 12\nprotein denaturation occurs at 40\u201360\u000eC, and myo\ufb01brillar protein denaturation occurs\nat 70\u201390\u000eC [7,27]. In this study, the protein solubility of chicken meat decreased as the\ncooking temperature increased. This observation was consistent with the results of previous\nstudies [ 28,29]. Thus, it seems that sous-vide cooking at 65\u000eC might have a greater impact\non the denaturation of myo\ufb01brillar proteins than that at 55\u000eC, while both temperatures\nare below the thermal denaturation temperature already known. According to Ayub and\nAhmad [ 30], myosin, a major myo\ufb01brillar protein, causes extensive denaturation when\nheated at 55\u000eC for 3 h. On the other hand, Martens et al. [ 31] reported that actin could be\ndenatured under cooking at 65\u000eC for 3 h. Thus, the reason for similar protein solubility\nbetween 3 and 6 h at the same cooking temperature was likely that sous-vide cooking for\n3 h might be enough to denature myo\ufb01brillar protein at each cooking temperature.\n3.5. Myo\ufb01brillar Fragmentation Index (MFI) of Sous-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh\nThe MFI of sous-vide cooked chicken breast and thigh was determined to compare the\ndifference in structural change (Table 2). The MFI of sous-vide cooked chicken was affected\nby muscle types ( p< 0.05), sous-vide cooking conditions ( p= 0.002), and their interaction\n(p= 0.003). The MFI of the control group was signi\ufb01cantly lower than sous-vide cooking\ntreatments ( p< 0.05). As the cooking temperature increased from 55 to 65\u000eC, the MFI of\ncooked chicken meat numerically decreased ( p> 0.05). However, the change in MFI due to\nthe increased cooking temperature was observed for only chicken breast ( p< 0.05), but the\ndifferent sous-vide cooking conditions had no impact on the MFI of chicken thigh ( p> 0.05).\nChanges in the MFI of chicken breast are mainly associated with actomyosin dissociation\nand Z-disc destruction. Previously, Wang et al. [ 32] reported that actomyosin dissociation\nin duck breast increased signi\ufb01cantly at 50\u000eC, peaked at 60\u000eC, and decreased rapidly at\n80\u000eC. In addition, Okitani et al. [ 33] reported that the dissociation of actomyosin showed a\nhigh level for up to 1 h when cooked at 60\u000eC, and the dissociated actin was insolubilized\nat 65\u000eC of cooking temperature. However, there was no signi\ufb01cant difference in MFI\naccording to the treatment group in the thigh muscle, which is presumed by other factors.\nIt has been reported that in the early stage of heating, inosine 50-monophosphate (IMP) or\nadenosine-50-monophosphate (AMP) dissociates actomyosin into actin and myosin more\nmarkedly at 60\u201365\u000eC than at 80\u000eC [33]. MFI may be affected by the content of AMP\nand IMP remaining in the muscle during heating. According to Jayasena et al. [ 34], the\nAMP content of chicken thigh muscle was more than twice as low as that of chicken breast\nmuscle ( p< 0.05), and the content of IMP was not signi\ufb01cantly different ( p> 0.05). Thus, the\ndifference in the MFI of the thigh muscle was not observed despite the change in heating\ncondition because the AMP content of the thigh muscle was low, and the dissociation of\nactomyosin was not large enough.\n3.6. Shear Force of Sous-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh\nThe shear force of sous-vide cooked chicken breast and thigh muscles is shown in\nFigure 2. No signi\ufb01cant interaction between muscle types and sous-vide cooking conditions\non the shear force was found ( p> 0.05). Sous-vide cooking at 65\u000eC could decrease the\nshear force of chicken meat ( p< 0.05), but sous-vide cooking at 55\u000eC had no impact on\nthe shear force ( p> 0.05). In addition, there was no signi\ufb01cant difference in the shear\nforce due to cooking time within the same temperature ( p> 0.05). Thermal treatment of\nmeat causes several changes, including myo\ufb01brillar protein denaturation and shrinkage,\nwhich contribute to the increased shear force of cooked meat [ 27]. In general, both cooking\ntemperature and time affect the tenderness of meat, but the cooking temperature has\na greater effect on myo\ufb01brillar protein shrinkage than cooking time [ 26]. According to\nBarbanti and Pasquini [ 35], the decrease in shear force during cooking was mainly due to\nthe solubilization of the connective tissue, whereas denaturation of myo\ufb01brillar protein\nled to an increase in shear force. Therefore, the shear force increase of 55\u000eC treatment in\nchicken breast and thigh muscles was caused by the denaturation of myo\ufb01brillar protein.\nHowever, the causes of shear force reduction in 65\u000eC treatment of chicken breast and thigh\nFoods 2023 ,12, 2592 9 of 12\nmuscles are estimated to be caused by different factors. The decrease in the shear force of\nmeat is mainly due to the solubilization of intramuscular connective tissue such as collagen.\nIn this study, the collagen content of sous-vides chicken muscles was signi\ufb01cantly lower\nat 65\u000eC 6 h, which is consistent with the shear force reduction trend of 65\u000eC treatment.\nAlso, according to the report by Baldwin [ 24], a slow change caused by sous-vide cooking\ndissolves collagen, denatures it into gelatin, and improves tenderness by reducing adhesion\nbetween muscle \ufb01bers. Regarding the difference in shear force between chicken breast\nand thigh, it is well known that the difference in meat quality between chicken breast and\nthigh meat is due to muscle \ufb01ber composition, but the results of instrumental tenderness\ndifferences were not consistent in previous studies [ 36,37]. This may be due to postmortem\ntime and cooking methods [37].\nFoods 2023 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 13 \n \n  \nFigure 2. Shear force of sous-vide cooked chicken breast and thigh.

Lipid Oxidation of Sous-Vide Cooked Chicken Breast and Thigh \nThe lipid oxidation stability of sous-vide cooked chicken breast and thigh were de-\ntermined with a TBARS assay (Figure 3). No signi \ufb01cant interaction between muscle types \nand sous-vide cooking conditions on TBARS value was found ( p > 0.05). Sous-vide cook-\ning at 55 \u00b0C resulted in the lowest TBARS values ( p < 0.05). In each muscle, an increase in \nsous-vide cooking temperature increased the TBARS value ( p < 0.05), and di \ufb00erent cook-\ning times had no impact on the TBARS value of chicken breast ( p > 0.05). The change in \nTBARS values due to di \ufb00erent cooking temperatures may be related to the inactivation of \nendogenous antioxidant enzymes in the meat or the formation of antioxidative com-pounds. Mei et al. [38] reported that heating temperatures above 60 to 70 \u00b0C could inacti-\nvate endogenous antioxidant enzymes in the meat, resulting in rapid lipid oxidation. In \nthis study, however, in the thigh muscle, TBARS values decreased at 65 \u00b0C for 6 h, which \nmight be due to the additional reaction of oxidation products. Malondialdehyde produced \nby lipid oxidation is highly reactive [39] and reacts with compounds present in meat, such as amino acids [40]. In this regard, the decreased TBARS values in the thigh muscle with \nincreasing cooking time were previously reported by Del Pulgar et al. [21]. Moreover, it is \nthought that this phenomenon, observed for only the thigh muscle, might be associated \nwith a high concentration of myoglobin, potentially one of the initiators of lipid oxidation. \nThe fact that the formation of metmyoglobin can accelerate the lipid oxidation of meat has been well documented [41]. In this regard, the thigh muscle contains more myoglobin than \nthe breast muscle, and this would produce a more severe oxidative environment. a\nbca\naa\nabb\ncdb\nd\n0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0\nChicken breast Chicken thighShear force (kg)Control 55\u00b0C/3h 55\u00b0C/6h 65\u00b0C/3h 65\u00b0C/6h\nFigure 2.
