We utilized  \nSTATA version 17.0 to carry out all statistical  analyses  (Stata Corporation,  College Station, TX, US). The \nrandom  effects model was used to calculate  the overall effect size ES and CI. \nFindings:  Ten eligible review papers with 8610 participants  studied the in\ufb02uence  of magnesium  on SBP \nand DBP. The pooling of their effect sizes resulted  in a signi\ufb01cant  reduction  of SBP (ES = -1.25 mmHg; 95% \nCI: -1.98, -0.51, P = 0.001) and DBP (ES = -1.40 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.04, -0.75, P = 0.0 0 0) by magnesium  sup- \nplementation.  In subgroup  analysis,  a signi\ufb01cant  reduction  in SBP and DBP was observed  in magnesium  \nintervention  with dosage \u2265400 mg/day (ES for SBP = -6.38 mmHg; ES for DBP = -3.71mmHg),  as well as \nin studies with a treatment  duration  of \u226512 weeks (ES for SBP = -0.42 mmHg; ES for DBP = -0.45 mmHg).  \nImplications:  The \ufb01ndings  of the present umbrella  meta-analysis  showed  an overall decrease  of SBP and \nDBP with magnesium  supplementation,  particularly  at doses of \u2265400 mg/day for \u226512 weeks. \n\u00a92 0 2 4 The Author(s).

Meta- \nanalysis  articles  examining  the effects of magnesium  on blood \npressure  (SBP and DBP) in humans  with reported  effect sizes (ESs) \nand con\ufb01dence  intervals  (CI), were included  in the current  um- \nbrella meta-analysis.  Moreover,  observational  studies,  case reports,  \ncontrolled  clinical  trials, prospective  studies,  studies  with a \u201clow \nquality\u201d score,  and articles  in languages  other than  English were  \nexcluded.  Methodological  quality assessment  and grading  of the evidence  \nTwo independent  researchers  utilized  the A Measurement  Tool \nto Assess Systematic  Reviews  (AMSTAR)2  questionnaire  to eval- \nuate the methodological  quality  of eligible  meta-analyses.  24 This \ntool contains  16 items that require  referees  to answer  \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cPar-  \ntial Yes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d or  \u201cNo Meta-analysis.\u201d The  AMSTAR2  list was cate- \ngorized  into \u201chigh quality,\u201d \u201cmoderate  quality,\u201d \u201clow  quality,\u201d and  \n\u201ccritically  low quality.\u201d We  appraised  the general  strength  and \nquality  of evidence  using GRADE  based on the Cochrane  Handbook  \nof systematic  reviews  of interventions.  25 \nStudy selection  and data extraction  \nTwo independent  investigators  reviewed  the papers to select \nthose ful\ufb01lling  the eligibility  criteria  and discrepancy  was resolved  \nby the corresponding  author.  The following  items were extracted  \nfrom the included  articles:  year of publication,  \ufb01rst author\u2019s  name, \nstudy location,  sample  size, magnesium  supplementation  dosage,  \nand effect sizes and CIs for SBP and DBP. \nData synthesis  and statistical  analysis  \nWe utilized  STATA version  17.0 to carry out all statistical  anal- \nyses (Stata Corporation,  College  Station,  TX, US). To calculate  the \noverall ES and Cis, the random-effects  model was used. Hetero-  \ngeneity  among  studies  was assessed  using the I2 statistic  and \nCochrane\u2019s  Q-test, with a P < 0.1 or I2 value > 50% regarded  as \nsigni\ufb01cant.  Subgroup  analyses  were conducted  to detect potential  \nsources  of heterogeneity  based on the reported  median  predeter-  \nmined variables,  namely  duration  of intervention  and magnesium  \nsupplementation  dosage.  We applied  sensitivity  analyses  to survey \nthe in\ufb02uence  of any particular  effect size removal  on the combined  \nresults.  Formal  Egger\u2019s  tests and funnel plots visual checking  were \nalso performed  to detect publication  bias, with a P -value < 0.05 \nregarded  as meaningful.  \nResults  \nStudy characteristics  \nFigure 1 shows the \ufb02ow diagram  of the literature  search \nprocess.  507 papers were recovered  in the electronic  database  \nsearches,  out of which 178 were excluded  for being duplica-  \ntions. After screening  the titles and abstracts  of the remaining  \n329 publications,  315 articles  were removed.  Ultimately,  10 meta- \nanalyses  published  between  2002 and 2021 were included  in \nthe umbrella  meta-analysis,  amounting  to a total of 8610 partici-  \npants. 21 , 22 , 26\u201329 , 19 , 30\u201332 Mean magnesium  dose varied from 364 to \n440 IU/day,  and intervention  duration  ranged  between  8.85 and \n14.54 weeks. Detailed  characteristics  of the included  meta-analyses  \nare outlined  in Table 1 .

Egger\u2019s  tests and \nvisual inspection  of the funnel plots showed  no sign of publication  \nbias ( Figure 4 ). \nDiscussion  \nThe present  umbrella  meta-analysis  on the effect of magne-  \nsium supplementation  on blood pressure  summarized  the results \nof 10 meta-analyses.  The \ufb01ndings  of this assessment  support  the \nevidence  that magnesium  supplementation  lowers DBP and SBP \nin a statistically  signi\ufb01cant  manner,  although  the effect size is \nsmall, hence, suggesting  the potential  use of magnesium  as part \nof the dietary  interventions  for the management  of hypertension.  \nAlthough  cost-utility  analyses  are lacking,  magnesium  supplemen-  \ntation could potentially  reduce the economic  costs of hypertension  \ntreatment.  Su\ufb03cient  evidence  demonstrates  the link between  hy- \npertension  and various  chronic  diseases,  33 but further  investiga-  \ntions are warranted  to study the effects of magnesium  supplemen-  \ntation on other chronic  diseases.  Magnesium  is one of the most common  minerals  in the hu- \nman body, with 99% of it distributed  intracellularly.  34 The role of \nmagnesium  in reducing  hypertension  has been attributed  to mul- \ntiple mechanisms  of action, including  acting as a calcium  channel  \nblocker,  competing  with sodium  binding  sites on vascular  smooth  \nmuscle  cells, decreasing  intracellular  sodium  and calcium,  enhanc-  \ning prostaglandin  E, binding  cooperatively  with potassium,  induc- \ning vasodilation,  improving  endothelial  dysfunction  in diabetic  and \nhypertensive  patients.  35 Moreover,  magnesium  induces  nitric ox- \nide release  from endothelial  cells, which acts as vasoactive  medi- \nator and produces  a synergistic  effect with antihypertensive  med- \nications.  36 The effect of magnesium  on osteopontin  has also been \nproposed  to be one of the mechanisms  involved  in inhibiting  vas- \ncular calci\ufb01cation  and reducing  BP. 37 \nAccording  to our umbrella  meta-analysis,  magnesium  supple-  \nmentation  resulted  in a statistically  signi\ufb01cant  decrease  in SBP \n(ES = -1.25 mmHg;  95% CI: -1.98, -0.51, P = 0.001) and DBP (ES = - \n1.40 mmHg;  95% CI: -2.04, -0.75, P = 0.0 0 0). Similar  results have \nbeen obtained  by several  meta-analyses,  including  a meta-analysis  \nof 11 RCTs conducted  by Asbaghi  et al. with magnesium  doses \nranging  from 36.49 to 500 mg/day  and intervention  duration  of \n4 to 24 weeks, which reported  a signi\ufb01cant  reduction  of SBP and \n5\nA.M. Alharran, M.M. Alzayed, P. Jamilian et al. Current Therapeutic Research 101 (2024) 100755\nDBP, 21 as well as one by Dibaba  et al. which reported  that admin-  \nistration  of 365 to 450 mg/day  of elemental  magnesium  resulted  in \na reduction  of SBP by 4.18 mmHg and DBP by 2.27 mmHg,  27 and \nother meta-analyses.  38 \nIn contrast  with our study results,  Verma et al. reported  that \nmagnesium  supplementation  provides  a moderate  bene\ufb01cial  im- \npact on SBP but not on DBP, 22 which could be because  their meta- \nanalysis  on hypertension  included  only four studies,  with a high \nheterogeneity  among  those studies.  Song et al. reported  that mag- \nnesium  supplementation  did not provide  bene\ufb01cial  effects on SBP \nand DBP, 30 however,  the study population  of the meta-analysis  in- \ncluded only patients  with type 2 diabetes  mellitus,  which could be \nthe reason for this con\ufb02icting  result; moreover,  the main focus of \nthe study was the effect of magnesium  on glycemic  control  rather \nthan blood pressure.  \nAccording  to The American  Food and Nutrition  Board, the rec- \nommended  dietary  magnesium  intake for people aged 31\u201370 years \nis 420 mg/day  for males and 320 mg/day  for females.  39 In our \nsubgroup  analysis,  a signi\ufb01cant  reduction  in SBP and DBP was ob- \nserved in magnesium  supplementation  with doses \u2265400 mg/day  \nand treatment  duration  \u226512 weeks. In line with our results,  a \nmeta-analysis  conducted  by Asbaghi  et al. reported  in their sub- \ngroup analysis  that magnesium  supplementation  at a dose of > 300 \nmg/day  or with a duration  of > 12 weeks provided  signi\ufb01cant  ben- \ne\ufb01cial effects on both SBP and DBP. 21 In another  meta-analysis,  \nmagnesium  supplementation  of > 370 mg/day  resulted  in SBP re- \nduction  by 0.66 mmHg and DBP reduction  by 0.57 mmHg.  19 \nThe reduction  in BP due to magnesium  supplementation  could \nhave bene\ufb01cial  effects on cardiovascular  outcomes.  A clinical  trial \nreported  that 0.8 to 2 mmHg reduction  of SBP could help in de- \ncreasing  the risks of coronary  artery disease,  stroke, and heart fail- \nure, with a 2 to 3 mmHg decrease  of BP reducing  the risk of stroke \nby up to 6 to 12%. 40 Hence, the reduction  of BP by magnesium  sup- \nplementation,  although  not enough  to recommend  magnesium  as \nan antihypertensive  monotherapy,  could have clinical  signi\ufb01cance  \nwhen used as a dietary  supplement  in addition  to other antihyper-  \ntensive  medications  in subjects  with hypertension.  \nClinical  Implications  \nOur umbrella  meta-analysis  of randomized  controlled  trials re- \nvealed that magnesium  supplementation  signi\ufb01cantly  reduced  SBP \nand DBP. Hence, magnesium  supplementation  can be used in con- \njunction  with antihypertensive  medications  to cause a signi\ufb01cant  \ndecrease  in blood pressure.  \nStrengths  and Limitations  \nTo the best of our knowledge,  this is the \ufb01rst umbrella  meta- \nanalysis  to \ufb01nd the effect of magnesium  supplementation  on BP. \nWe performed  subgroup  analysis  based on the dose and duration  \nof magnesium.  Since our review included  only meta-analyses  of \nRCTs, bias was signi\ufb01cantly  reduced.  In addition,  Egger\u2019s  test and \nvisual inspection  of the funnel plot revealed  no publication  bias. \nHowever,  our review is not without  limitations.  Signi\ufb01cant  het- \nerogeneity  was found among  the included  meta-analysis,  and the \ndose and duration  of magnesium  interventions  in patients  with \nspeci\ufb01c  comorbidities  were not reported.  Thus, we recommend  \nthat future studies  focus on the effects of magnesium  supplemen-  \ntation on blood pressure  in patients  with comorbidities.  Moreover,  \noverlapping  is unavoidable  in any umbrella  review which is an- \nother limitation  of this review.  \nConclusion  \nThe \ufb01ndings  of the present  umbrella  meta-analysis  showed  a \nsmall but statistically  signi\ufb01cant  decrease  of SBP and DBP with magnesium  supplementation,  with signi\ufb01cant  effects with doses \n\u2265400 mg/day  and duration  \u226512 weeks. Although  the reduction  of \nBP by magnesium  supplementation  is not enough  to recommend  \nits use as monotherapy  for hypertension,  it could have clinical  sig- \nni\ufb01cance  when used as a dietary  supplement  in addition  to other \nantihypertensive  medications  in patients  with hypertension.  Fur- \nther studies  are required  to determine  the effects of magnesium  \nsupplementation  on BP in patients  with comorbidities.  \nDeclaration  of competing  interest  \nNo con\ufb02ict  of interest  to declare.  \nFunding  \nNone. \nAuthor  Contributions  \nA .M.A ., P.J., H.K.-V.,  and A .A .-Z. carried  out the concept,  design,  \nand drafting  of this study.
