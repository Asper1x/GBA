Although iron supplements can be highly effective\nat improving iron status and preventing iron de\ufb01ciency anemia, iron may adversely affect growth and\ndevelopment, and may increase risk for certain infections. Several reviews exist in this area; however,\nnone has fully summarized all reported outcomes of iron supplementation during infancy. In this\nreview, we summarize the risks and bene\ufb01ts of iron supplementation as they have been reported in\ncontrolled studies and in relevant animal models. Additionally, we discuss the mechanisms that may\nunderly bene\ufb01cial and adverse effects.\nKeywords: infant nutrition; iron supplement; iron de\ufb01ciency anemia; growth; neurodevelopment;\noxidative stress; trace mineral interactions; gut microbiome\n1. Introduction\nIron is an essential trace element for human life: basic cellular reactions like energy\nproduction and DNA replication require iron, and in mammals, iron transports oxygen\nin the blood as hemoglobin. Insuf\ufb01cient iron intake to meet basic metabolic requirements\nleads to de\ufb01ciency. Iron de\ufb01ciency (ID) affects 10\u201340% of infants and causes approximately\n50% of anemia cases worldwide [1\u20133].\nInfants are especially susceptible to ID and iron de\ufb01ciency anemia (IDA), both of which\ndisrupt health and development [ 2\u20135], including adverse effects on long-term cognition\nand behavior. Once an infant becomes iron de\ufb01cient, correcting iron status through dietary\nintervention prevents anemia, but may not correct disruptions to neurodevelopment and\nlong-term cognitive development because critical phases of brain development occur\nduring infancy [6,7].\nConcern about the harms of ID has led to routine use of iron supplements to prevent\nID [4,5]. Iron supplements, whether iron drops, multi-nutrient packets (MNPs), forti\ufb01ed\nformula, or forti\ufb01ed complementary foods, are effective at preventing or treating ID in\nmost infants. Based on the success of iron supplements for preventing ID and IDA, the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) recommends that iron supplements are provided to\ninfants in populations where anemia prevalence exceeds 40% [ 4]. The same rationale backs\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 (AAP) recommendations that exclusively breast-fed\ninfants receive iron supplements beginning at 4 months, and that formula-fed infants\nreceive iron-forti\ufb01ed formula [5].\nThe vast difference in iron intake\u2014between the iron supplemented infant and the\nun-supplemented infant receiving only breast milk\u2014is important but generally under-\nrecognized. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for iron for infants 0\u20136 months is 0.3 mg\nper day, based on the amount provided in breast milk [ 8]. For healthy infants born at term,\nliver iron stores in combination with the small amount provided in breast milk supports\nhealthy growth and development up to 6 mo [ 9\u201311], but most forti\ufb01ed formulas in the\nUSA contain 40\u0002more iron than breast milk [ 12]. Even after accounting for differences in\nbioavailability between breast milk iron and formula iron, formula still provides around 7 \u0002\nmore absorbable iron than breast milk. Furthermore, the AAP recommends 1 mg iron/kg\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14204380 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 2 of 16\ndaily supplementation for all exclusively or primarily breast-fed infants [ 5]. Following\nthese recommendations, an iron-supplemented 5 kg infant would receive 17 \u0002more iron\nthan what is provided by breast milk.\nThe WHO and AAP recommendations may lower the risk of ID, but infants with\nlow risk of ID who receive iron supplements may be at risk of adverse effects, including\ndisrupted growth and neurodevelopment, adverse nutrient interactions, and increased\nmorbidity and mortality [ 13\u201317]. The mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear\nand must be investigated for the risks of iron to be characterized; to predict which infants\nare the most vulnerable to which outcomes; and to improve ef\ufb01cacy and safety of iron\nprovision [18,19].\nExisting reviews in this area are of high quality [ 13\u201315,17,20], but they do not provide\na full overview of outcomes that have been observed in controlled human and animal\nstudies. The purpose of this review will be to summarize outcomes of iron supplementation\nbetween birth and 12 months in infants, as well as the corresponding developmental stage\nin animal models. With the goal of identifying the most promising directions for future\niron intervention research, we discuss likely biological mechanisms underlying risks and\nbene\ufb01ts of iron supplementation during infancy.\n2. De\ufb01ciency & Toxicity\nCurrently, the WHO recommends that infants age 6\u201323 months of age receive addi-\ntional iron wherever anemia prevalence is estimated to be >40% [ 21]. Their recommenda-\ntion is based on evidence from a meta-analysis of anemia outcomes [ 20]\u2014part of a large\nsystematic review by Pasricha et al.\u2014which showed that iron was effective at increas-\ning hemoglobin ( p< 0.00001 for overall effect) and reducing risk of anemia for infants\n(0.61 relative risk; p< 0.00001 for overall effect) (see Appendix Figure A1) [ 20]. Reductions\nin anemia prevalence following iron provision are attributed to improvements in iron status,\nbecause risk of ID is typically also reduced [ 20]. Nevertheless, it is necessary to re-evaluate\niron prophylaxis and its dose in infant populations\u2014especially those living in areas of low\nrisk of IDA\u2014despite effective anemia prevention, because studies have reported adverse\ndevelopmental outcomes of iron provision based on the current recommendations [ 22\u201326].\n2.1. De\ufb01ning Anemia\nIt is also necessary to re-evaluate the clinical de\ufb01nition of anemia for infants. The\nglobal cutoff for infants and children under 5 years (<110 g Hb/L) has been unchanged\nsince it was de\ufb01ned in a 1968 WHO technical report on nutritional anemias [ 27,28]. The\ntechnical report cites infant data from two studies published in 1954 and 1959 [ 29,30], both\nof which included relatively small samples of infants ( n= 237 and n= 129, respectively). In\ntheir current guide for assessing anemia [ 27] the WHO states their cutoff was \u201cvalidated\u201d by\nsurvey data collected in 1976\u20131980 during the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey II (NHANES II), published by the United States Center for Disease Control &\nPrevention (CDC) in 1989 [ 27,31]. The CDC\u2019s anemia cutoffs were derived from the 5th\npercentile Hb values, calculated from a \u201cnationally representative sample\u201d ( n= 979) of\n\u201chealthy\u201d children 1\u20132 years old [ 31]. Notably, no Hb values were assessed in infants\nunder 12 months old during this survey [ 31,32]. In summary, the current de\ufb01nition of\nanemia for infants is based on very limited evidence; therefore it is necessary to reconsider\npopulation-level iron recommendations designed around preventing anemia.\n2.2. De\ufb01ning Iron De\ufb01ciency\nHb de\ufb01nes anemia but is not a speci\ufb01c biomarker for iron status [ 2]. Speci\ufb01c iron\nbiomarkers are serum ferritin (SF), serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), trans-\nferrin saturation, zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) [ 2].\nTable 1 lists commonly used biomarkers as well as their cutoffs and their response to iron\nsupplementation. Based on NHANES II data, the CDC recommends three biomarkers are\nused (ZPP , sTfR & SF), where at least two abnormal values would indicate ID [ 33]; however,\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 3 of 16\noften it is not feasible for clinicians to measure three biomarkers of iron in infants and young\nchildren. Instead, SF is used in combination with Hb to detect IDA. For anemic infants and\nchildren under 5 years of age, IDA is diagnosed when ferritin is <12\u0016g/L [34]. SF is a good\nbiomarker for iron but also an acute phase protein that is elevated during systemic in\ufb02am-\nmation and thus may mask the presence of ID. Therefore, the WHO recommends a higher\nSF cutoff (<30 \u0016g/L) to diagnose ID in infants in the presence of infection [ 34]. Researchers\nmay assess in\ufb02ammatory status alongside SF (e.g., C-reactive protein) to determine the\nvalidity of SF values; however, this method has not yet been standardized and the overall\nvalidity of SF as a biomarker for iron status during infancy remains uncertain [35].\nTable 1. Common biomarkers for de\ufb01ning anemia and iron de\ufb01ciency in infants.\nBiomarker Anemia CutoffIron\nDe\ufb01ciency CutoffResponse to Iron\nSupplementationReferences\nHemoglobin <110 g/L - \"or no change [27\u201332]\nSerum Ferritin1- <12 \u0016g/L \" [33\u201335]\nTransferrin Saturation1- <10% \" [32,33]\nZinc Protoporphyrin - 80 \u0016mol/mol heme # [33]\nSoluble Transferrin Receptor - 8.3 mg/L # [33]\n1Also elevated by inflammation [ 33].\", Increased with iron supplementation; #, decreased with iron supplementation.\nConcrete evidence remains limited surrounding iron assessment and anemia diagnosis\nin infants, as well as the prevalence of infant ID or IDA. Thus, current practices for assessing\niron status of infants and diagnosing ID or IDA rely on biomarker cutoffs that were de\ufb01ned\nby outdated, poor-quality evidence. Nevertheless, if one assumes these cutoffs are reliable,\nthen there is evidence that: (1) there is high prevalence of IDA among toddlers 1\u20133 years of\nage [ 2]; (2) ID or IDA during infancy is associated with poorer developmental outcomes,\nparticularly outcomes related to the nervous system and cognitive development [ 7]; (3) as\nstated above, controlled iron supplementation trials show reduced risk for ID and IDA [ 20].\nHowever, whether iron supplementation improves and prevents poorer development\noutcomes is still unclear [15,20,36].\n2.3. Iron Supplementation, Iron Status, & Hematology\nThere are inherent limitations to diagnosing ID and IDA during infancy, but there\nis good evidence that providing additional dietary iron will improve iron status. This is\nfurther supported by animal models: increased Hb, SF, transferrin saturation and serum\niron, as well as increased liver iron concentration (a direct measure of iron stores) have\nbeen observed in swine, rats and mice. Studies in animal models support that Hb and iron\nbiomarkers are elevated by iron supplementation but depend on baseline iron status as\nwell as the dose, duration and form of iron supplementation.\nDomesticated pigs are born without suf\ufb01cient iron stores and must receive exogenous\niron to prevent anemia (de\ufb01ned as <90 g Hb/L). Typically, 100\u2013200 mg iron is administered\nto piglets during the \ufb01rst week of life as a single intramuscular or subcutaneous injection\nof iron dextran [ 37]. In one neonatal piglet study, non-supplemented piglets were severely\nanemic (mean Hb 72 g/L) by postnatal day (PD) 8, but piglets that had received an\niron dextran injection or 5 days of oral iron had normal Hb levels (99 g/L and 100 g/L,\nrespectively). SF, TIBC and serum iron, as well as spleen, liver, heart and kidney iron\nlevels were also signi\ufb01cantly elevated compared to non-supplemented piglets. Notably,\ngreater iron loading in spleen, liver and kidney was observed in the iron dextran group\ncompared to the oral iron group [ 38]. A small study from our group also found that non-\nsupplemented piglets became severely anemic by PD 14, but iron dextran injections (100 mg\niron) or oral iron (10 mg iron/kg BW as ferrous sulfate drops) prevented anemia at this\nage [ 39]. Similar results were reported in other pig studies [ 40\u201343]. Recently, in a larger and\nmore robustly designed study where the control group received vehicle supplementation\nwithout additional iron, Hb was similar at PD 14 between control and iron-supplemented\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 4 of 16\ngroups; anemia was observed at PD 35 only in the control group (82 g Hb/L), suggesting a\nlong-term effect of iron supplementation [ 44]. The smaller effect of iron on Hb in the latter\nstudy [ 44] compared to the previous studies [ 38,39] may be explained by the differences in\niron dose (1 vs. 10 or 15\u201320 mg iron/kg BW, respectively).\nRodent studies show that iron supplementation prior to weaning increases body iron\nlevels, but effects on hematology are inconsistent [ 45\u201354]. Our group observed that in rat\npups with ID, induced by a maternal low iron diet, iron supplementation corrected Hb\nand tissue iron levels [ 45]. Other studies show that hematopoiesis in rodents that were\nnot ID at birth was either increased or unchanged by iron supplementation. Varying the\niron dose produces variation in hematology and iron status outcomes, suggesting that\niron intake levels affect hematopoiesis [ 39,41,44,46]. In summary, the extent to which iron\nsupplementation improves iron stores and Hb in the pre-weanling animal depends on\nbaseline iron status as well as the dose and type of iron administered.\n2.4. Developmental Regulation of Iron\nHomeostatic mechanisms control iron availability in early life, and postnatal growth\nnecessitates rapid expansion of blood volume which increases demand for iron (Figure 1).\nErythropoietin (EPO) is synthesized by the kidney in response to low oxygen or ID. Through\nendocrine signaling, EPO drives erythropoiesis and increases erythroferrone (ERFE) pro-\nduction in the bone marrow. ERFE signaling ensures that there is suf\ufb01cient iron available for\nheme synthesis and RBC production by promoting iron absorption and increases circulating\nlevels of iron, which is accomplished through suppression of hepcidin transcription in\nhepatocytes. Conversely, the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin is upregulated by bone mor-\nphogenic protein (BMP6) signaling in response to iron sensing by hepatic endothelial cells\u2014\nin the absence of suppression by ERFE [ 55,56]. Hepcidin blocks ferroportin-mediated iron\nexport in enterocytes, iron-storing hepatocytes, and spleen reticuloendothelial macrophages\nresulting in reduced iron circulation in the blood. This also leads to reduced iron absorption\nin the small intestine. The hepcidin-ferroportin axis serves as the systemic regulatory\nmechanism that prevents iron toxicity from dietary overexposure [ 57,58]. However, re-\ncent evidence suggests that this mechanism is not functionally mature in infants: Iron\nabsorption is not well regulated in response to iron over-supplementation during the \ufb01rst\nyear of life [ 9,10]. The same appears to be true for pre-weanling mice [ 59], rats [ 45,60] and\npiglets [ 39]. These animal studies show that intestinal ferroportin is hypo-responsive to\nhepcidin-induced degradation and permits elevated iron absorption during early develop-\nment, despite substantial hepatic iron deposition [ 39,45,48,59,60]. This suggests infants are\nmore vulnerable to iron overload.\n2.5. Oxidative Stress Results from Iron Overload\nIron is a pro-oxidative element and iron overload in cells disrupts the oxidative balance\nby generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Iron catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen\nperoxide into the highly oxidizing species hydroxyl radical. Iron overload thereby causes lipid,\nprotein and DNA oxidation, which can ultimately result in cell death. This type of cell death\ncaused by iron-induced lipid peroxidation and ROS accumulation is termed ferroptosis [ 61,62].\nMutations in the hepcidin-ferroportin pathway cause hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an\niron overload disease that demonstrates the pathological effects of iron toxicity . During HH,\niron accumulates in the liver, where extreme iron overload initiates fibrosis, then cirrhosis and\nloss of liver function [ 63,64], eventually leading to complications and death if untreated [ 63,64].\nIn HH patients, liver fibrosis is believed to result from iron-induced oxidative stress [ 65]. Iron\noverload leads to extrahepatic iron loading, negatively affecting functions of other tissues.\nThus, iron overload resulting from blunted regulation of iron absorption in early life may\nexplain how excess iron can be harmful to development, but whether excess iron in early\nlife causes tissue iron overload and oxidative stress remains to be investigated. Iron-toxicity\ninjuries to developing organs like the liver would explain delays in growth and other adverse\neffects of iron supplementation in young children [10,13].\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 5 of 16\nFigure 1. Iron regulation in the infant in response to iron supplementation. TOP\u2014Iron regulation in\nthe breast-fed infant in the absence of iron supplementation ( 1) The kidney secretes erythropoietin\n(EPO) to support the expansion of blood volume in response to low iron and low oxygen sensing;\n(2) EPO enters circulation and travels to the bone marrow, ( 3) where it drives erythropoiesis and\nsecretion of erythroferrone (ERFE); ( 4) ERFE travels to the liver and suppresses hepcidin (HAMP)\nproduction, which allows for increased transferrin-bound iron in circulation; suppression of HAMP\nallows export of iron from the ( 5) spleen via ferroportin, as well as increased intestinal absorption\nof iron through ferroportin, both of which further increases iron in circulation. BOTTOM\u2014Iron\nregulation in response to iron supplementation: ( 1) iron from supplementation is absorbed through\nthe duodenal mucosa, is picked up by transferrin, and travels to the liver ( 2), increasing iron stores\nand up-regulating HAMP; ( 3) HAMP enters the circulation; ( 4) transferrin-bound iron supports\nincreased erythropoiesis; in the spleen ( 5) erythrocytes are recycled but iron is sequestered because\nHAMP prevents export through ferroportin; ( 6) elevated iron and blood volume suppresses EPO\nproduction in the kidney.\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 6 of 16\nOne double-blinded RCT investigated whether the amount of iron in formula alters\nblood markers of oxidative stress in infants [ 66]. Infants consuming 4 mg iron/L (as lactoferrin\nand FS) had greater plasma glutathione peroxidase activity (a marker of antioxidant activity)\nthan those receiving more iron (6.9 mg iron/L as FS). The higher activity may have been due\nto higher levels of selenium in the 4 mg iron/L formulas, because selenium is a required\ncomponent of glutathione peroxidase. When controlling for copper and selenium, there was\nno difference in glutathione peroxidase activity due to iron levels. Another RCT in Sweden\nand Honduras found that daily iron supplementation from 4\u20139 mo of age (at 1 mg/kg body\nweight, the current recommended dose) reduced plasma copper-zinc superoxide dismutase\n(SOD) activity , which is an antioxidant marker as well as an indicator of copper status [26].\nFew other studies in human infants have reported effects on oxidative stress markers,\nbut animal studies provide some insight. Nearly all iron supplementation studies that have\nmeasured oxidative stress in pre-weanling animal models have focused on oxidative stress\nin the CNS [ 39,48,49,53,67\u201374]. Our group observed no signi\ufb01cant effect on hippocam-\npal oxidative stress in pre-weanling rats or weanling piglets [ 39,48]. Dong et al. found\nthat in piglets\u2014which are born with ID\u2014iron supplementation decreased expression of\npro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines in the liver and spleen while increasing expression of genes\ninvolved in anti-oxidative activity [ 38]. Intriguingly, this effect was unique to the piglet\ngroup orally receiving ferrous glycine chelate iron, while the iron dextran injection group\nactually had increased expression of interleukin-1 \fand had no effect on antioxidant gene\nexpression in the liver. Although both forms of iron had similar effects on Hb and SF,\ninjection of iron dextran further increased hepatic and extrahepatic iron loading, and this\nlikely contributed to the elevated in\ufb02ammatory and oxidative stress markers [ 38]. Inconsis-\ntent oxidative stress effects have been observed in various brain regions in aging rodents\nfollowing excess neonatal iron supplementation [ 49,53,67,69\u201374]. Few studies assessed\ntissue iron content or iron status when determining long-term oxidative stress effects of\nneonatal iron exposure. Kaur et al. observed increased oxidative stress in the substantia\nnigra (SN) of aged mice (12 mo) but not young adult mice (2 mo) following neonatal iron\nexposure, and this was associated with increased SN iron levels and reduced CNS motor\ncircuit (nigrostriatal) activity [ 49]. Additional studies in human infants and animal models\nare necessary to understand how the pro-oxidative effects of iron might play a role in the\ngrowth and development outcomes of iron supplementation.\n3. Growth & Development\n3.1. Growth Effects of Dietary Iron Excess\nControlled studies have shown that iron supplementation of iron-replete infants neg-\natively impacts their growth [ 22,24,75], but this effect has not been consistent in all stud-\nies [20,76]. A randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) reported iron supplementation from\n4\u20139 mo reduced length-gain and head circumference-gain to 9 mo in Swedish infants who\nhad low risk of ID [ 22]. A separate RCT in Indonesia found that iron provision reduced\nweight-for-age and length-for-age z-scores of iron-replete infants [ 24]. Another RCT in South\nEast Asia found that iron supplementation from 6 to 12 months reduced length-for-age,\nbut only in infants who had a healthy birth weight at baseline [ 75]. However, a more re-\ncent RCT from our group did not find any effects on growth metrics for healthy, full term\nSwedish infants from 6 weeks to 6 months [ 77]. It should be noted, though, that the previous\nthree studies [22,24,75] all provided iron as drops, whereas the latter one provided iron in\ninfant formula. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies in\nchildren age 4\u201323 months reported negative effects of iron on weight and length gain [ 20],\nwhile another systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in children age 6\u201323 months did\nnot find an effect on growth [ 76]. The difference in age of introduction of iron supplementation\nmay explain this discrepancy\u2013considerably more iron may be absorbed during 4\u20136 months of\nage when regulation of iron absorption is immature [ 9,10]. Yet, another comparable review\nand meta-analysis will investigate growth effects in iron-replete infants [ 36]. To date, there are\ninsufficient studies to conclude the effect of iron supplementation on the growth of healthy,\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 7 of 16\niron-replete infants. Nevertheless, the finding that iron is disruptive to growth in some cases\ndemands further investigation into these effects.\n3.2. Neurodevelopmental Outcomes of Iron Supplementation\nThe cognitive and behavioral effects of iron administration are also inconsistent [ 15]. Iron\nprovision may prevent ID-related disruptions to nervous system development, but may be\nharmful to iron-replete infants, leading to long-term cognitive and behavioral deficits [ 78,79].\nA well-powered, double-blind RCT conducted in Chile observed improved iron status\nand metrics of behavioral and social development in infants fed high-iron formula levels\n(12 vs. 2.3 mg iron/L as FS) from 6\u201312 mo of age. However, the pooling of breast-fed\nand formula-fed groups and the poor control of iron intake in this study muddles the\ninterpretation of these results [ 80,81]. Moreover, despite exclusion of infants with IDA,\nID may have been common at baseline. A follow-up study found increased response to\nreward, language abilities, and motor function in 10-year-olds who had been pooled into\nthe high-iron group as infants. The authors did not report whether baseline iron status\nor estimated daily iron intake in\ufb02uenced behavioral outcomes of iron provision [ 82]. An\nadditional follow-up study of this trial reported adverse cognitive and behavior effects\nin 16-year-olds who had received high-iron formula during infancy [ 79]. A small RCT in\nCanada found a positive effect of iron on Bayley\u2019s scores of cognitive development [ 83],\nbut iron intake from formula was poorly controlled and drop-out rates relatively high in\nthis study. Another small RCT in Spain found that adding iron to cow\u2019s milk improved the\niron status of infants who were already iron-replete at baseline, but did not affect mental\nand psychomotor development metrics [ 84]. Thus, the impact of iron supplementation on\nlong-term cognitive function is still unclear.\nIdeally, supplement dose would be determined by an infant\u2019s baseline iron status and\noptimized for healthy brain development, but this requires robust, well-powered studies.\nUnfortunately, few well-powered studies have measured baseline iron status or stratified\nresults according to baseline iron status. One follow-up [ 78] of the same RCT above [ 80,81]\nfound that after exclusion of anemic infants, baseline Hb predicted the effects of formula iron\n(12 vs. 2.3 mg/L) on cognitive development scores: infants with higher hemoglobin levels at\nbaseline had poorer development scores at 10 years of age if they received high-iron formula,\nwhile infants with lower hemoglobin at baseline had improved development scores [78].\nIn a meta-analysis of RCTs, Pasricha et al. found that iron supplementation of all\nchildren aged 4\u201323 months did not affect Bayley\u2019s mental or psychomotor development\nscores. Indeed, they observed a positive effect on Bayley scores when iron was provided to\niron-de\ufb01cient children, but stated there were insuf\ufb01cient well-powered studies to conclude\nwhether iron provision is bene\ufb01cial or harmful to iron-replete infants [ 20]. An upcoming\nsystematic review from Hare et al. and meta-analysis may provide further insight on this\nmatter [ 36]. Animal studies provide some compelling evidence that excess iron is harmful\nto brain development and leads to long-term cognitive and psychomotor de\ufb01cits (discussed\nbelow); however, more human studies are needed to con\ufb01rm these effects [15].\n3.3. Mechanisms Underlying Neurodevelopmental Effects of Iron Supplementation\nIron is required not only for postnatal proliferation and differentiation of the central\nnervous system (CNS)\u2014which begins prenatally and continues postnatally\u2014but also for\nCNS-speci\ufb01c pathways, including neurotransmitter synthesis and myelination [ 85]. Brain\nregions with greater metabolic need for iron are programmed to import iron more rapidly\nthan other regions. By this reasoning, such regions may permit excess iron loading and\nin\ufb02uence susceptibility to iron toxicity-induced oxidative stress. Oxidative stress damages\nCNS cells by triggering apoptosis, ferroptosis and necrosis.\nThe adult hippocampus is heavily myelinated, and the infant hippocampus requires\nrelatively large amounts of iron because myelin synthesis is iron-demanding and peaks\nat this age. Myelin sheaths in the CNS are formed by oligodendrocytes, which wrap their\nmyelin around neuronal axons, surrounding and insulating them to reduce axon resistance\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 8 of 16\nand accelerate signaling speed. Oligodendrocytes and their precursors must import and\nstore suf\ufb01cient iron for myelination, which is why ID leads to insuf\ufb01cient myelination. This\nmay explain how ID during infancy leads to long-term cognitive and behavioral de\ufb01cits;\nhowever, myelination is only one of many iron-demanding processes that take place in the\nCNS during the \ufb01rst year of life [86].\nOne study in pre-weanling rats observed that excess iron increased total iron content\nin the cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, thalamus, deep cerebellum and pons, but not\nin the striatum at PD 21. In contrast, supplying iron after weaning increased iron in the\nhippocampus and pons at PD 35, but not in other regions. Moreover, pre-weanling rats\nsupplemented through PD 35 had elevated iron levels in the cortex, hippocampus, pons\nand super\ufb01cial cerebellum [ 54]. These \ufb01ndings provide evidence that brain regions are\ndifferentially affected by iron supplementation.\nAnother study investigated how the timing of excess iron exposure affected oxidative\nstress in various brain regions. A gastric gavage of iron (10 mg iron/kg BW as ferrous\nsuccinate) was administered daily to rats PD 5\u20137, PD 10\u201312, PD 19\u201321 (pre-weaning), or PD\n30\u201332 (post-weaning), and brain regions were assessed for oxidative stress at 3\u20135 mo of age\n(adulthood) [ 73]. They observed that pre-weanling iron exposure caused oxidative stress\nin the hippocampus, cortex and substantia nigra, suggesting a lasting effect of early life\nbrain iron accumulation. Furthermore, CNS oxidative stress in this study was associated\nwith impaired recognition memory. The hippocampus is part of the brain circuitry that\nencodes learning and memory\u2014including spatial mapping and social cognition\u2014and was\nalso the region most consistently affected by oxidative stress in this study. The results\nfrom this study [ 73] are in agreement with recent studies from our group in piglets [ 39,87]\nand suggest that excess iron provision causes iron loading and oxidative stress in the\nhippocampus, associated with adverse effects on long-term cognitive function.\nIn a long-term animal study, oxidative stress was measured in brain regions of aging\nrats that were exposed to excess iron as neonates (oral gavage of 120 mg iron/kg BW as\ncarbonyl iron). They found that pre-weanling iron overexposure elevated substantia nigra\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) content (a marker for lipid peroxidation) and reduced glutathione\ncontent (a marker for antioxidant activity) at PD 400. These changes were associated with\nreduced dopamine neurotransmitter content in the striatum, as well as alterations in motor\nbehavior, suggesting that excess iron in early life may lead to long-term dysfunction of the\nnigrostriatal pathway , a brain circuit involved in controlling movement, memory and response\nto reward [ 68]. Additional animal studies are needed to confirm these effects; however, these\nfindings are congruent to cognitive and behavior effects in human infants [78].\n4. Trace Mineral Interactions\n4.1. Iron De\ufb01ciency May Mask Copper or Zinc De\ufb01ciency\nProlonged copper or zinc de\ufb01ciency leads to iron de\ufb01ciency. Copper is a required\ncomponent of hephaestin and ceruloplasmin, which operate as co-transporters of iron [ 88].\nCopper de\ufb01ciency progressively diminishes the activity of these co-transporters, thereby\nreducing intestinal iron absorption, which causes iron de\ufb01ciency. Similarly, zinc de\ufb01ciency\nreduces iron absorption by suppressing the expression of the iron importer DMT1 and the\niron exporter ferroportin [89\u201391].\nIn cases when ID derives from copper or zinc deficiency , iron supplementation would not be\nan effective treatment, as iron intake may be sufficient. Conversely , excess dietary trace mineral\nintake, such as excess iron, can affect absorption and metabolism of other trace minerals [92].\n4.2. Iron Competes with Other Trace Minerals for Absorption & Metabolism\nExcess iron may disrupt absorption and metabolism of other trace minerals. In a\nsecondary analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, serum zinc decreased in\ninfants after 6 months of iron supplementation, but only in infants that were iron-replete at\nbaseline (6 months). However, a study in non-anemic Kenyan infants did not \ufb01nd an effect\non serum zinc or zinc absorption with the addition of iron in micronutrient powder [ 93].\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 9 of 16\nCopper-zinc superoxide (CuZnSOD) dismutase activity, a marker of copper status, was\nreduced in iron vs. placebo-supplemented infants at 9 months; however, no effect on\nserum copper was observed [ 26]. Insuf\ufb01cient research exists to ascertain that excess iron\nin\ufb02uences infant zinc and copper status, but similarities in biochemistry and pathways of\nabsorption among iron, zinc, copper and manganese may explain how excess iron intake\nwould disrupt trace mineral metabolism.\nA pre-weanling rat supplementation study from our group demonstrated that tissue\nlevels of zinc, copper, and manganese were altered by excess iron supplementation [ 46]. Pre-\nweanling rats with high iron intake had reduced liver copper levels and elevated levels of\nzinc in the liver, kidney, brain, and intestine compared to a vehicle control group. Prolonged\nsupplementation with excess iron reduced zinc and copper levels in rat brains, reduced\nzinc and manganese in spleen tissue and caused elevated zinc in the liver. Lower levels of\niron supplementation affected trace mineral levels to a lesser extent in the pre-weanling\nrats, suggesting that excess early life iron supplementation stimulates dysregulation of\ntrace mineral metabolism. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to determine how\nand when excess iron in\ufb02uences or disrupts trace mineral status in infants.\n4.3. Trace Minerals and Oxidative Stress\nThe transporters DMT1, ZIP8, and ZIP14 import divalent metals including iron, copper,\nzinc, and manganese [ 45,94\u201396], therefore it is possible that high levels of iron may out-\ncompete other divalent metals for import, and this may explain alterations in availability\nof these minerals in response to excess iron supplementation. Likely a secondary effect\nof cellular iron loading is the upregulation of trace metal binding and storage proteins\nsuch as copper-zinc SOD, manganese SOD, metallothioneins (MT) and ceruloplasmin (CP).\nMTs, CP , and copper-zinc or manganese SODs require these metals to function as ROS\nscavengers and their upregulation is induced by oxidative stress. By this reasoning iron\nloading may upregulate antioxidant, metal-binding proteins including MTs, SODs and\nCP by inducing oxidative stress. Since zinc and copper are needed for basic metabolism,\ngrowth and resistance to infection, disrupting their availability to growing organs and\ntissues would disrupt development and health [ 8]. However, it remains to be investigated\nif mineral interactions in the context of excess iron are linked to the adverse growth and\ndevelopment effects of excess iron.\n5. Morbidity & Mortality\n5.1. Iron Affects Morbidity & Mortality of Infants & Children\nApproximately 90% of iron from FS, a common iron supplement, remains in the\ngastrointestinal (GI) tract until it is excreted [ 9]. The GI side effects of FS iron supplements\nare well-established: after pooling data from 43 studies, a meta-analysis of GI side effects\nof FS for adults estimated an 11% incidence rate for nausea, 12% for constipation and 8%\nfor diarrhea [ 97]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that 1 in 3 adults\nwho received FS supplementation experiences some adverse effects [ 98]. It seems likely\nthat infants would be affected similarly, but this has not been fully investigated.\nIron provision has been associated with increased risk of diarrhea and respiratory infection\nin some studies [ 17,20]. If excess iron increases infection risk, this may explain how growth is\nnegatively affected by iron supplementation in some cases [ 22,24,75]. A previous study from\nour group found that diarrhea frequency increased and growth was reduced for infants in\nSweden and Honduras who had normal Hb levels at baseline, while the opposite was true\nfor infants who were anemic at baseline [ 22]. For many studies reporting no effect of iron\nsupplementation on diarrhea frequency , results are not stratified according to baseline iron\nstatus (provided that baseline iron status was measured in the study) [ 99\u2013104]. One recent\nstudy found that infants who were treated with antibiotics experienced greater frequency of\ndiarrhea if they were also receiving MNP with iron, as compared to infants who were treated\nwith antibiotics while receiving MNP without iron, as part of a larger double-blinded RCT [ 25].\nIncreased iron availability in the gut may have increased the proliferation of diarrhea-causing\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 10 of 16\nClostridium difficile in infants receiving high-iron formula and iron drops [ 105]. The bioavailability\nof iron (i.e., the extent to which iron is absorbed or passed through the gut) may be influenced\nsignificantly by intervention methodology: supplementation vs. fortification with iron, form of\niron used, and timing of iron administration [ 9,11,17]. In their review of diarrhea outcomes [ 17],\nGhanchi et al. suggested that supplementation may increase risk for diarrhea when compared\nto fortification; conversely , more expensive forms of iron (such as NaFeEDTA) may lower the\nrisk for diarrhea compared to iron salts. Furthermore, common foods introduced as part of\nthe complementary diet after 6 months of age influence iron absorption: grains, beans, and\nlegumes contain indigestible phytates that reduce iron bioavailability , and citric or ascorbic\nacids in foods can augment iron absorption [ 106]. However, there are still an insufficient\nnumber of comparative studies to define the safest iron intervention methods for infants. In\nsummary , current evidence suggests that baseline microbiota, iron status and iron intervention\nmethodology are essential for predicting whether iron may increase morbidity in infants.\n5.2. Gut Development & the Gut Microbiota\nAlterations to the gut microbiota may contribute to GI side effects of iron supplements,\nas well as growth and development outcomes. Infancy is a critical period for symbiotic gut\nmicrobiota colonization and recent studies show that iron supplements alter the gut micro-\nbiota in ways that may be unfavorable to infant GI health [ 23,105,107,108]. Enteropathogens\ninvade more easily during this age due to immature barrier function of the intestinal mu-\ncosa [ 109], leading to diarrhea or other infections [ 17,110]. Bacteria translocating across the\nmucosa trigger pro-in\ufb02ammatory signaling, perhaps leading to diarrhea, both of which are\nlikely to impair the nutrient absorption capacity of the GI tract [ 111]. Prolonged GI in\ufb02am-\nmation or diarrhea might therefore reduce an infant\u2019s growth rate, suggesting GI effects are\nmechanistically related to adverse growth and development effects of excess iron.\nAn important aspect of development involves healthy colonization of the gut with\ncommensal microbes, because the gut microbiota provides essential roles to their host\u2019s\nhealth and development [ 112\u2013114]. Besides maternal microbiota and birth method, the\ninfant diet is the major determinant of gut colonization [ 114\u2013117]. Breastfeeding and breast\nmilk support healthy gut microbiota development by providing prebiotic oligosaccharides\nthat preferentially craft the infant gut so that it is dominated by commensal Bi\ufb01dobacterium\ninfantis , which serves multiple health and development roles [ 118\u2013121].Bi\ufb01dobacterium\ninfantis has been shown to suppress the proliferation of pathogens and improve the integrity\nof the mucosal barrier, preventing in\ufb02ammation and diarrhea [ 121]. Multiple studies have\nshown that iron reduces the abundance of commensal bacteria (including Bi\ufb01dobacterium\ninfantis ) and elevates pathogen-associated bacteria [ 16,25,107]. Since commensal gut bac-\nteria are so important for health and development, disrupting healthy colonization with\ncommensals might explain some adverse outcomes of iron [ 108,112,122]. The gut micro-\nbiome of iron-replete infants may be more adversely affected by iron, but only one study\nhas investigated gut microbiota outcomes in healthy, iron-replete infants [105].\nA double-blind RCT of iron in micronutrient powder (MNP) given to Kenyan infants\nfound increased abundance of Clostridium and Escherichia/Shigella \u2013including increased\npathogenic strains of E. coli \u2013as well as elevated calprotectin, a measure of GI in\ufb02amma-\ntion [ 23]. An additional robustly designed, double-blinded placebo controlled trial tested\nthe effects of iron in MNP which was provided to 6-months old Kenyan infants for 3 months.\nIn contrast to infants who received MNP without iron, infants who consumed MNP with\niron had reduced abundance of commensal bacteria Bi\ufb01dobacterium over time, while main-\ntaining the abundance of Escherichia [107]. Another study from this group that was part of\na large double-blind RCT in Kenya concluded that the addition of galacto-oligosaccharides\n(GOS) to the MNP with iron prevented its adverse effects on the microbiome. Despite the\nsmall sample size in this study, the results provide compelling evidence that iron adversely\nalters microbiome development by disruption of colonization by commensal bacteria [ 108].\nA separate analysis that was part of this RCT followed gut microbiota changes and diar-\nrhea outcomes in infants participating in the trial that had to be treated with antibiotics.\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 4380 11 of 16\nAntibiotics were not as effective at suppressing the growth of enteropathogens or reduc-\ning diarrhea incidence in infants who were receiving MNP with iron, as compared to\nantibiotic-treated infants receiving MNP without iron [ 25]. These \ufb01ndings suggest that\ninfants receiving iron supplements would be more susceptible to enteropathogens and\nhave more diarrhea despite antibiotic treatment [35].\nDisruptions to gut microbiota development lead to adverse effects on infant health,\nincluding alterations to GI development, metabolic signaling, brain development and\nimmune system development [112,122]. Therefore, further studies are necessary to de\ufb01ne\nhow excess iron-induced alterations to gut microbiota development during infancy impact\ninfant health and growth [ 13,16]. Considering that infant gut microbiota development is\nso important for overall development and that increased iron levels in the gut may cause\nadverse GI side effects and gut microbiota dysbiosis, it seems likely that the gut microbiota\nis involved in the adverse development effects of excess iron. Additional studies in animal\nmodels should characterize effects of excess iron on gut microbiota development and\ngenerate hypotheses about iron-induced alterations to the microbiota that may be causing\nadverse health and development outcomes.\n6. Conclusions\nOur conclusions are summarized graphically in Figure 2. Iron supplementation during\ninfancy improves iron status, thereby reducing the risk of developing ID or IDA. However,\nthe capacity of exogenous iron provision to disrupt health and development of otherwise\nhealthy infants who are iron-replete is unclear because few existing studies have speci\ufb01cally\nmeasured iron status at baseline. Further, translationally optimized animal models are\nneeded to investigate the mechanisms behind the adverse effects to infant health. Excess\niron provision may delay growth and neurodevelopment and increase susceptibility to\ndisease and infection, and it is likely that iron toxicity, mineral interactions and alterations\nin the gut microbiota are behind these outcomes.\nFigure 2.
