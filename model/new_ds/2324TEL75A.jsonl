In this\nspecific group, increased muscle mass, the acute effects of exercise, and the use of creatine may affect the\ncreatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcr), potentially leading to an underestimation of\nthe GFR. Cystatin C equations offer a more accurate prediction of GFR that is independent of muscle mass.\nWe aimed to assess the renal functions of bodybuilders who use both AAS+DS, as well as those who only use\nDS, by calculating the GFR based on cystatin C (eGFRcys) and also using a combination of cystatin C and\ncreatinine (eGFRcys/cr).\nMethods\nThe study included 12 bodybuilders using AAS+DS and 12 bodybuilders using DS. In both groups, serum\ncystatin C levels, eGFRcys, eGFRcys/cr, urine albumin excretion rates, urine protein excretion rates, and\nroutine tests were examined.\nResults\nIn AAS+DS users, the average duration of AAS use was 3.08\u00b12.02 years, while for DS users, the duration of\nsupplement use was 3.67\u00b12.49 years. The spot urine albumin/creatinine and protein/creatinine ratios were\nhigher in AAS+DS users (p<0.001 and p=0.006, respectively). Although eGFRcr was found to be similar in the\nAAS+DS and DS groups (119.67 \u00b1 24.12 ml/min and 122.08 \u00b1 18.03 ml/min, respectively; p=0.426), eGFRcys\nand the eGFRcys/cr ratio were significantly lower in the AAS+DS group compared to the DS group (eGFRcys:\n120.67 \u00b1 19.48 ml/min vs. 122.08 \u00b1 18.03 ml/min, p=0.039; eGFRcys/cr: 121.83 \u00b1 20.62 ml/min vs. 126.33 \u00b1\n21.163 ml/min, p= 0.036, respectively).\nConclusion\nCystatin-based GFR values were found to be significantly lower in AAS+DS users, and urinary albumin and\nprotein excretion were considerably higher compared to DS users. Although these findings suggest a\npotential link between early kidney damage and the direct use of AAS, the topic requires further\ninvestigation.\nCategories:\n Nephrology, Substance Use and Addiction, Sports Medicine\nKeywords:\n glomerular filtration rate, renal side effects, diet supplements, bodybuilders, anabolic androgenic steroids\nIntroduction\nPerformance-enhancing substances (PES) are commonly used by sportspeople to improve athletic\nperformance or physical appearance. One of the best-known of these substances is anabolic androgenic\nsteroids (AAS) \n[1]\n. These drugs have been used in the last five decades to increase muscle mass in\nbodybuilders and people who want masculine physiques and to intensify exercise regimes \n[2]\n. In recent\nyears, AAS consumption in Western countries has been increasing among young people \n[3, 4]\n.\nIn addition to AAS use, some diet supplements (DS) sold in the market are proposed to improve\nathletic/physical performance. The most frequently used non-hormone supplements are protein powder,\nvitamins, and creatine. Despite some of these substances being used as supplements to replenish nutrients\nlost during physical activity, others mimic the effects of AAS and may have similar associated effects \n[1]\n.\nThe continuous use of AAS for therapeutic purposes may involve some side effects and health problems. The\nknown general side effects of AAS include hypertension, accelerated atherosclerosis, reduced fertility, liver\ntoxicity, and immune system suppression \n[5]\n. Athletes use these drugs in 8-12 week cycles, and these\n1\n2\n3\n1\n \nOpen Access Original\nArticle\n \nDOI:\n 10.7759/cureus.43058\nHow to cite this article\nOzkurt S, Ozakin E, Gungor H, et al. (August 07, 2023) Assessment of Renal Function of Bodybuilders Using Anabolic Androgenic Steroids and\nDiet Supplements. Cureus 15(8): e43058. \nDOI 10.7759/cureus.43058\ngeneral side effects are not well-documented in athletes. The renal side effects of these drugs are less known.\nThe renal side effects of these drugs became a topic of curiosity after Herlitz LC et al. showed the association\nof focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and proteinuria after long-term use of AAS in a cohort\ncomposed of 10 bodybuilders \n[6]\n.\nA high-protein diet (300-550 g/day) is known to increase the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and has been\nexperimentally reported to cause glomerular hyperfiltration and FSGS \n[7]\n. Creatine powders are believed to\nbe effective in increasing exercise tolerance and muscle power and are considered safe for use at 20-25 g/day\nfor a 5-day loading phase, followed by a 5 g/day maintenance dose \n[8, 9]\n. There are few reports related to the\nside effects of creatine powders; these are generally about acute renal injury developing due to\nrhabdomyolysis linked to intense exercise \n[10]\n.\nEndogenous biomarkers are widely used to estimate GFR. Serum creatinine continues to be the most\ncommonly used biomarker for this purpose. Recently, the combination of cystatin C and creatinine has been\nshown to be the best approach for calculating GFR based on endogenous biomarkers \n[11, 12]\n.\nIn bodybuilders, high muscle mass may cause serum creatinine values to be measured higher than they\nactually are, leading to falsely elevated serum creatinine levels and, consequently, falsely low GFR values.\nEquations using estimated GFR (eGFR) measured with creatinine have proven validity for most patients, but\ntheir accuracy has not been confirmed for those with extremely muscular body composition. Additionally,\nsince many of these patients take creatine supplements, and creatine is easily converted to creatinine, using\ncreatinine measurements to estimate GFR in this population may create a potential problem \n[13]\n.\nCystatin C, produced at a fixed rate by all nucleated cells, has no clear diurnal rhythm within the day. Its\nfixed production rate, free release from glomeruli, and lack of influence due to body muscle mass make it a\nmore sensitive parameter for assessing GFR than creatinine. Additionally, cystatin C serum levels do not\ndisplay variation linked to age and sex \n[14, 15]\n.\nIn this study, we aimed to assess the renal functions of bodybuilders using AAS+DS and DS alone by\ncalculating GFR based on cystatin C and the combination of cystatin C and creatinine.\nMaterials And Methods\nParticipants\nThe study included 24 male volunteers aged 25-35 years (12 bodybuilders using AAS+DS and 12\nbodybuilders using DS) attending gyms in Eski\u015fehir. The mean age of AAS+DS users was 32.33 \u00b1 5.12 years,\nBMI was 27.07 \u00b1 2.53 (kg/m\u00b2), the mean age of DS users was 29.50 \u00b1 4.77 years, and BMI was 25.65 \u00b1 1.76\n(kg/m\u00b2). Those with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease history were excluded from\nthe study.\nThe study was permitted by Eski\u015fehir Osmangazi University Clinical Research Ethics Committee on May 20,\n2019, with decision number 22. The Republic of T\u00fcrkiye Ministry of Health, Turkey Pharmaceuticals and\nMedical Devices Agency granted permission on August 1, 2019, dated 66 175679-5 14.99-E.120952.\nAll participants gave informed consent.\nQuestionnaire and data collection\nVolunteers were asked about the types, amounts, and duration of AAS and DS they used, along with\nstimulants (like amphetamines and cocaine), smoking and alcohol habits, sociodemographic characteristics,\nsports and physical activity, and any side effects of the agents used.\nAdditionally, participants had their blood pressure and heart rate measured after a minimum of 5 minutes of\nrest.\nRenal ultrasound and dimensions of both kidneys were examined by a lecturer certified in the use of\nultrasound. Imaging was done using a 3.5-5 MHz convex probe with a Samsung HS50 Hybrid ultrasound\nmachine. The kidneys were examined in both longitudinal and transverse scan planes, with the transducer\nplaced in the flanks.\nSample analysis\nBlood and urine samples taken for routine tests were analyzed on the same day. Full blood count was\nexamined with a Sysmex XN-1000 using full blood samples in K2EDTA. Blood samples for routine\nbiochemistry tests were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 g and after separation were studied with a Cobas\n702 modular autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with the colorimetric method using\navailable commercial kits.\nSerum samples had TSH and total testosterone examined with a Cobas 801 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics,\n2023 Ozkurt et al. Cureus 15(8): e43058. DOI 10.7759/cureus.43058\n2\n of \n10\nMannheim, Germany) with the electrochemiluminescence immune method (ECLIA).\nFull urine tests were studied with microscopy and chemical strip analyses using an FUS 200 urine analyzer\n(Iris Diagnostics, Chatsworth, CA, USA).\nFor cystatin C, blood samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000 g and serum samples were stored at -\n80 degrees until analysis.\nTotal protein in urine samples was analyzed using the turbidimetric method, while albumin was examined\nwith the immunoturbidimetric method. Creatinine tests were conducted using the kinetic colorimetric Jaff\u00e9\nmethod with a Cobas 501 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).\nMeasurement of human serum cystatin C levels\nIn serum, cystatin C measurements were performed with a BioVendor brand Human Cystatin C Elisa Kit\nbrand Human Cystatin C ELISA measurement kit (BioVendor R&D, Cystatin C ELISA, RD191009100).\nAbsorbance was read with a Chromate 4300 brand ELISA reader device (Awareness Technology, Inc. Martin\nHwy., USA). Results are given as mg/L.\nStatistics\nContinuous data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD, and categorical data are given as percentages (%). The fit of\nthe data to a normal distribution was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparison of groups with normal\ndistribution used the independent samples t-test analysis for situations with groups numbering two.\nComparison of groups without normal distribution used the Mann-Whitney U test for groups of two.\nAnalysis of the cross tables used the Pearson chi-square and Pearson exact chi-square analyses. To\nimplement the analyses, the IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) program was used. For\nstatistical significance, p<0.05 was accepted as the criterion.\nResults\nFor both groups, age, BMI, educational level, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP),\nheart rate, and weekly meat consumption amounts were similar, as summarized in Table \n1\n.\n \nAAS+DS\nDS\nP-value\nAge (years)\n32.33 \u00b1 5.12        \n29.50 \u00b1 4.77\n0.184 *\nBMI (kg/m\u00b2)\n27.07 \u00b1 2.53\n25.65 \u00b1 1.76\n0.207 *\nEducation level (high school/university)\n2/10 (16.7%/83.3%)\n1/11 (8.3%/91.7%)\n1.00 ***\nSystolic blood pressure (mm/Hg)\n122.10 \u00b1 15.03\n117.18   \u00b1 22.96 \n0.194 *\nDiastolic blood pressure (mm/Hg)\n71.20 \u00b1 7.95        \n69.55 \u00b1 12.69\n0.104 *\nHeart rate (beats/min)\n72.70 \u00b1 11.22\n78.64 \u00b1 12.10\n0.889 *\nMeat consumption (kg/wk)\n3500.0 \u00b1 1804.3 \n2000.00 \u00b1 1723.6\n0.289 **\nRight kidney length (cm)\n10.60 \u00b1 0.98                        \n10.20 \u00b1 1.22                        \n0.128 *\nLeft kidney length (cm)\n10.71 \u00b1 1.12                        \n9.78 \u00b1 0.83                          \n0.617 *\nTABLE\n 1: Physical examination findings and demographic characteristics of the participants.\n* Independent sample t-test\n**Mann-Whitney U test\n*** Fisher exact Chi-square test\nAAS: Anabolic androgenic steroid; DS: Dietary supplement.\nThose using AAS+DS used AAS for 3.08\u00b12.02 years, while DS users used them for 3.67\u00b12.49 years (p=0.906).\nTable \n2\n summarizes the types of AAS used, weekly AAS amounts, and durations for patients using AAS.\n2023 Ozkurt et al.

AAS+DS users\ndrank alcohol at social levels, and DS users were similar. Half AAS+DS users smoked, while DS users were\nnot identified to smoke (Table \n3\n).\nCases using AAS+DS were found to have significantly higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST),\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) compared to DS users (p<0.001 for each). Lactate\ndehydrogenase (LDH) levels were within the normal interval, though higher for AAS users (p=0.006).

In contrast,\nAAS+DS users had lower eGFR values based on cystatin C and the combination of cystatin C and creatinine.\nThose using AAS+DS had higher total proteinuria and albuminuria, though values were within the normal\nreference interval.\nThough several adverse health effects secondary to taking anabolic steroids are well known, renal injury,\nespecially linked to FSGS, is less recognized. For the first time, Herlitz LC et al. reported 10 patients with a\ndiagnosis of FSGS due to a combination of post-adaptive glomerular changes developing as a result of direct\nnephrotoxic effects potentially due to increased fat-free body mass and anabolic steroid use in bodybuilders.\nThey proposed that this complication was not sufficiently recognized due to the expected increase in serum\ncreatinine due to increased body mass in bodybuilders \n[6]\n.\nAlmukhtar SE et al. performed renal biopsies on four bodybuilders with kidney dysfunction taking anabolic\nsteroids, commercial protein, and creatine products. They reported acute tubular necrosis, with chronic\ninjury findings like >30% interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in two biopsies. These findings were\nproposed to emphasize the risk of acute and potentially chronic renal injury among young men using\nanabolic steroids and excessive amounts of nutritional supplements \n[16]\n.\nDuring a six-year period, El-Reshaid W et al. performed a renal biopsy on 22 adult men with a high-protein\ndiet and AAS or growth hormone (GH) use. In eight cases, FSGS was identified, four had\nnephroangiosclerosis, three had chronic interstitial nephritis, two had acute interstitial nephritis, two had\nchronic interstitial nephritic nephrocalcinosis, and one patient each had membranous glomerulopathy,\ncrescentic glomerulopathy, and sclerosing glomerulonephritis. It has been reported that patients with FSGS\nhave a longer exposure time, late presentation, and a worse prognosis. In comparison, those with interstitial\ndisease have a shorter exposure time and earlier presentation, and renal function improves or stabilizes after\ndiscontinuation of applications \n[17]\n.\nThe normal value for GFR is influenced by age, sex, and body size, and there can be significant differences\neven among healthy individuals, with values around 130 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 for men and 120 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2\nfor women, respectively \n[18]\n. The normal albumin excretion rate is less than 10 mg per day \n[19]\n. Increased\nalbuminuria is the earliest biomarker for underlying microvascular disease in the kidneys, and an increase in\nalbuminuria over time is known to be associated with a loss of GFR \n[20]\n.\nFSGS develops as an adaptive process in obese patients with larger body mass causing glomerular\nhyperfiltration, leading to mechanical difficulty and scarring over time. The increasing BMI of bodybuilders\nis thought to contribute to secondary FSGS development \n[6, 21]\n. In our study, participant BMI was 25-30\nkg/m2, so participants were not obese, and both groups had similar BMI.\nThough the potential effects of AAS on renal functions in humans are not well-defined, several studies\nshowed that androgens may have direct toxic effects on glomerular cells and led to the consideration that\nthis may cause mesangial matrix accumulation and podocyte consumption, independent of structural-\nfunctional adaptations. In an adriamycin nephropathy model, male rats developed more glomerulosclerosis\n2023 Ozkurt et al. Cureus 15(8): e43058. DOI 10.7759/cureus.43058\n7\n of \n10\nthan female rats. Treatment of female rats with ovariectomy or exogenous testosterone administration\ncaused an increase in albuminuria and acceleration of mesangial sclerosis \n[22]\n. Androgen receptors were\nidentified in micro-dissected murine glomeruli and cultured mesangial cells. Exogenous testosterone\nadministration increased androgen receptor expression in addition to profibrotic cytokine TGF-1 mRNA\nlevels \n[23]\n. Additionally, in transgenic models, excessive expression of TGF-1 was shown to support FSGS by\nproviding strong proapoptotic stimulation of podocytes \n[24]\n.\nThough participants in our study appeared to have normal renal functions and albumin excretion rates in\nurine, AAS+DS users had significantly lower cystatin C-based GFR values than DS users and significantly\nhigher amounts of albumin excretion. These findings bring to mind a correlation between early renal injury\nlinked to direct AAS use and the need for more research on the topic.\nProtein supplementation causes an increase in renal perfusion and GFR as an appropriate adaptive response\nto the increase in nitrous waste, a product of protein metabolism. This situation is considered to accelerate\nchronic hyperfiltration and progression to glomerulosclerosis \n[25]\n. Recent data show that moderate protein\nsupplementation of 60 g/day for one month does not cause adverse effects on renal function in overweight\nand obese individuals with normal renal function. Recent data show moderate degrees of protein\nsupplementation, like 60 g/day for one-month duration, may cause unwanted effects on renal function in\noverweight and obese individuals with normal renal function \n[26]\n. Additionally, there is a need to research\nthe impact of higher doses and long-duration protein supplementation. However, the effect of higher-dose\nand long-term protein supplementation on kidney function needs to be investigated. In our study, while the\nrate of protein use was naturally higher in the DS group, the amount of protein consumed by both groups\nwas found to be similar since the daily protein intake was higher in the patients using protein in the ASS+DS\ngroup. The similar consumption amounts for protein in both groups lead to the conclusion that the\ndifferences in albuminuria and cystatin-based estimated GFR may be linked to AAS use.\nBodybuilders frequently use creatine, and this elevates plasma creatinine levels and may show eGFR as\nmistakenly low \n[27]\n. However, a new meta-analysis showed that creatine supplementation did not\nsignificantly change creatinine levels and emphasized the need for more homogeneous and high-quality\nstudies \n[28]\n. In our study, the creatine use rates were significantly high in the group using DS, and this\nsituation may have caused high measurement of serum creatinine levels in patients and low calculation of\nGFRCr values. This may explain the similar measurement of GFRCr values in both groups.\nHuman studies have not directly addressed the potential role of androgens in podocyte damage or\nhemodynamic factors as predisposing to the development of FSGS. Given the widespread use of AASs among\nathletes, it is likely that additional genetic and environmental factors are required to establish clinically\nsignificant kidney disease. Deshmukh N et al. reported that with chronic and /or excessive use of AAS,\nindividuals with a deletion polymorphism in the UGT2B17 gene (del/del) may be at increased risk of\ndeveloping kidney disorders due to the increase in BMI and possible direct toxic effects of steroids on the\nkidneys. They hypothesized that insufficient elimination of biologically active steroids would cause elevated\nserum levels and excessive increase in muscle mass, and that the increase in BMI could cause sustained high\nglomerular pressure and kidney injuries. They reported that further research on AAS metabolism in the\npresence of UGT2B17 gene deletion is required \n[29]\n. In athletes using AAS and other performance-\nenhancing drugs and supplements, proteinuria and mild kidney failure are generally asymptomatic, and\nkidney injury will probably be inadequately diagnosed if not regularly screened. The need for closer\nmonitoring of kidney functions should be considered in the presence of gene deletions that may cause\npossible slowing of AAS metabolism.\nAmong additional side effects associated with AAS, changes in blood lipid levels (increase in LDL and\nreduction in HDL) and a variety of hepatotoxic side effects are reported \n[30]\n. In our study, HDL level was low\namong AAS users with high liver enzyme levels.\nOur study is the first pilot study to use creatinine in conjunction with cystatin C to assess kidney functions\nin bodybuilders. The participants were carefully chosen, and patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus,\nor a single kidney (confirmed with renal ultrasound) that could cause hyperfiltration injury were not\nincluded in the study. Additionally, our study has some limitations. The first of these is the low number of\nparticipants, which was due to the closure of gyms linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and the refusal of\nsome bodybuilders to participate in the study, as they wanted to keep their drug use confidential. Another\nlimitation is that participants used AAS and diet supplements periodically according to competition or\nactive definition periods, whereas our study was conducted randomly, independent of these periods.\nHowever, we believe that our findings are still valuable in terms of assessing the renal impacts of long-term\ndrug use.\nConclusions\nCystatin-based GFR values were found to be significantly lower in AAS+DS users and significantly higher in\nurinary albumin and protein excretion than in DS users. Although these findings suggest a relationship\nbetween early kidney damage directly related to the use of AAS, the subject needs to be investigated further.\n2023 Ozkurt et al. Cureus 15(8): e43058.
