An increase in fat and protein in the diet with a \nmoderate reduction in carbohydrates was reported to reduce \npostprandial glucose and improved T2DM control [ 6].

This research sought to establish a relationship between the dietary levels of branched-chain amino acids \n(BCAA) and the risk of T2DM.\nMethods This case-control study was carried out on 4200 participants consisting of 589 people with T2DM and 3611 non-\ndiabetic aged 35 to 70 years residents in Sabzevar, Iran. Data on the economic-social, employment status, medical history, \nlifestyle, and sleep habits were collected via interview. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to check the nutri -\ntional status. Participants\u2019 dietary BCAA consumption was estimated using Nutritionist IV software.\nResults A significant negative association between the incidence of T2DM and the dietary levels of BCAAs after adjustment \nfor age and sex (OR = 0.972, CI 95%:0.648\u20130.996, P  = 0.022). The negative association remained significant after additional \nadjustments for body mass index (BMI) and physical activity (OR = 0.967, CI 95%: 0.943\u20130.992, P  = 0.010). Interestingly, \na positive association was found between T2DM and total BCAAs (OR = 1.067, CI 95%: 1.017\u20131.119, P  = 0.008), Isoleu -\ncine (OR = 1.248, CI 95%: 1.043\u20131.494, P  = 0.016), Leucine (OR = 1.165, CI 95%: 1.046\u20131.299, P  = 0.006) and Valine \n(OR = 1.274, CI 95%: 1.088\u20131.492, P  = 0.003) after further adjustment for calorie intake.\nConclusions Our results demonstrate branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) including isoleucine, leucine, and valine are \nnegatively associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) after adjusting for age and sex, BMI, and physical activ -\nity. However, adjusting for calorie intake reversed the association between T2DM and BCAAs. These findings suggest that \nthe association between BCAAs and T2DM may be influenced by calorie intake.

The \nBCAA \u2013 Isoleucine, Leucine, and Valine \u2013 have specific \nstructural features (non-linear aliphatic side chain) due to \nwhich they have identical catabolic pathways. BCAA are \nessential amino acids, which cannot be synthesized de novo, \nand dietary intake is the only source [ 20]. A typical diet con -\nsists of 15\u201325% BCAA [ 21] and the plasma BCAA levels \nincrease following consumption of a meal with BCAA, \nwhich is reported to be associated with an increased risk \nof T2DM [ 20]. Hence, the BCAA metabolism and plasma \nconcentration are reliable markers of insulin action and can \nbe used to predict the risk of developing obesity and T2DM \n[22].\nWhile the BCAA represent essential amino acids required \nfor cellular protein synthesis, there is conflicting evidence \navailable to support their role in the metabolic health \n[23\u201325]. For instance, a Leucine-rich diet was reportedly \nassociated with a lower incidence of obesity and metabolic \nsyndrome [ 26]. In the mice model, an increase in the dietary \nLeucine intake substantially decreased diet-induced obesity, \nhyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia [ 23] Although \nthe attempt to understand the role of BCAA in metabolic \nhealth dates back to 1976, their role in T2DM is still to be \nelucidated [ 24]. Therefore, this case-control study aimed to \ninvestigate the association of dietary intake of BCAA with \nthe risk of T2DM.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThis case-control study was carried on a total of 4200 par -\nticipants of the first phase of the Persian Sabzevar Cohort \nStudy(PSCS), consisted of 589 patients with T2DM and \n3611 non-diabetic people aged 35 to 70 years in Sabzevar, \nIran. For this study, T2DM was defined as fasting blood \nsugar equal to or higher than 126 mg/L. Inclusion cri -\nteria were age between 35 and 70 years, no more than 3 \nmonths have passed since the diagnosis of diabetes in the \ncases, and written consent to participate. Exclusion criteria \ninclude people with a family history of diabetes, undergoing \ntreatment with drugs affecting diabetes, and current use of \nbranched-chain amino acid supplements.\nData collection\nData on economic-social and employment status, lifestyle, \nand sleep habits were collected. Furthermore, drug history, \nmedical history, and hospitalization status in the last year \nwere collected during the interview. The level of physical activity was measured as the metabolic equivalent of task \n(MET). A MET is the ratio of the rate of energy expended \nduring an activity to the rate of energy expended at rest.\nTo measure weight and height, a mechanical column \nscale (SECA 755) and a mobile stadiometer (SECA 204) \nwere used, respectively. The BMI of the participants was \ncalculated using the following formula: body weight(kg)/\nheight(m)2 [1]. Furthermore, to check the nutritional and \nsupplement status, the data was obtained from the Persian \ncohort food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and its valid -\nity and reliability were confirmed. Then, the participant\u2019s \ndietary BCAA consumption was estimated using Nutrition -\nist IV software.\nAt the time of the examination, blood samples were taken \nfrom the antecubital vein for biochemical analysis after an \novernight fast of at least 10 h, and the serum was separated \nand maintained at a temperature of -700 C. Diabetes was \ndiagnosed at fasting blood sugar (FBS) of greater than or \nequal to 6.99 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), according to the Ameri -\ncan Diabetes Association 2020 criteria [ 25].\nStatistical analysis\nThe data on the variables measured were analyzed, and for \nthe quantitative variables, means were compared between \nthe two groups by an independent t-test or non-parametric \n(Mann-Whitney) test. For the qualitative variables, the two \ngroups were compared by Chi-square test. The association \nbetween T2DM and dietary intake of BCAA was assessed \nusing different models of logistic regression. All analyses \nwere performed using SPSS software and P  < 0.05 was con -\nsidered as the cut-off for the statistical probability.\nResults\nIn this study, the patient with T2DM was older (54.53 vs. \n48.36 years, P  < 0.001), and had lower height (161.44 vs. \n162.33 cm, P  = 0.033), higher weight (76.18 vs. 73.77 kg, \nP < 0.001), higher BMI (29.24 vs. 28.02 kg/m2, P  < 0.001), \nand lower MET (37.25 vs. 38.86 kcal/kg/day, P  < 0.001) \ncompared with the controls group (Table 1)(Fig. 1).\nRegarding dietary intake of participants, the amount of \nenergy (2381 vs. 2516 kcal, P  < 0.001), total fat (61.47 vs. \n64.99 g/day, P  = 0.003), carbohydrate (393.16 vs. 415.9 g/\nday, P  < 0.001), alcohol (0.025 vs. 0.035 g/day, P  = 0.001), \nisoleucine (2.99 vs. 3.08 mg/day, P  = 0.044) was signifi -\ncantly lower in cases than in controls. No difference was \nfound between the intake of total protein, Leucine, and \nValine in the two groups (Table 2).\nAs shown in Table 3, there was a significant nega -\ntive association between the incidence of T2DM and the \n1 3\nJournal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disordersdietary levels of BCAA after adjustment for age and sex \n(OR = 0.972, CI 95%:0.948\u20130.996, P  = 0.022) (Model 1). \nThe result remained significant after additional adjust -\nments for BMI and physical activity (OR = 0.967, CI 95%: \n0.943\u20130.992, P  = 0.010) (Model 2). Interestingly, a positive \nassociation was found between T2DM and BCAAs after \nfurther adjustment for the calorie intake (OR = 1.7, CI 95%: \n1.017\u20131.119, P  = 0.008).\nRegarding the association between T2DM and different \ntypes of BCAAs, there was a negative association between \nT2DM and Isoleucine (OR = 0.892, CI 95%: 0.810\u20130.981, \nP = 0.019), Leucine (OR = 0.938, CI 95%: 0.887\u20130.991, \nP = 0.023), Valine (OR = 0.909, CI 95%: 0.837\u20130.987, \nP = 0.022) after adjustment for age and sex (Model 1). Also, \nthere was a negative association between T2DM with Iso -\nleucine (OR = 0.876, CI 95%: 0.795\u20130.966, P  = 0.008) and \nLeucine (OR = 0.929, CI 95%: 0.878\u20130.983, P  = 0.011) and Valine (OR = 0.937, CI 95%: 1.088\u20131.492, P  = 0.094) \nafter additional adjustments for BMI and physical activ -\nity (Model 2). The result remained significantly positive \nbetween T2DM and Isoleucine (OR = 1.248, CI 95%: \n1.043\u20131.494, P  = 0.016) Leucine (OR = 1.165, CI 95%: \n1.046\u20131.299, P  = 0.006) and Valine (OR = 1.274, CI 95%: \n1.088\u20131.492, P  = 0.003) after further adjustments for dietary \ncalorie intake (Model 3).\nDiscussion\nThis case-control study for the first time, reports on the \nassociation between type 2 diabetes and dietary intake of \nBCAA.

Additionally, participants\u2019 \nfood consumption was substantially different between the \ncases and controls in terms of calories, total fat, carbohy -\ndrate, alcohol, and Isoleucine. Although there was no differ -\nence in the amounts of other dietary ingredients, including \ntotal protein, Leucine, or Valine between the two groups. \nThis study after calorie adjustment had similar results \nto previous studies that type 2 diabetes can be associated \nwith dietary intake of BCAA. A prospective cohort study \n[26] reported that intake of BCAA for the long-term could \nincrease the risk of incident T2DM. These associations \nwere independent of traditional risk factors of diabetes, like \nBMI. Another study showed that consumption of BCAA, \nPhenylalanine, and Tyrosine was associated with impaired \nfasting glucose and metabolic syndrome [ 27]. Results in a \nmeta-analysis showed that elevation in the levels of BCAA \ncould cause IR. In contrast, there is no association between \nelevated levels of Glutamine and Glycine and IR [ 28]. In \nfact, several studies, particularly in Caucasian and Asian \nethnic groups, showed that high BCAA levels are associ -\nated with the development of type 2 diabetes [ 29\u201335]. In the \nFramingham Offspring study, elevated plasma BCAA levels \nhad a positive correlation with fasting insulin levels that can \npredict the future risk of T2DM, especially in obese people \n[20]. Several studies also demonstrated an adverse associa -\ntion between BCAA and T2DM, because of BCAA\u2019s role \nin the development of IR [ 20, 36, 37]. In a Japanese study, \nBCAA was inversely associated with T2DM in women but \nwere not significantly associated with T2DM in men [ 38]. \nThese differences could be in terms of the population age \n(35 years vs. 50\u201379 years) and T2DM ascertainment by \nself-report compared with HbA1c [ 7, 38]. Although another \nstudy reported that increased dietary intake of BCAA was \nassociated with lower T2DM risk [ 38], ethnic differences \ncan be responsible for such contradictory results.\nThe BCAA contributes to the development of T2DM \nvia several mechanisms. BCAA can extend the secretion of \nglucagon and insulin secretion for a prolonged period [ 39]. \nAdditionally, BCAA can play a major role in the pathophys -\niology of IR by promoting the production of hexosamine \nand gluconeogenic precursors [ 38]. Another hypothesis \nrelates to the role of BCAA in activating the mechanistic \ntarget of the Rapamycin (mTORC) pathway. BCAA may \nactivate mTORC1, with a negative effect on insulin recep -\ntors and promoting IR [ 40]. Amino acids can inhibit glucose \ntransport and phosphorylation and impair glucose utiliza -\ntion and some studies showed that elevated levels of plasma \namino acid can cause IR in skeletal muscle and stimulated \nendogenous glucose production in healthy men [ 40, 41]. \nAnother mechanism is associated with changes in genes, \nespecially the Protein Phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ Dependent Table 3  The association between T2DM and the dietary BCAA\nBCAAs Isoleucine Leucine Valine\nOR CI 95% P OR CI 95% P OR CI 95% P OR CI 95% P\nModel 1 0.972 0.948\u20130.996 0.022 0.892 0.810\u20130.981 0.019 0.938 0.887\u20130.991 0.023 0.909 0.837\u20130.987 0.022\nModel 2 0.967 0.943\u20130.992 0.010 0.876 0.795\u20130.966 0.008 0.929 0.878\u20130.983 0.011 0.937 0.869\u20131.011 0.094\nModel 3 1.067 1.017\u20131.119 0.008 1.248 1.043\u20131.494 0.016 1.165 1.046\u20131.299 0.006 1.274 1.088\u20131.492 0.003\nModel 1: Adjusted for age and sex, Model 2: Additional adjustments for BMI and physical activity, Model 3: Further adjustments for dietary calorie intake\n1 3\nJournal of Diabetes & Metabolic DisordersDeclarations\nEthics approval and consent to participate  This study was approved \nby the Ethical Committee of the Research Ethics Committee of the \nSabzevar University of Medical Sciences, Sabzevar, Iran.

Using a validated FFQ to \nassess regular dietary intake to determine the consumption \nof dietary BCAA was an important strength. Thus, the cur -\nrent study has another important strength including a larger \nsample size. Even though clinical measurements, not self-\nreports, were used to determine T2DM status. The primary \ndrawback of the current investigation was the reliance on \nthe patient\u2019s recollection of the self-reported FFQ, which \nwas used to evaluate dietary consumption.\nConclusion\nIn this study, patients with T2DM were found to have lower \nlevels of BCAAs in their diet compared to the control group, \nand there was a negative association between T2DM and \nthe dietary levels of BCAAs. However, after adjustment for \ncalorie intake, a positive association was found between \nT2DM and BCAAs. Furthermore, there was a negative \nassociation between T2DM and individual BCAAs (Isoleu -\ncine, Leucine, and Valine), but this association became.\npositive after adjustment for dietary calorie intake. Fur -\nther studies need to investigate the mechanisms behind \nthese associations and whether BCAA supplementation \ncould potentially benefit patients with T2DM. It would also \nbe interesting to explore the role of other dietary factors in \nthe development and progression of T2DM.\nSupplementary Information  The online version contains \nsupplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-\n023-01247-9 .\nAcknowledgements  The research was financially supported by Sabze -\nvar University of Medical Sciences, Sabzevar, Iran.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions  SAT, EB, ZA, GKH, SHT, SR, FA, ZS, AA, \nZM and SD designed the study, involved in the data collection, analy -\nsis, and drafting of the manuscript.
