Vitamin D adequacy (VDA) ( \u226530 ng/\nml) is rarely achieved, despite a rise in the use of vitaminD supplements (VDS).[1] We designed the present studyto assess the effectiveness of a treatment strategy used inour practice. Methods: We reviewed the outcomes of a pa-\ntient tailored strategy in our Endocrine practice in Patras,Greece for 10 years. Patients with VDD enrolled in a two-step strategy using a loading dose (LD) for 2 months andhalf that dose for maintenance (MD) thereafter, usingcholecalciferol 25.000 IU amps. LD: subjects with 25-D<10 ng/ml: 3 amps weekly; 25-D 10-19.9 ng/ml: 2 amps\nweekly; 25-D 20-29.9: 1 amp weekly. We retested 25-D after2 months and yearly thereafter. We halved the dose when25-D reached >50 ng/ml and doubled it when 25-D dropped\n<30 ng/ml. We followed our subjects for up to 5 years.\nSubjects who did not take VDS, served as controls. We ex-cluded those who admitted to use <50% of the VDS pre-\nscribed. All subjects signed informed consent for releaseof their clinical data. Results: A total of n =3,871 subjects\nwere included, with a mean follow up of 1.95 years:n=1,554 cases and n =2,317 controls. In an intention-to-\ntreat analysis, 25-D rose from 20.3 \u00b16.5 at baseline, to\n41.0\u00b110.3 at 2 months (VDA 1461/1554, 94.0%), 39.5 \u00b1\n8.8 at 1 year (VDA 792/876, 90.4%), 39.0 \u00b18.5 at 2 years\n(n=596, VDA 530/596, 88.9%), 39.5 \u00b18.8 at 3 years (VDA\n375/417, 89.9%), 40.5 \u00b18.6 at 4 years (VDA 258/280,\n92.1%) and 39.4 \u00b18.0 ng/ml at 5 years (VDA 174/189,\n92.1%). Controls had a baseline 25-D of 19.7 \u00b16.1, at 2\nmonths 20.2 \u00b17.3 (VDA 209/2317, 9.0%), at 1 year 19.8 \u00b1\n5.9 (VDA 146/1643, 8.9%), at 2 years 19.2 \u00b17.0 (VDA 105/\n1107, 9.5%), at 3 years 20.0 \u00b16.5 (VDA 98/821, 11.9%), at\n4 years 19.9 \u00b16.3 (n =71/633, 11.2%) and at 5 years 20.2 \u00b16.1 ng/ml (VDA 50/401, 12.5%). All time point means were\nlower in the control group compared to the treatment\narm, p <0.001. Overall, 324/3912 (8.3%) time point meas-\nures were <30 ng/ml on treatment and no measurements\n>100 ng/ml were observed; 1 new case and 3 recurrent cases\nof kidney stones occurred in the treatment arm; 2 new casesand 7 recurrent cases occurred in the control group, p >0.05.\nConclusions Despite its simplicity, our treatment strat-\negy appears extremely effective in producing vitamin D ad-equacy, as seen in this large, real-world population ofpatients with vitamin D de \ufb01ciency. Our strategy is one of\nthe most effective one \u2019s ever reported in day-to-day clinical\npractice. Similar protocols should be implemented globally,if we are to solve this major health issue.
