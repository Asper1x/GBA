However, no study has explored the possible ameliorative effect of O3FA on BPF\u2011induced \nsexual dysfunction. Thus, the effect of BPF and/or O3FA on male sexual performance was investigated. \nMale Wistar rats were randomized into 6 groups, corn oil \u2011treated, O3FA low and high dose (100 and \n300 mg/kg), BPF\u2011treated, BPF + O3FA low and BPF + O3FA high dose. BPF significantly impaired male \nsexual competence, evidenced by a reduction in motivation to mate, prolonged mount, intromission \nand ejaculation latency, and post \u2011ejaculatory index. Furthermore, a reduction in mount, intromission, \nand ejaculation frequency were observed. Also, BPF caused a decrease in gonadotropin releasing \nhormone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, nitric oxide (NO) cyclic \nguanosine monophosphate (cGMP), 3beta\u2011hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2\u2011HSD), 17beta\u2011\nhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2\u2011HSD), dopamine, and acetylcholine esterase. Furthermore, it was \naccompanied by a significant increase in prolactin and estrogen and poor pregnancy outcomes. These \nobserved BPF\u2011led alterations were abolished by O3FA administration. This study showed that O3FA \nameliorates BPF\u2011induced sexual dysfunction by upregulating NO/cGMP signaling and steroidogenic \nenzymes activities.\nSexual dysfunction (SD) is an impairment in sexual behavior and sexual stimulation that occurs as a result of \nabnormal or absence of psychological or physiological response to sexual stimuli. The term sexual dysfunction \ncan be used as a general term for various symptoms including erectile dysfunction, loss of libido or desire, and \nfailure to achieve sexual  intercourse1. According to an epidemiological study reported by Chen et\u00a0al.1, about 52% \nof the studied population that are 40\u201370\u00a0years old men were suffering from different types of sexual dysfunction, \nwhich resulted from different biological and psychological factors. Out of the estimated 15% occurrence of sexual \ndisharmony in couples globally, about 50% were due to male factors, and this could be a result of the sensitivity \nof the male reproductive system to environmental pollutants.\nBisphenol analogs (BPs) such as bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol S (BPS) have been \nclassified as environmental pollutants or endocrine disruptors. These compounds are utilized extensively in the \nchemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries. It has been established that BPA, the bisphenol compound used \nthe most frequently, is involved in the emergence of numerous human diseases, including male sexual dysfunc-\ntion. Because of this, the use of BPA has been severely limited since  20102. Concurrently, the industry has begun \nmaking widespread use of BPF, which serves as a significant alternative to  BPA2. The presence of BPF in the envi-\nronment is beginning to emerge as its use continues to increase. BPF is found in several environmental media, \nincluding indoor dust and water, in addition to being found in food, feeding bottles, cosmetics, and medical \ndevices. In a review of numerous food items in the United States, BPF was shown to be the second most prevalent \nanalog present in beverages, dairy products, fats and oils, fish and shellfish, meat, cereals, fruits, and  vegetables3. \nOral route is the major route of exposure to BPF but other routes include dermal and inhalation. Despite the \ncontinuous usage of BPF, there is little information on its effect on male sexual performance. The role of NO/OPEN\n1Physiology Department, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria. 2Physiology Department, Federal \nUniversity of Health Sciences, Ila Orangun, Osun State, Nigeria. *email: adeyemiodetayo@gmail.com\n2\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |        (2023) 13:18060  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45344-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/cGMP signaling and steroidogenic enzymes in BPF-induced male sexual dysfunction is yet to be fully explored. \nAlso, whether omega 3 fatty acid (O3FA) will ameliorate BPF-induced male sexual dysfunction is not known.\nThe penis is one of the external organs of the male reproductive system. The penis performs two major sexual \nfunctions which are erection and ejaculation. Penile erection involves a cascade of reactions that commences \nwith the release of NO by the nerves and endothelial cells in the penis, and has been implicated in maintaining \nnormal blood flow and male sexual  performance4,5. A decline in the circulating NO has been linked with numer -\nous disease conditions such as sexual  dysfunction6. NO is synthesized from non-adrenergic/non-cholinergic \nparasympathetic nerves. It is released from both the cavernosal nerve ending and the endothelial cells of the \npenile artery upon stimulation from the spinal  cord7. Once NO has been released, it stimulates a cascade of \naction, which leads to the relaxation of the smooth muscle of corpora cavernosa to stimulate penile erection. \nNO stimulates penile erection by positively modulating guanylate cyclase, which leads to the synthesis of cyclic \nguanosine monophosphate (cGMP).\nTestosterone (T) is a major hormone responsible for male sexual  functions8, and it is produced by the testis \nvia the activities of steroidogenic enzymes. Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein (StAR) translocates choles-\nterol into the inner mitochondria membrane of the testicular tissue, where it is being converted to pregnenolone \nbefore being acted on by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD) to be converted to progesterone. The \nprogesterone is then converted to a series of metabolic substrates before finally being converted into testosterone \nby 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2-HSD). Studies have shown that the upregulation of these enzymes \nincreased the biosynthesis of testosterone. However, inhibition of these enzymes consequently leads to the sup-\npression of the circulating level of  testosterone9.\nOn the other hand, O3FA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that can only be ingested exogenously \nthrough dietary  supplement10. The three major O3FAs are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid \n(EPA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). These three are required for a variety of functions, including growth, \nreproduction, vision, and the development of the  brain11. While the data reporting the beneficial effect of O3FA \non male sexual performance is lacking, it has been shown to have vasodilatory effect in different vascular  beds12, \nand by extension, could cause vasodilation of smooth muscle of corpora cavernosa which can improve male \nsexual function via NO/cGMP signaling.\nFindings from our previous studies revealed that cessation from BPF exposure did not completely reverse \nthe observed BPF-induced sexual and testicular  dysfunction13,14. Hence, this study was designed in an attempt \nto completely ameliorate the observed BPF-induced sexual dysfunction. Despite the beneficial effect of O3FA \non male reproduction, no study has investigated its possible role on male sexual performance and pregnancy \noutcome. Hence, this study was designed to investigate the ameliorative effect of O3FA and its possible mecha-\nnisms of action on BPF-induced male sexual dysfunction.\nMethods and materials\nExperimental animals\nOne hundred and twenty Wistar rats (sixty males and sixty females) of similar weights were purchased from the \nBiochemistry Department, University of Ilorin. The animals were handled carefully based on the Guidelines for \nLaboratory Animal Care published by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and Animal Research: Reporting \nof In\u00a0Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines for reporting experimental findings were followed. The experi-\nmental protocol was under the guidelines of the National Research Council\u2019s for the Care and Use of Laboratory \nAnimals, and ethical approval was obtained from the University of Ilorin Ethical Review Committee (UERC) \n(UERC/ASN/2022/2396). The animals were randomly divided into cages free of dirt under natural conditions \nand were given free access to feed and water ad\u00a0libitum.\nExperimental design\nThe animals were allowed to acclimatize for 2\u00a0weeks and trained sexually as previously  documented15, after \nwhich they were divided randomly into six groups (n = 10 rats per group); 0.5\u00a0ml of corn oil was given to the \ncontrol group, while the animals in the positive control groups received 100\u00a0mg/kg (low dose) of O3FA (O3FA-\nL) and 300\u00a0mg/kg (high dose) of O3FA (O3FA-H), BPF treated rats were given 30\u00a0mg/kg of BPF. The rats that \nwere treated with BPF + O3FA treated rats got 30\u00a0mg/kg BPF + low dose of O3FA (BPF + O3FA-L) and 30\u00a0mg/\nkg of BPF  + a high dose of O3FA (BPF  + O3FA-H). The dosage of BPF used in this study is similar to previously \nreported doses  by13,16,17, while the dose of O3FA was earlier reported and used  by18.\nChemical preparation and administration\nO3FA was procured from Gujarat Liqui Pharmacaps Pvt. Ltd, India, and each O3FA capsule contains eicosapen-\ntaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the ratio of 3:2. BPF was procured from Sigma-Aldrich, \nSt. Louis, MO, USA (CAS: 620-92-8).\nThe dose of BPF was calculated based on the weight of each animal, dissolved in corn oil, and 0.5\u00a0ml of the \nsolution, containing the appropriate calculated dose, was administered for each rat. BPF and O3FA were admin-\nistered once daily via gavage for twenty-eight days. The oral route of administration was chosen to imitate the \nprominent human way of exposure. Over-night fasted animals were sacrificed 24\u00a0h after the last doses.\nTo evaluate sexual performance, the animals were made receptive by inducing estrous via the subcutaneous \nadministration of 10\u00a0g/100\u00a0g BW of estradiol benzoate and 0.5\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g BW of progesterone forty-eight and \nfour hours, respectively, prior to  copulation13,15,19. Estrous status was determined based on the vaginal smear and \nthe vaginal appearance at the time of examination. In other to confirm receptivity, female rats were introduced \nto male rats that were not a part of this research and were disengaged before  mating15.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |        (2023) 13:18060  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45344-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/Assessment of sexual performance\nOne male animal was placed per cage before introducing sexually receptive female rats (i.e., one male and one \nfemale rat per cage). Under dim light for 30\u00a0min, sexual performance was assessed and using a camcorder, sexual \nactivities were recorded. The activities recorded such as mount frequency (MF), mount latency (ML), motivation \nto mate, intromission latency (IL), intromission frequency (IF), ejaculation frequency (EF), post-ejaculatory \ninterval (PEI) and ejaculation latency (EL), were later viewed and scored based on the method  of15,19. Briefly, \nMotivation to mate was scored as previously  reported19:\n0: no sexual activity\n1: no interaction, rears and climbs on the chamber\n2: sniffs the female rat\n3: self- exploratory behavior such as grooming and sniffing of genitals\n4: grooms female counterpart anywhere\n5: rears and climbs sexually\n6: pursues and sniffs the female rat\n7: tries to mount but easily discouraged\n8: mounts with an integrated deliberate manner and not easily discouraged\n9: reflex and almost involuntary mount\nML: the time lag from when the female rat was introduced until the first mount when the rats achieved a \ncopulatory position. MF: the number of times the male rats attained copulatory position but could not achieve \nintromission (vagina penetration). Mount is achieved when the male rat lifts its forebody to climb the female rat \nfrom the back and grasps her flanks with the forepaw. IL is the time between the introduction of the female till \nthe first vagina penetration (intromission), while IF is the number of times the male rat attained intromission \n(vagina penetrations) but failed to ejaculate. Intromission is characterized by thrusting of the pelvic, followed \nby a rapid dismount. EL: is the time between the first intromission and ejaculation characterized by a deeper \npelvic thrusting and gradual dismount, followed by a period of reduced sexual activity. EF number of ejaculations \nfrom the time of the introduction of the female animal to the male within 30\u00a0min. Post ejaculatory interval (PEI) \nwas recorded as the time from the first ejaculation to the next copulatory behavior (mount or intromission).\nMeasurement of progeny parameters and fertility indices\nFertility index, Success of Fertility, Litter weight, rate of survival at weaning and size of litter were obtained as \ndescribed  previously15.\nFertility success was determined as the number of female rats that are pregnant divided by the number of \npaired rats multiplied by 100.\nFertility index: Number of rats that are pregnant divided by number of mated rats multiplied by 100.\nSize of litter: average amount of delivered progeny.\nWeight of litter: average size of delivered progeny.\nCollection of samples\nThe overnight-fasted rats were sacrificed 24\u00a0h after the last administration under the influence of 4\u00a0mg/kg of \nxylazine and 40\u00a0mg/kg of ketamine via the intraperitoneal  route15. Through cardiac puncture, blood samples \nwere collected into heparinized containers. At 3000\u00a0rpm, the samples of blood were centrifuged for 5\u00a0min to \nobtain plasma which was used for biochemical analysis. Testes and penis were harvested and homogenized in \ncold phosphate buffer solution for biochemical assays. Penile cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was esti-\nmated from the penile tissue while the testicular 3\u03b2-HSD and 17\u03b2-HSD were determined in the testicular tissue.\nBiochemical assays\nEstimation of hormones was carried out according to the instructions provided by the ELISA kit manufacturers. \nPlasma gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) was estimated as instructed by the manuturer (Melsin, China). \nLuteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, estradiol, and prolactin (PRL) were \nestimated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Bio-Inteco, UK). Acetylcholinesterase (AchE), cGMP \n(Elabscience, UK) and Dopamine (Adnova, US) were also assayed based on the instruction of the manufacturer \nusing ELISA kits. The method of Ridnour et\u00a0al.20 was used to estimate plasma nitric oxide (NO). Testicular \n13\u03b2-HSD and 17\u03b2-HSD were estimated according to the method of  Talalay21 and Jarabak et\u00a0al.22. Briefly, for \n3\u03b2-HSD, testicular tissue was homogenized, and the supernatant was carefully separated. 1\u00a0ml of the supernatant \nwas mixed with 1\u00a0ml of 100\u00a0\u03bcmol sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.9), 30\u00a0\u03bcg of dehydroepiandrosterone in \n40\u00a0\u03bcl of ethanol, and 960\u00a0\u03bcl of 25% BSA. The mixture was then incubated and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcmol of NAD was added. The \nabsorbance was read spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 340\u00a0nm using a blank as reference. For testicular \n17\u03b2-HSD, 1\u00a0ml of the supernatant obtained from the testicular sample was mixed with 1\u00a0ml of 440\u00a0\u03bcmol sodium \npyrophosphate buffer (pH 10.2), 40\u00a0\u03bcl of ethanol containing 0.3\u00a0\u03bcmol of testosterone, and 960\u00a0\u03bcl of 25% BSA. \nThe mixture was incubated and 1.1\u00a0\u03bcmol of NAD was added in a U 2,000 spectrophotometer cuvette at 340\u00a0nm \nagainst a blank. For circulatory NO, a mixture of 100\u00a0\u03bcl of Griess reagent, 300\u00a0\u03bcl of a nitrate-containing testicular \nhomogenate, and 2.6\u00a0ml of deionized water were incubated for 30\u00a0min at room temperature in a spectropho-\ntometer cuvette. A blank was prepared by mixing 100\u00a0\u03bcl of Griess reagent and 2.9\u00a0ml of deionized water. The \nabsorbance of the nitrate-containing sample was measured at 548\u00a0nm in relation to the reference sample.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |        (2023) 13:18060  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45344-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/Statistical analysis\nGraphPad PRISM 5 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA) was used in carrying out the sta -\ntistical analysis with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) and Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Data were reported as \nmean  \u00b1 standard deviation. Values of P  below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\nSexual performance parameters\nAs shown in Table\u00a0 1, BPF administration led to a significant reduction in motivation to mate (15.7%) when com-\npared with the control groups, and the observed decrease was blunted by both the low and high doses of O3FA. \nIn addition, treatment with low and high doses of O3FA prevented BPF-induced increased in ML, IL, and EL.\nFurthermore, BPF exposure led to a significant reduction in MF (41.7%), IF (32.9%), and EF (62%) compared \nwith the vehicle treated and O3FA treated control groups. Co-administration of BPF with O3FA significantly \nprevented BPF-induced reduction in MF, IF, and EF.\nHormonal changes\nAlthough BPF did not lead to a significant decrease in plasma GnRH compared with the control groups. However, \nBPF exposure brought about a significant reduction in plasma LH (p < 0.0001), FSH (p < 0.001), and testosterone \n(p < 0.0001). While the observed decreased following BPF exposure was abolished by co-administration of BPF \nwith both the low and high dose of O3FA, treatment with O3FA-H is more effective in ameliorating the BPF-\ninduced hormonal imbalance.\nAlso, BPF exposure significantly increased the level of plasma estrogen (p  < 0.0001) and prolactin (p  < 0.0001) \ncompared with the corn oil and O3FA treated control groups. Although the observed increase in plasma prolactin \nwas negated by the co-administration of BPF with both the low and high dose of O3FA, the observed ameliorat-\ning effect was more pronounced with the high dose of O3FA treatment (Table\u00a0 2).\nDopamine and AChE\nBPF significantly decreased circulating dopamine (p < 0.0001) and AChE (p < 0.0001) compared with the vehicle \nand O3FA control rats (Fig.\u00a0 1). Co-administration of BPF with O3FA led to a significant increase in dopamine \nTable 1.  Effect of O3FA on sexual performance parameters in BPF exposed rats.

Maintaining optimal male sexual function depends on coordinating the various body \nsystems, such as the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and reproductive  systems1,23. Once any of the systems \nmentioned above or the physiological components are disrupted, normal male sexual function quality will also \nbe affected. The male sexual function consists of the whole process of males\u2019 sexual activities, such as sexual \ndesire/libido, erection of the penile tissue, and sexual activities (vagina penetration and ejaculation)24, and any \nimpediment in any of these links is referred to as sexual dysfunction.\nSexual dysfunction is a complex physiological process that can be distorted by various pathological conditions \nsuch as endothelial dysfunction, hormonal imbalance, and neurological  disorders1. Numerous allopathic drugs \nhave been designed for treating sexual dysfunction, but these drugs are not without their side effects. Based on \nthis, researchers are intensifying their efforts to search for a natural supplement with fewer side effects that are \nreadily available and affordable. Hence, this study was designed to probe the impact of BPF on sexual dysfunc -\ntion and pregnancy outcomes by exploring the mechanism underlying male sexual function. Also, the possible \nameliorative effect of O3FA on male sexual dysfunction was investigated.

Furthermore, IF is an indication of erection efficiency and effectiveness of ejaculatory  reflexes25. Also, \nthe ML and IL are inversely related to sexual  arousal26, i.e., the higher the latencies, the lower the sexual arousal \nand vice versa. In addition, the PEI is an index of sexual vigour and determines the rate of reinstation from \ntiredness after an episode of sexual  activity27.\nIn this study, all the aspects of the studied sexual activities adversely affected by BPF exposure were ame-\nliorated by O3FA treatment. O3FA improved libido, sexual potency, and erection efficiency (evidenced by an \nincrease in MF and IF and a decrease in ML and IL) following BPF exposure. Furthermore, O3FA improved \nejaculatory reflex stimulation, an important indicator of sexual dysfunction, by decreasing BPF-induced pro -\nlonged  EL28.\nAlthough sexual performance parameters indicate erection efficiency, penile erection is influenced by NO/\ncGMP  signaling29, an endothelial function. NO is one of the major active secretions of the endothelial cells \nthat line the blood vessels. It is a nonadrenergic and noncholinergic neurotransmitter with vasodilatory func -\ntion. NO is produced from the penile smooth muscles, and it is activated once there is a sexual stimulus by the \ndopamine-oxytocin-NO  pathway30. NO enters the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum, where it acts \non the guanosine cyclase to produce cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The production of cGMP leads \nto vasodilation, which promotes penile erection. The observed downregulation of NO/cGMP signaling suggests \nthat BPF induces erectile dysfunction by disrupting the signaling pathway. Apart from the role of this pathway \non penile erection, NO has also been implicated in regulating hormonal secretions from the  testis1, which are \nresponsible for maintaining sexual functions; it is, however, tempting to conclude that the observed reduction \nin libido, sexual arousal, and erection efficiency following BPF exposure could be a result of hormonal imbal -\nance via a NO-dependent mechanism. In contrast, O3FA administration restored the observed downregulation \nof NO/cGMP signaling following BPF exposure. It is important to note that the discovery from this study that \nO3FA restored the disruption of NO/cGMP signaling is novel, suggesting its therapeutic effectiveness in treating \nerectile dysfunction.\nThe male sexual function requires both the peripheral and central nervous systems to be  intact31. Researchers \nhave established the roles of monoamine neurotransmitters on erectile functions using animal models, while \nhuman studies have also suggested their roles in sexual  desire32. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter, \nand it has been established to be required for motor activities that are important for sexual  performance33. Also, \ndopamine has been shown to trigger penile erection via its action on the oxytocinergic neurons that are present \nin the paraventricular nucleus (PCN) of the hypothalamus and also in the pro-erectile sacral parasympathetic \nnucleus of the spinal cord (SPC)34. Therefore, it is plausible to infer that the BPF-induced sexual dysfunction \ncould be due to, at least in part, BPF-induced decline in dopamine.\nAdditionally, the observed decrease in AChE could account for the BPF-induced sexual dysfunction. The \nfinding from this study that BPF decreased AChE is similar to previous studies that reported similar observations \nfollowing BPF  exposure35 and its  analog36,37. Although, it is expected that a decline in AChE should improve \nsexual function since AChE activities have been shown to breaks down or hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh), which \nis also responsible for penile  erection38. In addition, the presence of ACh also stimulates dopamine  release39\u201341. \nThis suggests that the presence of AChE could inhibit the release of dopamine via its inhibitory effect on ACh. \nHowever, the decline in AChE in this study is accompanied by a decline in dopamine, suggesting an independent \npathway. The observed dopamine could result from the observed BPF-induced hyperprolactinemia since the \ninverse relationship between dopamine and prolactin has been previously  established42. On the other hand, BPF-\ninduced decline in AChE activities could be a result of oxidative  stress37,43 since hydroxyl radicals are involved \nin AChE  inhibition44. The observed BPF-induced reduction in AChE will eventually leads to the accumulation \nof ACh which has also been shown to increase oxidative  damage45,46. Furthermore, increase in ACh also inhibit \nGnRH secretion which in turn leads to a decrease in libido by impairing the activities of the HPG  axis47. The \nresult from this study that O3FA blunted BPF-induced reduction in dopamine agrees with the study of Chalon \net\u00a0al.48 that supplementation of O3FA increased the level of dopamine and D2 receptor binding. It is also pos -\nsible that the ameliorative effect of O3FA on BPF-induced reduction in AChE activities is via its antioxidative \n properties49, since BPF-induced AChE inhibition has been linked with oxidative stress.\nThe endocrine system tightly regulates normal sexual function by forming a closed-loop feedback network. \nThe hypothalamus releases GnRH to stimulate the secretion of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland, which then \nacts on the gonads to produce testosterone and estrogen. Testosterone production can be impaired once there is \na disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary\u2013gonadal axis. Testosterone is essential for libido, and its deficiency \nhas been implicated in sexual  dysfunction1. The observed disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary\u2013gonadal axis \nfollowing BPF administration could explain the observed sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, the findings from \nthis study that O3FA ameliorates BPF-induced endocrine dysfunction agree with the study of Akhigbe et\u00a0al.10 \nthat reported a similar effect of O3FA on LH, FSH, and testosterone.\nIn addition, the observed hyperprolactinemia following BPF exposure contributes to the observed sexual \ndysfunction in this study. Prolactin has been shown to increase following  orgasm50, inhibiting the surge in sexual \nmotivation and arousal to create a post-orgasmic refractory period. Hyperprolactinemia has been implicated \n8\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |        (2023) 13:18060  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45344-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/in male sexual  dysfunction51, and the possible mechanism of action is still under debate. The observed increase \nin prolactin and decrease in testosterone following BPF exposure suggests that prolactin impaired male sexual \nfunction via a testosterone dependent mechanism. Decreased circulating testosterone has been linked with \nhyperprolactinemia, which inhibits LH  secretion52, leading to further decline in circulating testosterone. Also, \nhyperprolactinemia can impair testosterone 5\u03b1 reduction into  dihydrotestosterone53, which accounts for testos-\nterone function. Furthermore, BPF has also been established to have weak estrogenic  activities54. BPF exposure \nmight act as an estrogen agonist by binding with estrogen receptors to increase estrogenic activities. Previous \nstudies have linked estrogen with an increase in prolactin secretion by either upregulating prolactin receptor \ngene expression and prolactin-secreting cells or downregulating the expression of dopamine  receptors42,55. Fur -\nthermore, the observed decrease in prolactin following O3FA treatment of BPF-induced hyperprolactinemia \nagrees with Emsley et\u00a0al.56, that observed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) decreased the level of circulating \nprolactin in psychiatric patients.\nThe testis containing Leydig cells is the major male reproductive organ or gonad located in the scrotum. The \nmain function of Leydig cells is to produce testosterone via steroidogenesis. The key enzymes in testicular ster -\noidogenesis are the 3\u03b2 and 17\u03b2-HSD57, and disruption in their activities could lead to a decline in testosterone \nproduction. The observed ameliorative effect of O3FA on 3\u03b2 and 17\u03b2-HSD in BPF-induced distortion in these \nandrogenic enzymatic activities could be the reason for the observed O3FA-induced increase in testosterone \nfollowing BPF exposure.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this study suggests O3FA ameliorates BPF-induced sexual dysfunction by upregulating NO/cGMP \nsignaling and steroidogenic enzymatic activities.\nData availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author.\nReceived: 23 April 2023; Accepted: 18 October 2023\nReferences\n 1.
