There is growing concern regarding adverse health and development\noutcomes of excess iron provision in early life. Excess iron may directly damage developing organs\nthrough the formation of reactive oxygen species, alter systemic in\ufb02ammatory signaling, and/or\ndysregulate trace mineral metabolism. To better characterize the in vivo effects of excess iron on\ndevelopment, we utilized a pre-weanling rat pup model. Lewis rat litters were culled to eight pups\n(four males and four females) and randomly assigned to daily supplementation groups receiving\neither vehicle control (CON; 10% w/vsucrose solution) or ferrous sulfate (FS) iron at one of the\nfollowing doses: 10, 30, or 90 mg iron/kg body weight\u2014FS-10, FS-30, and FS-90, respectively\u2014from\npostnatal day (PD) 2 through 9. FS-90 litters, but not FS-30 or FS-10, failed to thrive compared to\nCON litters and had smaller brains on PD 10. Among the groups, FS-90 liver iron levels were highest,\nas were white blood cell counts. Compared to CON, circulating MCP-1 and liver zinc were increased\nin FS-90 pups, whereas liver copper was decreased. Growth defects due to excess FS provision in\npre-weanling rats may be related to liver injury, in\ufb02ammation, and altered trace mineral metabolism.\nKeywords: iron supplementation; iron toxicity; infants; rat model; trace mineral interactions; inflammation\n1. Introduction\nIron de\ufb01ciency (ID) is a common micronutrient de\ufb01ciency that underlies approxi-\nmately half of all anemia cases in infants, children, and adults worldwide [ 1\u20133]. Infants\nare particularly at risk for ID, which, in addition to causing anemia, can disrupt cognitive\ndevelopment and increase risk for infection [ 3\u20135]. The American Academy of Pediatrics\nrecommends supplemental iron for all infants to prevent ID [ 6]. Supplemental iron can\nalso be harmful if provided beyond physiological requirements [ 7\u201311]. A growing num-\nber of studies report adverse effects of iron provision in iron-replete infants [ 12\u201316], but\nthe mechanisms behind iron toxicity in early life are not well understood. Recently, the\n2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee proposed that improving the ef\ufb01cacy of\nsupplemental iron provision in infants necessitates that future research investigate the\nmechanisms underlying adverse health and development effects of iron [7,8,17\u201319].\nThe effects of excess iron on growth and neurodevelopment during early life remain\nunclear. Deleterious effects of iron provision on anthropomorphic measures of growth in\niron-replete infants have been observed; however, associated defects in nervous system\ndevelopment, including cognitive delay, have been observed independently of delayed\ngrowth [ 9,12,13,20\u201323]. Such inconsistences are likely underscored by variation in the form\nand/or dose of iron provided in the study and interactions with baseline iron status or\nbaseline nutritional status. Iron potentiates the formation of reactive oxygen species that\ndisrupt cellular events required for normal organ development. Furthermore, supplemental\niron can dysregulate cellular zinc and copper pools, exacerbating the deleterious outcomes\nassociated with iron alone [13,24\u201326].\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 3913. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14193913 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 3913 2 of 18\nFerrous sulfate (FS) is an inexpensive form of iron present in both iron drops\nand infant formulas [ 27]. Excess FS can have adverse effects on growth and cognitive\ndevelopment [12,14,28\u201330], but the relationship between FS dose and infant development\nis not well-established [ 31]. Using an iron supplementation model in pre-weanling rats,\nwe investigated health and development outcomes of daily FS supplementation at three\nconcentrations: 10, 30, and 90 mg iron/kg body weight (BW). FS supplementation at\n90 mg iron/kg BW reduced growth, increased in\ufb02ammation, and reduced brain size. Our\nresults indicate that excess FS disrupts postnatal growth and neurodevelopment, and\nthese outcomes may be related to liver iron loading, systemic in\ufb02ammation, and trace\nelement interactions.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Animal Experiments\nAnimal experiments were approved by the University of California Davis Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee. Adult male and female Lewis rats (Charles River\nLaboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were housed under standard conditions for the\nduration of the study: in clear polycarbonate hanging cages in a room with constant\ntemperature (22\u000eC), humidity (63%), and 12 h light/dark cycles. Animals were provided\nad libitum access to 18% protein rodent chow (200 mg Fe/kg diet; 2018, Teklad Diets,\nMadison, WI, USA). Nulliparous females\u20148\u201310 weeks old\u2014were used for generating\nexperimental litters. On postnatal day (PD) 2, litters were culled to sex-matched litters of\n8 pups to standardize milk-availability, cross-fostering from litters born within 24 h period,\nas necessary. Litters (n = 12) were randomly assigned supplementation groups\u2014the number\nof pups from each treatment group as well as the number of litters represented are indicated\nin the Methods and Results. Pups from multiple litters receiving the same treatment were\nassessed to account for litter effect. Groups were as follows: 10, 30, and 90 mg iron/kg\nbody weight ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (Cat#215422-250G, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,\nMO, USA), or vehicle control (CON; 10% w/vsucrose). The lowest dose ( 10 mg iron/kg )\nrepresented of daily iron intake by formula-fed infants [ 32]. The 30 and 90 mg doses\nrepresented excess iron provision; and were below toxicity levels reported in adult rats [ 33].\nOral iron was administered once daily PD 2\u20139, in the afternoon by hand-pipetting. Body\nweight (BW) was recorded on PD 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (study end; day of necropsy). Supplement\nvolume was calculated according to body weight and ranged from 8\u201360 \u0016L.\n2.2. Necropsy and Hematology\nOn PD 10, litters were separated from dams and fasted for 4\u20136 h. Pups were weighed and\neuthanized by decapitation under deep anesthesia ( 100 mg ketamine\u000210 mg xylazine/kg\nBW). Whole blood was collected into EDTA-treated tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC,\nUSA) and held at 4\u000eC until processed. Whole brains were removed, weighed, and promptly\ndissected into four regions: prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (ST), hippocampus (HP), and\ncerebellum (CE). All brains were dissected by the same researcher for consistency .\nComplete blood counts (CBC; n = 3\u20134/group, 2 litters/group) were performed by\nthe UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine Clinical Pathology Laboratory within 24 h of\nblood collection.\n2.3. Non-Heme Iron\nNon-heme iron concentrations (n = 14\u201318/group, 3 litters/group for each tissue) of\nliver, kidney, spleen, and the four brain regions were determined by bathophenanthroline\nmethod [34].\n2.4. Histopathology\nFreshly isolated livers (n = 6/group, 3 litters/group) were immersion-\ufb01xed in 4%\n(w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h at 4\u000eC, then washed in three changes of 1 \u0002PBS\nand stored in 70% ethanol at 4\u000eC. Fixed livers were embedded in paraf\ufb01n using standard\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 3913 3 of 18\nprotocols. The UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine Anatomic Pathology Laboratory\ncompleted sectioning and staining. Liver sections were stained with Perls\u2019 Prussian Blue\nwith nuclear fast red counterstain for iron detection, as well as Masson\u2019s Trichrome for\nevaluation of liver injury and in\ufb02ammation.\nMasson\u2019s Trichrome-stained liver slides were scored for injury and in\ufb02ammation in a\nblinded fashion using a non-alcoholic fatty liver scoring system for rodents [ 35]. A veteri-\nnary pathologist at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine Comparative Pathology\nLaboratory assessed and scored steatosis (micro- or macro-vesicular), in\ufb02ammation, \ufb01brosis,\nand necrosis. Scores for steatosis, \ufb01brosis, and necrosis were assigned as follows: 0, param-\neter absent; 1, <10% affected area; 2, 10\u201325% affected area; 3, 26\u201350% affected area; 4, >50%\naffected area. Distribution of steatosis, \ufb01brosis, and necrosis were classi\ufb01ed as random, cen-\ntrilobular, midzonal, periportal, or diffuse (all zones equally affected). In\ufb02ammation was\nscored according to number of in\ufb02ammatory foci/\ufb01eld as follows: 0 = parameter absent,\n1 = minimal, scattered, rare (<1 per 2 \u0002\ufb01eld), 2 = mild (<2 per 2 \u0002\ufb01eld), 3 = moderate\n(2\u20134 per 2\u0002\ufb01eld), and 4 = severe (>4 per 2 \u0002\ufb01eld). Presence or absence of degeneration,\nhypertrophy, and oval cell/biliary hyperplasia was recorded.\n2.5. Liver Gene Expression\nAt necropsy, tissues were collected into RNA later\u00ae(Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c \u2122,\nWaltham, MA, USA), incubated for 24 h at 4\u000eC, and then stored at \u000020\u000eC until RNA\nextraction. The TRIzol method (Invitrogen \u2122, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to extract RNA\nfrom liver tissue, as outlined by the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Reverse transcription of total\nRNA to cDNA was performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Cat#4374966,\nApplied Biosystems \u2122, Foster City, CA, USA), and stored in EB buffer at 4\u000eC. Real-time\nPCR reactions were performed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Cat#1725121,\nBio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time machine. Primers for qRT-\nPCR were: Actb forward, 30-GAAATCGTGCGTGACATTAAAGAG-50;Actb reverse, 30-\nGCGGCAGTGGCCATCTC-50[36];Hamp forward 30-GCTGCCTGTCTCCTGCTTCT-50;\nHamp reverse 30-CTGCAGAGCCGTAGTCTGTCTCGTC-50[37]. Data analysis of the qRT-\nPCR results was performed using the delta/delta CT (2\u0000DDCt) method, with Actb serving\nas the housekeeping gene (n = 13\u201318/group, 3 litters/group).\nFor RNA-seq analysis, RNA ( n= 3 males/group; 1 male from each litter) was puri\ufb01ed\nwith the RNA Clean & Concentrator \u2122kit with DNase (Zymo Research Corporation,\nIrvine, CA, USA) and submitted to the DNA Technologies and Expression Analysis Core\nLaboratory at the UC Davis Genome Center. RNA quality was assessed by LabChip\u00aeGX\nprior to library construction. The library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform\nfor 3\u2019-Tag-Seq gene expression pro\ufb01ling. Read count matrices were constructed using\nsalmon [ 38] and a reference Rattus norvegicus transcriptome (Ensembl genome assembly\nmRatBN7.2, release 106) [39].\n2.6. Serum Chemokine/Cytokine Array\nFresh whole blood was incubated in sterile tubes at room temperature for 30 min, and\nthen centrifuged at 300 rcf for 15 min to isolate serum. Sera were diluted 1:1 in 1\u0002PBS and\nshipped on dry ice to Eve Technologies Corporation (Calgary, AB, Canada). Array services\nwere used (Cat#RD27) for quantifying 27 total chemokines and cytokines ( n = 10/group ,\n3 litters/group): CCL11, EGF, CX3CL1, IFN \r,IL-1\u000b, IL-1 \f, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-\n12(p70), IL-13, IL-17A, IL-18, IP-10, CXCL1, TNF \u000b, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CCL2, Leptin, CXCL5,\nCCL3, CXCL2, CCL5, and VEGF.\n2.7. Zinc and Copper\nZinc and copper concentrations (n = 9\u201318/group, 3 litters/group for each tissue) were\ndetermined in liver, kidney, spleen, and brain regions\u2014PFC, ST, HP , and CE\u2014by atomic\nabsorption spectrometry using methods described previously [32].\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 3913 4 of 18\n2.8. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis and plotting were performed with GraphPad Prism (v9.3.1). The\nstudy was designed to consider the variation between litters, as well as within litters, while\ntesting for differences among groups. When testing for differences in weight gain among\ngroups, pup body weights were averaged by litter and litters were treated as biological\nreplicates. A two-way repeated measure ANOVA was applied to test for effects of time and\nsupplementation group on litter weight gain and post hoc Tukey\u2019s test detected differences\nbetween groups. Samples for all other outcomes besides weight gain were taken randomly\nfrom multiple litters in the same group to capture litter variation. The sample size of pups\nand number of litters represented in each of the outcomes are listed in the corresponding\nmethods above. All datasets were checked for normality using the Shapiro\u2013Wilks test.\nKruskal\u2013Wallis and Dunn\u2019s tests were used for \ufb01nding overall group effects and differences\nbetween groups, respectively, in non-parametric data. p< 0.05 determined signi\ufb01cance.\nFor analysis of RNA-seq data, read count matrices that had been constructed in\nsalmon [ 38] were imported into R [ 40] with Tximeta [ 41] for differential gene expression\nanalysis of liver tissue according to iron dose group using DESeq2 [ 42]. Comparisons of\nexpression between groups were adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) and p-values < 0.05\nwere considered signi\ufb01cant.\n3. Results\n3.1. Excess FS Disrupts Growth\nAverage pup BW increased over time in all groups but was negatively impacted by\nFS-90 supplementation (Figure 1A). The BW of pups in FS-10 and FS-30 groups mirrored\nCON. However, in the FS-90 group BW was approximately 10% lower than CON by PD 4\n(p< 0.05), and 17% lower by PD 10 ( p< 0.001). Additionally, FS-90 brains weighed 10% less\nthan CON and FS-10 brains at PD 10 (Figure 1B, p< 0.001).\nNutrients  2022, 14, 3913 4 of 19 \n \n 2.7.

Liver Iron Loading from FS Dosing\nTo identify tissues impacted by iron loading following excess iron supplementation\nin pre-weanling rats, non-heme iron levels were quanti\ufb01ed in liver, kidney, spleen, and\nfour brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (ST), hippocampus (HP),\nand cerebellum (CE). Liver iron concentration increased in response to FS ( p< 0.0001;\nFigure 2A). Relative to CON, liver iron increased approximately 800% in the FS-10 group,\n900% in the FS-30 group, and 1100% in the FS-90 group; however, there was no signi\ufb01cant\ndifference in liver iron concentration among FS supplemented groups. In spleen, iron levels\nwere reduced approximately 80% in the FS-10 group ( p< 0.01) but increased 220% in the\nFS-90 group ( p< 0.01). Iron levels in kidney and all four brain regions were unmodi\ufb01ed by\nsupplemental iron at any dose. Iron deposition was undetectable at 40x objective in CON\nliver sections stained for Perls\u2019 Prussian blue for iron (Figure 2D) but was apparent even\nat low magni\ufb01cation (10x objective) in FS-group livers. Hepatic iron concentration was\ninversely correlated to BW ( p= 0.0001; Figure 2B) but independent of brain weight ( p= 0.09 ;\nFigure 2C). These results suggest elevated liver iron stores are inversely associated with\ngrowth, including weight gain in pre-weanling rats.\nNutrients  2022, 14, 3913 6 of 19 \n \n  \nFigure 2.

Hepatic non-heme\niron was signi\ufb01cantly correlated to hepcidin expression (Figure 2E,F). Thus, hepcidin is\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 3913 6 of 18\ninducible in the liver of pre-weanling rats and is re\ufb02ective of iron loading, as observed in\nadult animals [43].\nWhen data was strati\ufb01ed by sex, the spleen, kidney, and PFC non-heme iron concen-\ntrations were signi\ufb01cantly increased by iron loading in males only (Figure S2A).

Iron concentration in CON tissues was similar between males and females\napart from kidney tissue, where mean values were greater in females than male CON.\nConsistent between males and females, iron loading was most evident in the FS-90 livers,\nwhere it reached over 1300 \u0016g iron/g tissue in FS-90 groups (Figure S2).

Discussion\nIron is essential for growth and metabolism but in excess can be toxic. Although\nbene\ufb01cial to many infants, supplemental iron provided to those who are iron-replete can\ndeleteriously affect growth and cognitive development [ 7,9]. Excess iron may interfere with\ngrowth through its accumulation in developing tissue and associated toxicity, including\nformation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, iron accumulation can disrupt the\nmetabolism and transport of other trace minerals that are essential for normal growth. To\ninvestigate mechanisms of growth disruption, pre-weanling Lewis rats were supplemented\nfrom postnatal day (PD) 2 to 10 with excess FS iron doses (10, 30, or 90 mg iron/kg BW)\nor vehicle control (CON), and growth, tissue iron loading, systemic in\ufb02ammation, and\ntrace mineral status outcomes were assessed. Compared to CON, FS-90 litters exhibited\nimpaired growth, an effect that was not observed in FS-10 or FS-30 litters. Liver iron\nloading was observed in all FS groups, where the highest levels were occurred in the FS-90\ngroup. Delayed weight gain and lower brain weights observed in the FS-90 group may\nhave been related to in\ufb02ammatory signaling and altered trace mineral metabolism. Finally,\nthe effect on brain weight observed in the FS-90 group did not correlated to liver or brain\niron levels\u2014suggesting that adverse long-term cognitive-behavioral effects of excess iron\nmay not be related to early brain iron accumulation, as previously suspected.\nStudies from our group and others show that intestinal iron absorption is elevated in\npre-weanling animals [ 29,37,49,50], likely increasing susceptibility to iron toxicity. The LD50\nfor ferrous sulfate in adult rats is estimated to be 780\u20131100 mg iron/kg BW [ 51,52], where\nreduced body weight was observed in surviving rats [ 52]. In comparison, few studies have\ninvestigated the growth response upon excess iron provision in pre-weanling animals. We\nreport that 90 mg iron/kg BW as FS is suf\ufb01cient to disrupt growth in pre-weanling Lewis rat\npups (Figure 1). Our \ufb01nding that 10 mg iron/kg BW does not deleteriously impact weight\ngain in pre-weanling rats is consistent with prior literature [ 32]. Similarly, our group did not\nobserve effects on weight gain with 30 or 150 ug per day as FS from PD 2\u201320\u2014which equates\nto 0.6\u20133.8 mg iron/kg BW or 3.0\u201319 mg iron/kg BW, respectively [ 49,53]. Consistent with\nour results, Schr\u00f6der et al. did not \ufb01nd weight gain effects when pre-weanling rats were\nprovided 30 mg iron/kg BW as ferrous succinate [ 54]. Likewise, body weight gain in piglets\nprovided 50 mg iron/kg BW daily was unaffected during the pre-weanling period [ 29]. In\nHolstein calves, weight gain was reduced for those formula containing 5000 mg iron/kg\nformula as FS (equating to approximately 500 mg iron/kg BW), but not with 2000, 1000,\n500, or 100 mg iron/kg formula (~200, 100, 50, or 10 mg iron/kg BW) [ 55]. In our study,\nbrain weight was reduced in the FS-90 group, but neither the FS-10 nor the FS-30 groups.\nWe previously demonstrated that in pre-weanling Sprague Dawley rats, supplementation\nwith FS-10 increased brain weight at PD 15 [ 32]. Together, these results suggest that growth\nand brain development outcomes upon iron supplementation depend on both dose and\nduration. Moreover, FS doses that disrupt normal growth in pre-weanling rat pups may be\nsubstantially lower than doses reported for adult rats. Additional studies are required to\nadequately de\ufb01ne growth and mortality cutoffs for FS at this developmental stage.\nIn our FS dosing experiment, the liver was the tissue most affected by iron supplemen-\ntation (Figure 2); staining for iron in liver sections revealed mixed iron loading, a type of\niron loading that is observed with excess oral or parental iron supplementation, as well as\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 3913 12 of 18\nlate stage genetic hemochromatosis where iron granules are visible in hepatocytes, Kupffer\ncells, and portal macrophages [ 56]. Spleen and kidney iron levels increased moderately\nin the FS-30 and FS-90 groups, while iron levels in the brain were mostly similar between\nall groups. Of the four brain regions assessed, iron was increased in the striatum of FS-10\ncompared to CON; however, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum iron content were unaf-\nfected regardless of iron dose. With consideration to the reduced brain weight in the FS-90\ngroup, it remains plausible that excess FS disrupts brain development without changing\niron levels in major regions of the brain. Homeostatic mechanisms prevents iron loading in\nmost extrahepatic tissues [ 43]. Hepatocytes store excess body iron and produce hepcidin,\na hormone that protects against iron overload via suppressing intestinal iron absorption\nand reducing circulating iron release from the reticuloendothelial system [ 43]. Results\npresented here and previous radioisotope tracing experiments [ 49] provide evidence that\nhepatocyte iron regulation is intact in pre-weanling animals, where the liver accumulates\nexcess dietary (absorbed) iron. Impaired growth observed in the FS-90 group may re\ufb02ect\naltered liver function due to overt iron loading. However, histopathological evaluation of\nlivers for in\ufb02ammation, steatosis, \ufb01brosis, and necrosis did not reveal pathological changes\nin liver tissue. Although we did not detect gross abnormalities in liver morphology, cellular\nand molecular changes, including alterations in genes involved in \ufb01brotic possibilities are\nsuggestive of alterations in tissue function due to excess iron. Future studies could seek\nto establish iron status cutoffs that predict the risk for injury in the liver and extrahepatic\ntissues, including the gastrointestinal tract where iron absorption occurs.\nObserved hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in CON animals were similar to other\nvalues reported at this age [ 57,58] and were not affected by excess iron at PD 10, in con-\ntrast to previous studies from our group [ 32,53,59]. The FS-30 group had higher MCH\nvalues than FS-10, but no signi\ufb01cant effects were observed for any other RBC param-\neters ( Table 1). [32] . Among the previous studies from our group that found increased\nhemoglobin with iron, only one measured hemoglobin at PD 10, whereas others assessed\nPD 15 and PD 21 [ 32,53,59]. Dubuque et al. observed no effect on hemoglobin, RBC, or MCV\nwith iron at PD 12 [ 58]. RBC maturation and concentration increases with postnatal age [ 57],\nand thus effects of iron supplementation may be dynamic during the pre-weanling period.\nPigs are at higher risk of anemia compared to other animal models and require iron injec-\ntions for optimal growth during the pre-weanling period. Iron supplementation in piglets\nconsistently increases hemoglobin and hematocrit in controlled experiments [29,60\u201362] .\nConversely, studies involving iron supplementation of calves and foals have more mixed\nhematology results [ 55,63,64]. Variations in study design, including model species, iron\ndose, duration, and chemical form of supplement likely contribute to variability in iron\nassessment. Future studies should address whether exogenous iron provided in excess\naugments hematopoiesis in pre-weanling animals. In addition to established hematological\nparameters, assessing plasma iron and transferrin saturation levels in future studies would\nhelp clarify the availability of iron for RBC precursors.\nElevated WBC and neutrophil counts in the FS-90 group indicated a systemic in\ufb02am-\nmatory response upon excess iron exposure. Elevated serum CCL2, a pro-in\ufb02ammatory\ncytokine, was observed in the FS-90 group and CCL2 has been shown to promote steatosis\nduring liver injury [ 65]. Additionally, CXCL5 was reduced in FS-90 sera compared to CON.\nLower levels of CXCL5 were observed in humans with chronic liver disease, and was\nassociated with more severe necroin\ufb02ammation and \ufb01brosis [ 66]. Experiments in knockout\nmice have shown that Cxcl5 enhances neutrophil recruitment toward injured lung tissue\nby blocking pro-in\ufb02ammatory chemokine scavenging from circulation [ 67]. Lower serum\nCX3CL1 was observed in both the FS-30 group and FS-90 group. CX3CL1 is upregulated in\nhepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells due to liver injury and becomes elevated in serum [ 68].\nWe did not measure hepatic CX3CL1 expression in the present study, and therefore cannot\ndirectly link our observations of lower serum concentrations with liver injury. To the best of\nour knowledge, no prior studies have reported serum chemokine and cytokine expression\nfollowing excess iron at this developmental stage.\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 3913 13 of 18\nImpairments in growth due to excess iron supplementation may be underscored\nby trace mineral interactions. Providing excess iron to infants may compromise their\nabsorption and metabolism of other essential trace minerals [ 13,25,69,70]. As reported\nhere (Figure 4), differential effects of excess iron on hepatic zinc and copper levels have\nbeen previously observed [ 49]. Liver zinc was elevated in all FS groups, with the highest\nlevels observed in the FS-90 group. In contrast, liver copper levels were reduced only\nin the FS-90 group. In our prior study using pre-weanling Sprague Dawley rats, liver\nzinc was also elevated at PD 10 following daily supplementation with 30 or 150 \u0016g iron\nper day FS, equating to 0.6\u20133.8 mg iron/kg BW or 3.0\u201319 mg iron/kg BW, respectively.\nCopper levels were reduced in the treatment group receiving the highest dose (3.0\u201319 mg\niron/kg BW), while spleen and brain zinc and copper levels were unaffected [ 49]. Likewise,\nothers have found lower serum and tissue copper levels as well as reduced weight gain\nin weanling rats fed very high levels of iron (9000 mg iron/kg diet as iron carbonyl) from\nPD 21\u201335; assuming 7\u20138 g food intake and 50\u2013150 g BW [ 71], this equates to daily iron\nintake, approximately 500\u20131000 mg iron/kg BW daily intake [ 72]. Liver copper levels and\nweight gain were also reduced in weanling mice that consumed excess iron, attributed to\nimpairments in copper utilization as opposed to absorption [ 73]. Moreover, others have\nobserved elevated liver zinc and manganese in the absence of changes in liver copper [ 74].\nAltered hepatic zinc and copper metabolism and storage may be the cause or result of local\nor systemic in\ufb02ammatory signaling processes\u2014potentiated by tissue iron loading [75,76].\nIron loading induces the expression of metallothionein (MT), a cellular zinc-binding\nprotein that can also bind copper [ 77,78]. Speci\ufb01cally, iron upregulates Zip8 and Zip14,\nwhich preferentially transport zinc and iron at physiological pH [ 78]. Elevated hepatic\nzinc may re\ufb02ect increased zinc import and binding by MT as a secondary consequence\nof tissue iron loading, a phenomenon that would be further exacerbated by iron toxicity-\ninduced in\ufb02ammatory signaling\u2014compromising the availability of zinc for other growing\ntissues [ 77]. Likewise, lower levels of liver copper observed with increasing iron doses are\nlikely a consequence of iron decreasing the uptake of copper by the liver, and interfere with\nits cellular roles, including mediation of reactive oxygen species as an enzyme cofactor [ 79].\nIn summary, impaired growth due to excess iron feeding may, to some degree, re\ufb02ect\ndisrupted zinc and/or copper metabolism.\nPrevious studies suggest that the effects of iron supplementation on postnatal de-\nvelopment depend on sex [ 80,81]. Body weight and brain weight at the end of the study\nwere negatively affected in FS-90 males but not in females. Spleen and kidney iron levels\nwere also elevated in FS-90 males but not females. Liver zinc was elevated for FS males\nbut not females; however, liver copper was reduced for both sexes in the FS-90 group.\nThese results suggest male pups are more vulnerable to the deleterious effects of excess\niron supplementation; however, the speci\ufb01c mechanism underlying these effects is unclear.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no other study has tested the effect of sex on health risks\nof excess iron provision during a correlative developmental period. One possibility is\nthat accelerated growth due to testosterone suppresses hepcidin and permits greater iron\nabsorption, thereby heightening susceptibility to iron toxicity [ 82,83]. Direct measurements\nof testosterone are required to con\ufb01rm the timing of mini-puberty in pre-weanling rats,\nand explore the possible interaction with hepcidin in early life. In adults, differences in\niron requirements between sexes are largely due to the blood loss of menstruation, where\nmales tend to have higher liver iron stores and hepcidin expression than females [ 81].\nDuring infancy, a \u201cmini-puberty\u201d takes place: the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)\nis activated leading to a surge of testosterone in male infants [ 84]. Testosterone has been\nshown to inhibit hepcidin transcription and stimulate iron absorption, which in the context\nof the current study may increase the risk of excess iron exposure [ 85]. In line with this\nhypothesis, growth acceleration during infancy has been linked to greater demand for iron\nand decreased hepcidin expression [86].\nRNA-seq analysis of FS-supplemented livers identi\ufb01ed genes that were powerfully\nupregulated in all FS group livers (Figure 5). Surprisingly, we did not observe changes in\nNutrients 2022 ,14, 3913 14 of 18\nexpression of MT nor ZIP genes; and, although there Hamp and Tfrc\u2014genes involved iron\nregulation\u2014were altered, the other transcripts were more strongly induced in FS livers.\nAdditionally, Tfrc was downregulated only in FS-10 livers but not FS-30 or FS-90 livers,\nwhich was unexpected considering non-heme iron was elevated in all FS livers. Itgb5 ,\nwhich was up-regulated by over 1000-fold in all FS groups, encodes integrin beta 5, a\nprotein involved liver \ufb01brosis [ 87].Itgb5 was most strongly up-regulated in FS-10 and FS-30\nlivers (~1,000,000-fold CON expression). Although not observed histologically (i.e., \ufb01brosis)\nby PD 10, up-regulation of Itgb5 in livers of FS supplemented animals is suggestive of\ncellular dysregulation. Rattus norvegicus encode two Itgb5 transcripts. Our results suggest\ndifferential regulation of Itgb5 transcript variants in developing liver tissue in response to\nexcess iron [ 39,88]. Forkhead box protein N3 ( Foxn3 ), which is involved in regulation of\nhepatic glucose levels, was strongly induced in all FS groups but less-so in FS-90 livers.\nOverexpression of Foxn3 is associated with elevated blood glucose and up-regulation of\ngluconeogenesis [ 89,90]. This suggests FS increased the activation of liver genes involved\nin increasing energy availability. Future studies might uncover important relationships\nbetween iron toxicity and growth by investigating energy metabolism in response to excess\npostnatal iron exposure.\nThe current study has several strengths, including supplementation design, dos-\ning, and number of pups/litters assessed. Our \ufb01ndings support previous hypotheses\nthat excess iron disrupts growth and trace mineral metabolism in pre-weanling animals\nand provide new data on brain iron and trace mineral loading effects, hematology, and\nchemokine/cytokine expression in response to iron provision. Excess daily iron supple-\nmentation at 90 mg iron/kg BW as FS disrupts weight gain in pre-weanling rats. Reduced\ngrowth was related to excess iron loading, but reduced brain weight was independent of\nbrain iron levels. Iron loading in the liver following excess FS may induce tissue damage\nand in\ufb02ammation as well as disrupt zinc and copper metabolism. Together, our results\nsuggest liver damage, in\ufb02ammation, and trace mineral interactions may be involved in the\nimpaired growth outcomes of excess iron in pre-weanling rats.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://\nwww.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nu14193913/s1, Figure S1: Growth and development are disrupted\nonly in male pups.
