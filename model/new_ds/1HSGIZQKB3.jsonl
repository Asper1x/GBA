The administration of a STING inhibitor (ISD017) into the young 129.B6. Fcgr2b \u2011deficient \nmice prevents lupus nephritis development. This study mainly aimed to evaluate the effects of STING \ninhibition (ISD107) on established SLE in mice to prove that ISD017 could be a good therapeutic drug \nto reverse the already set \u2011up autoimmunity and kidney impairment. Twenty\u2011four \u2011week \u2011old Fcgr2b \u2011\ndeficient mice were treated with cyclophosphamide (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, once per week), \nISD017 (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, three times per week), or control vehicle for 8 weeks, and were \nanalyzed for phenotypes. Both ISD017 and cyclophosphamide treatment increased long\u2011term survival \nand reduced the severity of glomerulonephritis in Fcgr2b\u2011deficient mice. While cyclophosphamide \nreduced activated B cells  (B220+GL\u20117+), ISD017 decreased activated T cells  (CD4+CD69+) and \nneutrophils  (Ly6c+Ly6g+) in Fcgr2b\u2011deficient mice. In addition, ISD017 reduced IL \u20111\u03b2 and interferon\u2011\ninducible genes. In summary, ISD017 treatment in symptomatic 129.B6. Fcgr2b\u2011deficient mice reduced \nthe severity of glomerulonephritis and increased long\u2011term survival. ISD017 worked comparably \nto cyclophosphamide for treating lupus nephritis in 129.B6. Fcgr2b\u2011deficient mice. ISD017 reduced \nactivated T cells and neutrophils, while cyclophosphamide targeted activated B cells. These results \nsuggested that STING inhibitors can potentially be a new therapeutic drug for treating lupus.\nKeywords  Lupus nephritis, Sting, SLE, Sting inhibitor, ISD017\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease mediated by genetic susceptibility triggered \nby persistent immune activation leading to the loss of self-tolerance and the production of antibodies against \nnuclear  antigens1. The increased type I interferon (IFN-type I) activity or abnormal signaling has been identified \nas an essential pathogenic mechanism in  SLE2. The binding of these autoantibodies to nuclear antigens forms \nimmune complexes and subsequently induces type I IFN production. The capture of immune complexes by \nplasmacytoid dendritic cells enhances type I IFN production and the development of autoreactive B  cells3. With \nthe help of T follicular helper T cells, the autoreactive B cells increase autoantibody  production4. The circulating \nimmune complexes can accumulate throughout the organs, leading to complement activation, inflammation, \nand damage. The intricate link between the immune complexes and type I interferon signaling highlights the \nDNA sensing mechanisms, such as those mediated by the STING pathway, and the autoimmune responses \nobserved in SLE.\nThe presence of autoantibodies in SLE indicates a defect in B cell tolerance. The autoreactive B cells could \ndifferentiate and receive help from T follicular cells in the germinal center (T cell-dependent) and become long-\nlived plasma cells. In addition, without T cell help, autoreactive B cells can differentiate into short-lived plasma \ncells outside the germinal center (T cell-independent)5.OPEN\n1Center of Excellence in Systems Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, \nThailand. 2Medical Sciences Program, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, \nThailand. 3Graduated Program in Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Salaya, \nThailand. 4Center of Excellence in Translational Research in Inflammation and Immunology (CETRII), Department \nof Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. 5Department of Microbiology, \nFaculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. 6Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, \nAarhus, Denmark. 7Epithelial Systems Biology Laboratory, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National \nInstitutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. 8Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology, Department of \nMedicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. *email: Trairak@\ngmail.com ; Prapaporn.pis@mahidol.ac.th\n2\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |        (2024) 14:11020  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-61597-z\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/The etiology of SLE involves both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic polymorphisms influence the \nclinical response to SLE  treatment6. Patients with high interferon signatures respond well to treatment with \nanifrolumab (anti-interferon type 1 receptor)7,8. In addition, anti-BAFF antibodies show significant efficacy in \ntreating  SLE8. These data suggest that the heterogeneous nature of SLE requires various targeted treatments. The \nmechanisms of targeted therapy need to be explored to determine how the drug benefits SLE patients.\nDeficiency of Fc gamma receptor IIb ( Fcgr2b ), the sole inhibitory receptor in the FcGR family, is one of the \ngenetic factors implicated in lupus  disease9,10. Fcgr2b-deficient mice have shown elevated type I IFN signaling, \nleading to increased autoantibody production and SLE-like symptoms in mice by 6\u20138\u00a0months in the 129/Sv B6 \nbackground but not in the BALB/C  background9,11. The Fcgr2b gene is located on chromosome 1, which contains \nseveral lupus susceptibility genes in humans and  mice12,13. The backcrossed of the original 129. Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice \nand C57BL/6 mice were created to study the effect of linked genes on autoimmune  development14. The C57BL/6. \nFcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 129. SlamfB6 congenic mice and C57BL/6. Slamf129 mice developed mild disease symptoms compared to \nthe original 129 mice. Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212  mice15. The interaction of Fcgr2b and 129 strain-derived SLAM family proteins \nenhanced autoimmunity and spontaneous germinal  centers14,15, while Fcgr2b-deficient mice generated using \nB6 ES cells did not develop overt lupus  phenotypes16. The interaction between multiple genetic loci in 129 \nbackgrounds suggested the similar complexity of lupus susceptibility to human SLE.\nMultiple genes in the linked locus of Fcgr2b  contribute to SLE susceptibility. The Nba2 intervals, including \nFcgr, SLAM, and interferon-inducible genes, enhance autoantibody production and renal  disease17. The IFN-\ndependent phenotype of the Fcgr2b-deficient mice in this study could be related to the linkage region. These \nfindings suggested the importance of multiple genetic loci in chromosome 1 of the 129/Sv background, with the \nFcgr2b region involved in lupus  development12.\nSeveral roles of FCGR2B in human SLE have been studied. The meta-analysis of FCGR2B polymorphisms \nshows the association between FCGR2B (rs1050501) and SLE susceptibility under the recessive genotypic \nmodel of the C allele in the overall  population18, and low copy numbers of FCGR2B are associated with SLE \n susceptibility19. The polymorphisms of FCGR2B-T232 in the transmembrane domain reduce the lateral mobility \nand inhibitory function of  FCGR2B20. In addition, polymorphisms in the FCGR2B-FCRLA  locus are associated \nwith non-responders to intravenous cyclophosphamide treatment for lupus  nephritis21. Thus, the Fcgr2b -deficient \nlupus mouse is a relevant model for studying human SLE pathogenesis.\nStimulator of interferon genes (STING) is induced by cGAS when it recognizes dsDNA, increasing type I \nIFN production and showing an emerging role in lupus  pathogenesis22. A gain-of-function STING mutation in \nhumans causes SAVI (STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy), a disease of  interferonopathy23. \nSting  deficiency partially rescues perinatal lethality and reduces inflammation in Rnaseh2 knock-in mice, \nshowing increased interferon-stimulated gene  expression24. In addition, Trex1-deficient mice with autoimmune \nphenotypes and myocarditis survived without  Sting25,26. These data suggested that STING signaling contributed \nto non-lupus autoimmune mouse models.\nTLR-mediated mechanisms play roles in the MRL. Faslpr lupus-prone  mice27, While the MRL. Faslpr mice \ndevelop fatal glomerulonephritis, plasmacytoid DC activation, activated T- and B- cells, and anti-dsDNA \nproduction without Tlr928; the absence of Tlr7  reduces the production of autoantibodies to RNA antigens, \nT- and B-cell activation, and pDC  activation28. These data suggested differential roles of Toll-like receptors in \nlupus-liked phenotypes of the MRL. Faslpr mice. However, Sting  deficiency in MRL. Faslpr lupus-prone mice have \naccelerated the severity of  lupus29.\nUnlike the MRL. Faslpr lupus-prone mice, the Fcgr2b-deficient mice show a reduction of anti-dsDNA \nautoantibodies when Tlr9 is  absent30. At the same time, the overexpression of Tlr7 contributes to lupus phenotype \nin Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration) carrying  mice31,32, Tlr7 deficiency in Fcgr2b -deficient Yaa mice \nreduces plasma cell expansion and T cell  activation33. Furthermore, STING-mediated signaling initiates lupus \ndevelopment in Fcgr2b-deficient lupus mice by expanding dendritic  cells11. The role of STING in the lupus mouse \nmodel may differ in the context of pathway-mediated type I IFN signaling.\nTherefore, studies utilizing animal models of lupus are essential for further understanding the pathogenesis \nof SLE, leading to the development of effective treatments for patients. Previous studies have utilized a newly \ndeveloped STING inhibitor molecule (ISD017) in lupus mouse models lacking the Fcgr2b gene. Administering \nISD017 before the onset of anti-nuclear antibodies and lupus symptoms effectively reduced glomerulonephritis \nand autoantibody production in Fcgr2b-deficient  mice34. These findings support the potential application of \nISD017 in the treatment of SLE. Administering the drug to high-risk individuals before SLE symptoms may \nnot be practical in a clinical setting. However, to apply ISD017 effectively in treating SLE, studies investigating \nits efficacy in lupus mouse models that already exhibit symptoms or signs of the disease will provide proof of \nconcept for using ISD017 in real-life clinical settings.\nTherefore, this study mainly aimed to evaluate the effects of STING inhibition (ISD107) on established SLE in \nmice that showed autoantibodies and proteinuria to prove that ISD017 could be a therapeutic drug for the already \nset-up autoimmunity and kidney impairment. The researcher will use lupus laboratory animal models, specifically \n6- to 8-month-old Fcgr2b-deficient lupus mice presenting high levels of autoantibodies and proteinuria. The \nefficacy and underlying mechanisms of ISD017 will be compared to the standard immunosuppressive treatment, \ncyclophosphamide, commonly used for treating lupus nephritis (LN) in SLE.\nMethods\nAnimal model and experiment\nFcgr2b-deficient mice on the 129/C57BL/6 background (MGI Cat# 2448997, RRID: MGI:2448997) were obtained \nfrom Dr. Bolland (NIH, Maryland, USA). The Fcgr2b deletion was constructed on a 129\u00a0Sv/B6 hybrid background \nand backcrossed to C57BL/6 for 12  generations35. The 129.B6. Fcgr2b-deficient mice were bred together to \n3\nVol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |        (2024) 14:11020  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-61597-z\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/maintain the original 129. Fcgr2b-deficient mice. The littermates of 129.B6. Fcgr2b-deficient mice, both male and \nfemale mice, were followed up to the age of 6\u00a0months and screened for anti-dsDNA to confirm the development of \nthe lupus phenotype before randomly enrolling into three groups. The three treatments were cyclophosphamide \n(CYC) (25\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneal, once per week)36, ISD-017 (10\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneal, three times per week)34, \nor control vehicle (PBS), and the treatment period lasted for 8\u00a0weeks. We assessed the anti-double-stranded DNA \n(anti-dsDNA) in all groups of mice before initiating treatment and after treatment for 8\u00a0weeks. The survival of the \nmice was observed during the treatment period. The number of laboratory mouse cohorts at the initial treatment \nof the ISD-017, CYC, and PBS groups was 15, 9, and 20 mice, respectively. Mice were monitored throughout \ntreatment, and those that expired prematurely were excluded from analysis. After 8\u00a0weeks of treatment, the \nsurviving mice were humanely euthanized, and blood, kidney, spleen, and urine were collected for further \nanalysis. Mice were bred and housed at the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. All experiments were \nperformed with the approval of the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Chulalongkorn University \nMedical School with all relevant institutional guidelines (research no. 003/2563). All methods were performed \nfollowing the ARRIVE guidelines.\nISD017 (STING antagonist)\nISD 017 was derived from the conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP) that antagonizes type I interferon \nproduction induced by membrane fusion or influenza A  virus37. ISD017 is specific to cGAS and impacts dsDNA \nsensing without impacting other nucleic  acids34. In addition, ISD017 inhibited dsDNA activation of both type \nI IFN and TNF  production34. To dissolve ISD017, a panel of solvents was tested, namely,  H2O, 0.9% NaCl, TBS \n(pH 7.3), PBS (pH 7.4), HEPES, and PBS (pH 7.4) + 1\u00a0M NaOH. For the latter, which was most successful, 194\u00a0\u00b5L \nof PBS mixed with 6\u00a0\u00b5L of 1\u00a0M NaOH was added to 1\u00a0mg of ISD017.\nDetection of anti\u2011nuclear antibodies (ANA)\nThe sera (1:400) of Fcgr2b -deficient mice were diluted at 8\u00a0months, and wild-type mice were tested for ANA as \n described11. In short, diluted serum (30\u00a0\u00b5L) was added to the Hep-2 cell-coated slide, and phosphate-buffered \nsaline (PBS) was used as a negative control, followed by incubation for 30\u00a0min. Then, the cells were washed \nwith PBS 2 times and incubated with 30\u00a0\u00b5L of goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013Alexa (1:500) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, \nUSA; cat. FA 1512-1010-1) for 30\u00a0min and washed with PBS. Finally, the slides were fixed and analyzed under \na fluorescence microscope. The researcher will be blinded and grade the intensity as 4  = maximal fluorescence \n(brilliant yellow-green), 3 = less brilliant (yellow-green fluorescence), 2 = definite (dull yellow-green), and 1 = very \ndim (subdued fluorescence).\nDetection of anti\u2011dsDNA antibodies\nThe quantitative ELISA for anti-dsDNA was performed from the sera collected two months after treatment using \nthe previous  protocol11. In short, ds-DNA in carbonate coating buffer (10\u00a0\u00b5L/mL) was coated on a 96-well plate \nat 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. Then, the plate was washed with 0.05% Tween-20/PBS (washing buffer) 5 times, and 100\u00a0\u00b5L \nof blocking solution (10% BSA/Tween-20/PBS) was added and incubated at room temperature for 90\u00a0min. \nAfterward, the cells were washed with washing buffer 5 times, 100\u00a0\u00b5L of serum (1:100) was added, and the cells \nwere incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min and washed 5 times. The anti-dsDNA antibody was detected using goat anti-\nmouse IgG conjugated with HRP and ABTS peroxidase substrate; then, the absorption value was measured at \na wavelength of 450\u00a0nm.\nFlow cytometry analysis\nThe spleens were dissected and passed through a 70-\u00b5m filter. Splenocytes were placed in PBS solution and \ncentrifuged at 1500\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to precipitate the cells. The pellet was treated with ACK buffer (NH4Cl, \nKHCO3, and EDTA) to eliminate erythrocytes. The staining protocol was previously  described11 using the \nfollowing antibodies: anti-CD4 (clone: GK1. 5; cat. 100423), CD8 (clone: 53\u20136. 7; cat. 100708), CD62L (clone: \nMEL-14; cat. 104417), CD44 (clone: IM7; cat. 103035), CD3\u03b5 (clone: 145-2C11; cat. 100312), ICOS (clone: \nC398.4A; cat. 313517), CD11c (clone: N418; cat. 117312), B220 (clone: RA3-6B2; cat. 103222), CD11b (clone: \nM1/70; cat. 101228), Ly6c (clone: HK1.4; cat. 128022), Ly6g (clone 1A8; cat. 127608), I-Ab (clone: AF6-120.1; cat. \n116406), PDCA-1 (clone: 129c1; cat. 127103), CD80 (clone: 16-10A1; cat. 104733), GL7 (clone: GL7; cat. 144604), \nand CD138 (clone: 281\u20132; cat. 142506) (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA). The stained cells were dissolved in 1% \nparaformaldehyde/PBS for analysis.\nThe analysis of serum cytokines was performed using the LEGENDplex\u2122 Mouse Inflammation Panel kit \n(Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Cat. No. 740446) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Flow cytometry \nwas performed using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) and analyzed using FlowJo software (USA). \nLEGENDplexTM Data Analysis Software was used to analyze the cytokine data.\nMeasurement of creatinine\nThe evaluation of creatinine in blood and urine was performed using a QuantiChrom\u2122 Creatinine Assay Kit \n(DICT-500) following the manufacturer\u2019s description. The serum was extracted from the blood, and the urine \nwas diluted (1:50). Next, 30\u00a0\u00b5L of the serum and the diluted urine in PBS were dripped into a 96-well plate. Then, \n200\u00a0\u00b5L of the working reagent, a 1:1 ratio of reagents A and B, was added to each well and gently mixed. The light \nabsorption of each sample was measured at 1\u00a0min and 5\u00a0min using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength range \nof 490\u2013530\u00a0nm (with peak absorbance at 510\u00a0nm). The result is calculated using a specific formula (as below: \nn = dilution factor) to evaluate the creatinine levels in the blood and urine samples.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |        (2024) 14:11020  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-61597-z\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/Histopathology\nKidney tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24\u00a0h. Five-micrometer-thick paraffin-embedded \n(FFPE) sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The pathology grading from kidney sections was \nblinded by an experienced researcher. As previously described, the histology scores were reported as glomerular \nand interstitial  scores38\u201339. In brief, glomerular scores were defined as 0 = normal; 1 = focal, mild, or early \nproliferative; 2 = moderate or definite proliferative; 3 = diffuse and focal or diffuse proliferative; 4 = severe diffuse \nproliferative with crescent/sclerosis, and interstitial scores were defined as 0 = normal; 1 = focal or small pockets \n(10\u201315 cells) of mononuclear cells (MNC); 2 = focal infiltrates (15\u201330 cells); 3  = multifocal extensive infiltrates \nwith necrosis; 4  = multifocal or diffuse and extensive with necrosis.\nImmunofluorescence\nThe frozen renal sections were first fixed in acetone and then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. Next, the sections \nwere stained using FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (cat. 4408) or anti-C3c FITC (cat. Ab4212) (Abcam, \nCambridge, MA, USA). Afterward, the samples were stained with DAPI (4\u02b9 ,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, \nDihydrochloride) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at room temperature. Following \nstaining, the slides underwent three washes and were subsequently mounted with ProLongTM Diamond \nAntifade Mountant (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The fluorescent signals were then visualized using ZEISS LSM 800 \nwith Airyscan (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The fluorescence intensity was quantified using ZEISS ZEN Microscope \nSoftware (Carl Zeiss, Germany).\nMeasurement of Total IgG\nThe 96-well plates were coated with 100\u00a0\u00b5L of Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (AffiniPure\u2122) and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C \novernight. The supernatant was removed and washed with 1X PBST three times. Subsequently, the samples \nwere diluted 1:30,000 in 1X PBST. A volume of 100\u00a0\u00b5L of each diluted sample was then added to the wells and \nincubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. Afterward, the clear supernatant was removed, and the wells were washed three times \nwith 1X PBST. Subsequently, 100\u00a0\u00b5L of the secondary antibody (Peroxidase AffiniPure\u2122 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG \n(H + L)), diluted 1:8000 in 1X PBST, was added to each well. The samples were then incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. \nAfter the supernatant was removed, 100\u00a0\u00b5L of the substrate was added to each well and then incubated at room \ntemperature for 20\u00a0min in the dark. Finally, add 2N  H2SO4 to stop the reaction and measure the absorbance \nvalue at 492\u00a0nm using a Cytation\u2122 5 machine.\nStatistical analysis\nFor multiple comparisons, two-tailed ANOV A was used, and p-values were calculated to determine the statistical \nsignificance of differences among groups using GraphPad Prism software (version 7, San Diego, CA, USA). \nData will be expressed for all experiments as the mean  \u00b1 s.e.m., and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically \nsignificant: *p  \u2264 0.05 and **p  \u2264 0.01.\nResults\nISD017 significantly increased the survival of symptomatic Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice\nWe intraperitoneally injected symptomatic Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice (5\u20136\u00a0months old) with ISD017 or cyclophosphamide \nto determine whether ISD017 can be used as a treatment for overt lupus phenotypes compared to the standard \ntreatment, cyclophosphamide (Fig.\u00a0 1A). We screened the level of anti-dsDNA in the experimental mice and \nrandomly assigned the treatment groups. The level of anti-dsDNA between the Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 and treatment groups \ndid not differ (Fig.\u00a0 1B). The survival of the mice was observed during the treatment period. Upon evaluating \nthe viability of laboratory mouse cohorts, all of the mice in the ISD017 treatment (N = 15) and CYC treatment \n(N = 9) groups survived. However, only 11 out of 20 mice in the PBS treatment group survived. We observed \nthat Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice survived significantly longer in the ISD017- and CYC-treated mice than the non-treated \nFcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice (p = 0.004). All ISD017- and CYC-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice survived throughout the treatment, \nwhile 55% of the non-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice died (Fig.\u00a0 1C).\nISD017 reduced the severity of glomerulonephritis in Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice\nThe Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice showed serum creatinine levels higher than WT mice at the same age (Fig.\u00a0 2A). The mice \ntreated with ISD017 and CYC showed comparable serum creatinine levels with non-treated mice (Fig.\u00a0 2A); \nhowever, only CYC reduced the urine protein/creatinine ratio (Fig.\u00a0 2B). Next, the histological findings of the \nkidneys by H&E staining showed that Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice developed fibrocellular crescent, glomerulosclerosis, and \ninterstitial infiltration, while the treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice with ISD017 and CYC had less severe disease (Fig.\u00a0 2C, \ntop row). The kidney glomerular scores (Fig.\u00a0 2D) and interstitial scores (Fig.\u00a0 2E) in both treatment groups were \nsignificantly decreased compared to those in non-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice. The immunofluorescence staining of \nIgG (Fig.\u00a0 3C, middle row, and 3F) in the ISD017- and CYC-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice were reduced.

However, the intensity of ANA staining was reduced in ISD017 and CYC-\ntreated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice. The analysis of ANA levels revealed that the untreated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 group had significantly \nhigher values than WT mice and the two treatment groups (Fig.\u00a0 3B). However, no statistically significant \ndifference was observed in the anti-dsDNA level after the treatment among the Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 groups (Fig.\u00a0 3C). After \nthe normalization of anti-dsDNA, the ratio of anti-dsDNA (before/after) did not show a difference between \ntreated groups and non-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.\u00a0 3D). Next, we tested the total IgG to see the treatment \neffect. The CYC-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice tend to have lower IgG levels but did not reach the statistical significance \n(Fig.\u00a0 3E). The expansion of spontaneous germinal center B cells has been shown in Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212  mice40, and germinal \ncenter formation is required to exclude autoreactive B  cells41. Then, we identified germinal center B cells using \nGL-7hiFAShi staining (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01A) and did not detect the reduction of this subset by the ISD017 \nand CYC treatment (Fig.\u00a0 3F,G). Next, we looked at the activating state of B cells by using the GL-7+ and  IAb+. \nHowever, GL-7+ B cells significantly decreased in percentages (Fig.\u00a0 3H) and absolute cell numbers (Fig.\u00a0 3I) in \nCYC-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice. Similarly, the percentage (Fig.\u00a0 3J) and total cell numbers (Fig.\u00a0 3K) of  B220+IAb+ \ncells were significantly lower in the CYC-treated mice. However, no significant difference was found between \nthe non-treated and ISD-017-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice. The  B220+ cells showed a comparable mean fluorescence \nFigure\u00a01.

Notably, the expression of plasma cells showed \nno difference among the three Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 groups in percentage (Fig.\u00a0 3L) and absolute cell numbers (Fig.\u00a0 3M).\nISD017 restricted the expansion of activated T cells\nWe investigated the targeted effector cells of ISD017 treatment compared to CYC treatment.  CD4+CD45RBhi \ncells are described as na\u00efve effector T  cells42. The ISD017- and CYC-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice showed an increase in \nthe percentage of  CD4+CD45RBhi cells compared to non-treated mice (Fig.\u00a0 4A). However, only CYC treatment \nincreased the absolute number of these cells (Fig.\u00a0 4B). In addition, only ISD017 limited the expansion of activated \nT cells  (CD4+CD69+) in Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.\u00a0 4C,D). Although ISD017 did not decrease the MFI of CD69 on  CD4+ \nT cells compared to Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 control mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01C), the CYC-treated mice showed significantly \nhigher CD69 expression on  CD4+ T cells than Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 control mice and ISD017 treated mice (Supplementary \nFig.\u00a01C). Next, we gated  CD3+CD4+ on the CD44 and CD62L (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01D) to identify the effector \nmemory T cells  (TEM or  CD44+CD62L-) and central memory T cells  (TCM or  CD44+CD62L+). While both ISD017 \nand CYC treatment significantly reduced the number of  CD4+CD44+CD62L-  (TEM) cells compared to that in \nnon-treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.\u00a0 4E-4F), only CYC treatment increased the number of  CD4+CD44+CD62L+ \n (TCM) cells (Fig.\u00a0 4G-4H).\nISD017 diminished the expansion of neutrophils and the production of IL \u20111\u03b2\nInnate immunity is critical for lupus  development43. The expansion of myeloid dendritic cells and neutrophils \nin Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice have been previously  described11,40. Then, we analyzed the treatment effect on myeloid \ndendritic cells  (CD11b+CD11c+) (Fig.\u00a0 5A,B) and did not detect the difference in the absolute number of this \npopulation (Fig.\u00a0 5B). To better identify more specific mature dendritic cells, we analyzed the  CD11b+CD11c+IAb+ \ncells (Fig.\u00a0 5C,D) and did not identify the difference in the number of  CD11b+CD11c+IAb+ cells among the \nFcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.\u00a0 5D). Next, we identified the effect of treatment on neutrophils  (Ly6c+Ly6g+) (Fig.\u00a0 5E,F). \nAlthough ISD017 and CYC did not change the percentage of neutrophils (Fig.\u00a0 5E), ISD017 significantly reduced \nthe total number of neutrophils (Fig.\u00a0 5F). Furthermore, ISD017 reduced serum IL-1\u03b2 in the treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice \n(Fig.\u00a0 5G) but did not change the IL-6 level (Fig.\u00a0 5H).\nISD017 reduced the expression of interferon\u2011inducible genes in Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice\nThe kidneys of Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice showed reduced expression of interferon-inducible genes (Mx1 and Isg15) and \ninterferon regulatory factors (Irf3  and Irf7 ) in the absence of  Sting11. Next, we tested whether ISD017 can \neffectively inhibit type I IFN signaling. We analyzed the expression of these genes in the kidneys of ISD017-treated \nFigure\u00a04.

ISD017 decreased the expression of Irf7, Isg15 and Mx1 (Fig.\u00a0 6B\u2013D) but not Irf3  (Fig.\u00a0 6A). \nHowever, CYC treatment suppressed the expression of Irf3  (Fig.\u00a0 6A) and Isg15 (Fig.\u00a0 6C) but not Irf7  (Fig.\u00a0 6B) \nand Mx1 (Fig.\u00a0 6D).\nDiscussion\nThe increased levels of type I IFN and the upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been consistently \nobserved in the blood and tissues of SLE patients and suggested severe disease  activity44. This dysregulated \nproduction of type I IFN is thought to arise from the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and the \naberrant recognition of self-nucleic acids, leading to the induction of IFN-responsive genes and the subsequent \npromotion of autoimmune  responses45. STING is an intracellular sensor that recognizes cytosolic DNA and \ntriggers the production of type I IFN and proinflammatory  cytokines46. Mice with enhanced type I IFN signaling \nor overexpression of STING exhibit lupus-like features. Conversely, suppressing STING signaling ameliorates \nFigure\u00a05.

Inhibition of type I IFN using monoclonal antibodies \nor small molecules has shown promising results in reducing disease activity in SLE  patients7. Similarly, STING \ninhibitors are being developed as potential therapeutic agents to modulate aberrant immune responses in SLE.\nISD017, a STING inhibitor, blocks the trafficking of STING from the ER to the Golgi, reducing inflammatory \ncytokines and type I interferon  production34. ISD017 is specific to dsDNA-activated Sting but not MAVS or \n TRIF34. A previous study showed that ISD017 administration at a young age in Fcgr2b-deficient mice can reduce \nanti-dsDNA, inflammatory cytokines, and  glomerulonephritis34. However, ISD017-treated preclinical lupus-\nprone mice might not represent the actual clinical situation of SLE patients with overt active lupus phenotypes. \nThus, we treated symptomatic lupus mice that presented with autoantibodies and proteinuria with ISD017 or the \nstandard treatment (cyclophosphamide) and compared the efficacy and targeted effector cells of these 2 reagents.\nTreatment with ISD017 and CYC reduced the mortality of Fcgr2b-deficient lupus mice with a comparable \nsurvival rate, suggesting that ISD017 could be a therapeutic drug for SLE. Although the mice did not show a \ndifference in serum creatinine among the groups, only CYC reduced the urine protein creatinine ratio during \nthe treatment period of 2\u00a0months. CYC is an alkylating agent that is cycle-cell nonspecific. It exerts a marked \naction against cells in the dividing phase and may also alkylate quiescent cells, which could reduce proteinuria \nin glomerular  diseases49. Based on the treatment in human SLE, the duration of induction therapy for lupus \nnephritis is 6\u00a0months. Although the effect of ISD017 treatment did not change proteinuria (urine albumin/\nurine creatinine ratio), the reason could be derived from the short treatment interval in this study (2\u00a0months). \nIf ISD017 treatment is extended longer than 2\u00a0months, the proteinuria may reduce. One limitation of our study \nis the omission of the total proteinuria score, recognized as a valuable indicator of lupus nephritis activity.\nSome studies show that proteinuria did not correlate with renal activity because persistent protein could occur \nfrom active nephritis or inactive fibrosis. The follow-up studies of kidney biopsy in SLE patients after treatment of \nlupus nephritis showed that proteinuria did not predict the activity of  glomerulonephritis50\u201352. Thus, we assessed \nthe efficacy of ISD017 by measuring the histopathology of the kidney representing lupus nephritis. ISD017 and \nCYC significantly reduced glomerular and interstitial scores, confirming the ability of ISD017 to decrease the \nseverity of lupus nephritis, similar to standard CYC treatment. In addition, ISD017 showed a significant reduction \nof IgG and C3c deposition in the glomeruli. We believe that the effect of ISD017 treatment is significant in \nchanging renal pathology and increasing the survival of treated mice compared to untreated mice. These data \nsuggested that the efficacy of ISD017 is at least comparable to that of CYC.\nAutoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) indicate impaired B cell function. This impairment \ncan stem from intrinsic dysfunctions within B cells or indirect stimulation caused by SLE. The presence of anti-\nnuclear antibody (ANA) serves as an essential marker for autoimmune diseases. Detection of ANA is a screening \nfor autoantibodies against self-antigens, which contains polyclonal specificity of  autoantibodies53. ANA can occur \nafter polyclonal B cell  activation54. The ANA patterns of serum from the Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice showed homogenous \nand fine-speckled patterns, which did not change by the treatment. The observed homogenous patterns in the \nANA staining are indicative of anti-dsDNA specificity. The presence of multiple ANA staining patterns in the \nFcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice suggests the existence of various autoantibodies.\nWe opted to focus on anti-dsDNA antibodies due to their noted association with the lupus nephritis \nphenotype and anti-dsDNA change in a previous paper on the double deficiency of Fcgr2b and Sting   mice11. \nAnti-dsDNA is a pathogenic autoantibody in lupus  nephritis55. However, anti-dsDNA partly correlates with \nSLE disease  activity56. The sensitivity of the anti-dsDNA level might not represent the lupus nephritis activity in \nour experiment. This result may be explained by the short duration of treatment (2\u00a0months), and the treatment \ndid not reduce the number of plasma cells. The reduction in ANA but not anti-dsDNA and total IgG after \nISD017 and CYC treatment suggested that these drugs may target specific activated B cells but not plasma cells. \nThe observation that treatment reduced ANA levels without a corresponding decrease in anti-dsDNA suggests \nthat the therapeutic intervention may preferentially impact autoantibodies other than anti-dsDNA. These \npotentially affected autoantibodies were not identified within the scope of this study, representing a limitation \nof our research.\nThe germinal center serves as the site where B cells encounter antigens presented by APCs, leading to their \ndifferentiation. Germinal center B cells actively proliferate, causing somatic  hypermutation57. Fully differentiated \nplasma cells are dormant and show less  proliferation58. Both CYC and ISD017 did not reduce the germinal \ncenter B cells  (B220+GL7+FAS+) and plasma cells  (B220+CD138+). However, only CYC reduced activated B \ncells  (B220+GL7+). While the MFI of IAb on B cells represents the activation of B cells, we did not detect the \ndifference in MFI between the non-treated and treated Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 groups. However, the number and percentage of \n B220+IAb+ cells were decreased by CYC treatment. The discrepancy in the IAb data could be that some  B220+ cells \nshowed a mixed response to the treatment, creating the  IAbhi and  IAblow cells, which may cause high variability \nand make MFI at an insignificant level. However, the number of  IAb+B220+ cells represented B cells with  IAbhi, \nwhich may suggest the readiness of B cells for presenting antigens to activate  CD4+ T cells. CYC is an alkylating \nagent that preferentially attacks proliferating cells and has less influence on quiescent cells. The data suggested \ndifferent targeted mechanisms between ISD017 and CYC. Additionally, previous research has provided evidence \nhighlighting the crucial role of CYC, a specific substance, in regulating the expression and function of critical \ncells involved in B cell  immunity59.\nEffector memory T cells are the major producers of inflammatory cytokines and provide help for B cell \nproliferation. Moreover, T cell activation also contributes to B cell activation, leading to autoantibody secretion \nand causing damage to various  tissues60. While ISD017 and CYC effectively reduced the expansion of effector \nmemory T cells, the number of activated na\u00efve T cells increased during CYC treatment. ISD017 decreased the \nexpansion of  CD69+CD4+ T cells but did not decrease the MFI of CD69 on  CD4+ T cells. This data suggested \nthat ISD017 may inhibit the differentiation of mature T cells but did not directly act on T cell activation. Given \n11\nVol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |        (2024) 14:11020  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-61597-z\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/that we did not evaluate T-follicular or T-regulatory cells in our study, whether ISD017 impacts these cell types \nremains unclear.\nCD69 is an early-activated marker, and its expression on T cells leads to cytokine production and cell \n proliferation61. The interaction between these cells and dendritic cells, facilitated by the MHC molecule, triggers \nthe activation of  CD69+ T cells. As a result, significant changes occur in cell function, leading to the differentiation \nof Th1 or Th17 cells and a notable increase in the production of various  cytokines62. While ISD017 did not \ndecrease anti-dsDNA levels, an earlier study reported a strong correlation between the expression levels of \nCD69 and the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI)  score63. Therefore,  CD69+ T cells may be pathogenic, causing \nactive disease activity. The fact that we did not test the T-follicular cells or T-regulatory cells, we could not know \nwhether ISD017 affects these cells or not.\nGranulocytes can disrupt the normal functioning of B-cell or T-cell immune cells, leading to the production \nof type-I interferons, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and a proliferation-\ninducing ligand (APRIL). The complex interaction among these factors is crucial for driving the proliferation \npathways involved in SLE and regulating epigenetic expression, which can negatively affect SLE development and \n progression64. These granulocytes form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) when activated by autoantibodies, \nreleasing large DNA complexes\u2014this immune complex triggers the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, \nthe primary source of type-I interferons. Imbalances in NET production and elimination may be pivotal in \nadvancing  disease65.\nNotably, experimental studies utilizing lupus models have provided compelling evidence supporting the link \nbetween increased expression of IL-1\u03b2 and the severity and accelerated progression of the  disease66,67. IL-1\u03b2 \nknockout in lupus-prone NZM2328 mice still leads to the development of lupus  phenotypes68. This finding \nsuggested that the other signaling pathway is required for lupus development in NZM2328 mice. STING-\nmediated lysosomal damage activates NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent  pyroptosis69. The reduction in IL-1\u03b2 \nin the ISD017-treated mice should be an effect of STING inhibition in this model. Activation of the STING \npathway induces type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-\u03b170. Here, we detected \na reduction in interferon-inducible genes but not IL-6. IL-6 in Fcgr2b-deficient mice may be produced via a \nSTING-independent pathway.\nISD-017 effectively reduced the expansion of granulocytes  (Ly6c+Ly6g+) and the production of IL-1\u03b2, an \ninflammasome-mediated cytokine, but CYC did not. However, the kidney pathology of Fcgr2b-deficient mice \nshowed  NETs40. Netosis of neutrophils can activate complement  cascade71. The immunofluorescence staining \nof C3c was significantly reduced with ISD017 but not CYC. The effect of ISD017 in rescued lupus nephritis \nmay be derived from the reduction in neutrophils, NETs formation, and complement activation. STING \ncan activate IRF3 and IRF7 to induce type I IFN  production72. The absence of Sting  in Fcgr2b-deficient mice \ndecreased the expression of both Irf3  and Irf7  in the  kidney11. Treatment with ISD017 and CYC targeted different \ninterferon-inducible genes in the kidney of Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice. Both ISD017 and CYC reduced Isg15 expression, \nwith CYC showing more effect than ISD017. CYC suppressed Irf3  expression better than ISD017. However, \nISD017 suppressed Irf7  and Mx1 in the kidneys of Fcgr2b-deficient mice. The data suggested that ISD017 and \nCYC preferentially inhibited interferon-inducible genes in the kidney, which lessened glomerulonephritis in \nFcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 mice.\nIt should be noted that this study does not provide information on long-term survival and potential long-\nterm side effects. Further research is necessary to explore these aspects comprehensively. It would be interesting \nto see the effect of ISD017 in other lupus mouse models, which is beyond the scope of this study. Due to some \ncontroversies regarding STING function in mouse models and the heterogeneity of lupus disease, further study \nof STING function in other mouse models or human SLE is needed to clarify the beneficial role of targeting \nSTING-mediated signaling in a specific subgroup of SLE.\nIn summary, ISD017 rescued lupus nephritis in symptomatic129.B6. Fcgr2b-deficient mice. While CYC \ntargeted activated B cells, ISD017 targeted activated T cells and neutrophils. Since ISD017 impacts different \nparameters compared to cyclophosphamide, it presents a unique opportunity to be used in conjunction \nwith cyclophosphamide in treatment protocols.
