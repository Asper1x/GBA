RNA conformations are generally\nstrongly affected by positively charged metal ions (especially Mg2+). We have quantitatively explored the combined effect\nof ligand (2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032-dG) and Mg2+binding on the energy landscape of the aptamer domain of the 2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032-dG riboswitch with both ex-\nplicit solvent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (99 \u03bcsec aggregate sampling for the study) and selective 2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032-hydroxyl\nacylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) experiments. We show that both ligand and Mg2+are required for the sta-\nbilization of the aptamer domain; however, the two factors act with different modalities. The addition of Mg2+remodels the\nenergy landscape and reduces its frustration by the formation of additional contacts. In contrast, the binding of 2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032-dG elim-\ninates the metastable states by nucleating a compact core for the aptamer domain. Mg2+ions and ligand binding are re-\nquired to stabilize the least stable helix, P1 (which needs to unfold to activate the transcription platform), and theriboswitch core formed by the backbone of the P2 and P3 helices. Mg\n2+and ligand also facilitate a more compact structure\nin the three-way junction region.\nKeywords: magnesium; RNA folding; mRNA structure; molecular dynamics; riboswitch\nINTRODUCTION\nRiboswitches are structured RNA elements located in the\n5\u2032-untranslated regions of bacterial mRNAs. They can reg-\nulate the transcription or translation of downstream mRNAs\nin response to the specific binding of small molecules. To\ndate, three purine-sensing riboswitches have been discov-ered, which sense adenine (Mandal and Breaker 2004),\nguanine (Mandal et al. 2003), or 2\n\u2032-deoxyguanosine (2\u2032-\ndG) (Kim et al. 2007). Their characterization has helped elu-cidate mechanisms of gene regulation by riboswitches.\nThe 2\n\u2032-dG riboswitch is a close variant of the guanine-sens-\ning riboswitches (Kim et al. 2007). Biochemical and phylo-genetic analyses of this family have indicated that the\nmetabolite-binding aptamer domain adopts a distinct or-\nganization of three helices (P1, P2, and P3) around thethree-way junction, which serves as the ligand-binding\npocket (Fig. 1; Mandal et al. 2003; Mandal and Breaker\n2004; Kim et al. 2007). These purine-sensing riboswitchesalso share similar 3D structures. The P1 helix from the ribo-\nswitch aptamer domain, whose two strands are distal in\nsequence, can either aid in the formation of the ligand-binding pocket or form an alternative helix with a down-\nstream sequence, forming the expression platform and\nswitching the conformation of the riboswitch between theON and OFF states. The P2 and P3 helices both have\nstem \u2013loop structures. Their loop regions, L2 and L3, inter-\nact with each other to form tertiary contacts constitutingthe pseudoknot (PK) interaction. In terms of function, the\npurine-sensing riboswitches encompass a diverse mode\nof riboswitch-mediated gene regulation. The xpt-pbuX\nBacillus subtilis riboswitch regulates gene expression by\nacting as a transcriptional OFF switch (Mandal et al.\nCorresponding author: kys@lanl.gov\nHandling editor: Eric WesthofArticle is online at http://www.rnajournal.org/cgi/doi/10.1261/rna\n.079767.123.

On the other hand, the addVV\nVibrio cholerae riboswitch is a translational ON switch\n(Wacker et al. 2011).\nThe 2\u2032-dG riboswitch transcriptionally regulates the gene\nencoding the ribonucleotide reductase subunit \u03b2(Kim et al.\n2007; Wacker et al. 2011), where the ligand, 2\u2032-dG, is base-\npaired to residue C80 positioned at J31 (Pikovskaya et al.2011), as elucidated by the crystal structure. NMR studies\nsuggest that the ON \u2013OFF states are regulated by breaking\nthe P1 helix and forming a new helix between part of the P1helix and the expression platform of the riboswitch in the\nabsence of ligand binding during the transcription process\n(Helmling et al. 2017, 2018). To fully understand the ribo-switch operation, it is crucial to understand how the struc-\nture (Pikovskaya et al. 2011) and the mode of regulation\n(Kim et al. 2007) of the downstream genes depend on thesubtle structural modulation of the aptamer domain of\nthe riboswitch, especially the P1 helix.\nIn terms of molecular simulation studies, explicit-solvent\nsimulations have been applied to the SAM-sensing\naptamer domain, revealing the glassy behavior of Mg\n2+\nsurrounding the RNA molecule and the general mecha-\nnism of Mg2+mediation of RNA fluctuation (Hayes et al.\n2012). Later, by the combination of SHAPE probing (selec-\ntive 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) ex-\nperiments and GEM (generalized electrostatic model)\nsimulations (Hayes et al. 2015), the change in dynamics be-\ntween the conformational ensembles characterizing thefree state of the SAM-sensing aptamer domain and the\nSAM-bound complex have been mapped and revealed\nkey insights into structural preorganization and Mg\n2+re-quirements for ligand binding at nucleotide resolution\n(Roy et al. 2019). Here, we investigate, in detail, the effect\nof the Mg2+ion concentration on the ligand-free aptamer\nstructure and the ligand-induced RNA folding pathway\nof the aptamer domain of the 2\u2032-dG riboswitch from\nMesoplasma forum (mfl-aptamer). To quantitatively cap-\nture the nonlinear effects of ligand and Mg2+binding, the\napo and holo structures of the mfl-aptamer (Fig. 1) were in-\nvestigated by both detailed explicit-solvent simulationsand SHAPE probing experiments in the wetlab. Our com-\nputational and experimental studies have provided a struc-\ntural basis for the RNA aptamer response to the Mg\n2+\nconcentration and ligand needed for the recognition of\nthe 2\u2032-dG, suggesting potential pathways of conformation\nchanges.\nIn particular, our study reveals that both ligand and Mg2+\nare required for a well-funneled energy landscape for themfl-aptamer. We show how ligand binding stabilizes the\nP1 helix, the junction region, and the riboswitch core by in-\nducing a more compact core. We also show how Mg\n2+\nbinding stabilizes these regions by bridging negatively\ncharged RNA backbone regions. Mg2+helps to reduce\nthe frustration of the system and remodel the energy land-\nscape by forming specific interactions. Importantly, thebinding of ligand directly eliminates the metastable states\nand remodels the energy landscape into a single basin. The\nstudy of the stability of the P1 helix also helps to shed lighton the conformational change mechanism between tran-\nscription OFF and ON states for the entire 2\n\u2032-dG ribo-\nswitch, of which the P1 helix destabilization plays a majorrole. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore\nthe combined effects of ligand binding and Mg\n2+on the\nmfl-aptamer at the atomistic level with a full physical model\nAB\nFIGURE 1.

Eight parallel sim-\nulations were performed for each condition. Every simula-\ntion performed was 2 \u00b5sec in duration. The simulationsshow that the overall fluctuations of the aptamer domain\nof 2\n\u2032-dG riboswitch from M. forum (mlf-aptamer) are influ-\nenced by the concentration of ions and are also dependenton the presence and absence of ligand binding. The aver-\nage root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and the radius of\ngyration show that the system has larger fluctuations com-pared with the crystal structure when there is no Mg\n2+in thesystem or in the absence of a bound ligand. Conversely, in\nthe presence of Mg2+and ligand, the system has lower fluc-\ntuations and is more stable (Fig. 2).\nThe RMSD curves suggest that (1) metastable states may\nexist in the absence of Mg2+and ligand, possibly related to\nmore disordered structures of the mlf-aptamer, and (2)\nthese disordered states are suppressed in the presence\nof either ligand or Mg2+(Fig. 2B \u2013D;Supplemental Fig.\nS4). Although the global fluctuations of the aptamer\ndomain decrease substantially as the Mg2+concentration\nchanges from 0 to 5 mM, the fluctuation level does notchange significantly as the Mg\n2+concentration changes\nfrom 5 to 20 mM. This may be related to the fact that the\nnumber of Mg2+ions condensed onto the RNA changes\nmuch more slowly compared to the overall Mg2+concen-\ntration. That is, the localization sites of Mg2+close to the\nRNA may be saturated. Interestingly, when both ligandand Mg\n2+are absent in the system, although the mlf-\naptamer is still well-organized, additional disordered states\nhave emerged and are considerably populated (Fig. 2A).\nTo explicitly study the metastable states in more detail,\nwe computed the free energy landscapes for the different\ncases. The principal component (PC) analysis is applied to\nA\nCDB\nFIGURE 2. Global RMSD for the first four of eight replicas with different conditions at 300 K. ( A) Case without Mg2+(0 mM Mg2+) and without ligand\n(dG[\u2212]). (B) Case without Mg2+(0 mM Mg2+) and with ligand (dG[+]). ( C) Case with Mg2+(5 mM Mg2+) and without ligand (dG[ \u2212]). (D) Case with\nMg2+(5 mM Mg2+) and with ligand (dG[+]). In general, the fluctuations of the system become lower with the addition of either the ligand or Mg2+.\nMetastable states with larger fluctuation exist without Mg2+or ligand but are not heavily populated. However, in the absence of both ligand and\nMg2+, these partially disordered states emerge in the overall population.Ding et al.\n994 RNA (2024) Vol. 30, No. 8\nstudy the fluctuations of the mlf-aptamer. The Cartesian co-\nordinates of all the heavy atoms of the RNA molecule areused as the variable set. The covariance matrix was calculat-\ned and then diagonalized to obtain the PCs. The free ener-\ngy in the PC1 \u2013PC2 space (Fig. 3; Supplemental Fig. S5 )\nshows that the mlf-aptamer has a well-funneled energy\nlandscape with a clear, single basin in the most stable\ncase (both ligand and Mg\n2+present). In the absence of li-\ngand, consistent with the RMSD results, the energy land-\nscape is rugged and this ruggedness increases as [Mg2+]\ndecreases. In the absence of Mg2+, the energy landscape\nis slightly rugged in the presence of ligand; however,\nwhen both ligand and Mg2+are absent, the energy land-\nscape is much flatter and rugged with nonnative structuresbecoming heavily populated. Consistent with the RMSD\nresults, these results indicate that the frustration of the en-ergy landscape is reduced by ligand binding and divalent\ncation condensation. More specifically, although the bind-ing of Mg\n2+helps confine the energy landscape, the com-\nplete elimination of metastable states requires the binding\nof the ligand.\nLocal fluctuations: P2 and P3 helices\nTo explore the contribution of distinct parts of the ribo-switch to the global fluctuations, we align the simulationtrajectories to the crystal structure and then analyze the\nkey regions \u2014helixes (P1, P2, and P3), loops (L2 and L3),\nand junctions (J12, J23, and J31) \u2014by calculating the\nRMSD for each region. The stability of P2 and P3 helices\nare similar in general, and the subtle difference in stability\nis sensitive to the method of measurement. Previous\nAB\nCD\nFIGURE 3.

When ligand and Mg2+are both\nabsent, the energy landscape is rugged with the emergence of many metastable states. Upon the addition of Mg2+, the energy landscape becomes\nmore confined, but the nonnative structures are still populated. However, the binding of the ligand eliminates the local minima and restrains the sys -\ntem in its native structure. With the presence of both ligand and Mg2+, the system shows a well-funneled energy landscape at the global minimum.Landscape of mRNA elements\nwww.rnajournal.org 995\nstudies on two types of adenine ribo-\nswitches have shown, by computation(Lin et al. 2014) and single-molecule\nforce spectroscopy experiments (Gre-\nenleaf et al. 2008; Neupane et al.2011), that the P2 and P3 helices can\nchange the order of their stabilities\neven with slight changes in the se-quence. Consistently, fluorescence\nmethods have shown that the addad-\nenine riboswitch has a dynamic P2 he-lix that can be suppressed by ligand\nbinding or Mg\n2+addition, showing\nthat its P2 helix is more sensitive tothe environment (St-Pierre et al.\n2021). However, the similar studies\non the xptguanine riboswitch suggest\na more stable P2 helix by single-mole-\ncule force spectroscopy (Chandra\net al. 2017) and yet a more dynamicP2 helix from the fluorescence study\n(Brenner et al. 2010). This demon-\nstrates the ambiguities around theconcept of the overall \u201cstability \u201dof\nan RNA element, as it may correspond\nto the measurement of different prop-erties in different contexts.\nThe average regional RMSD (Fig.\n4A) shows that helix P2 has slightly\nlarger average fluctuations than P3\nwhen Mg\n2+is present. On the other\nhand, when it comes to the stability\nof internal base pairs, although their\ndissociation probability is small, tra-jectories show that base pairs are\nmore likely to break in the P3 helix\nthan in the P2 helix ( Supplemental\nFig. S6 ), especially those close to the\nL3 loop. The decreased stability of\nthe P3 helix (compared with the P2 he-lix) is also suggested by the average\nfluctuations at the residue level (Fig.\n4B), which may occur because thereare a greater number of less stable\nA-U pairs in the P3 helix than P2.\nWhen Mg\n2+is removed from the\nsystem, the RMSD of the P3 helix in-\ncreases more than that of the P2 helix.\nThe P3 helix has likely been influencedby the weakened pocket region and\nthe P1 helix. This effect becomes\nmore obvious when the ligand is alsoremoved (see the section Local fluctu-\nations: binding pocket and the P1\nhelix).\nA\nB\nFIGURE 4. Regional fluctuation analysis. ( A) Average regional RMSD for different conditions at\n300 K, eight replicas combined. At room temperature, helices have similar scale of fluctuationwith the presence of ligand. When the ligand is unbound, the fluctuation of the P1 helix and\njunctions increase the most, and the stability of P3 helix is also influenced with the further remov-\nal of Mg\n2+. The PK (loops, red) is the most flexible motif with the presence of ligand, but its fluc-\ntuations are not sensitive to the change of conditions. ( B) Structure of mlf-aptamer colored by\nheat map of root-mean-square-fluctuation (RMSF) of different conditions at 300 K with eightreplicas combined. Consistent with the RMSD analysis, the fluctuation in the P1 helix and pocket\nregion becomes larger with the removal of either ligand or Mg\n2+, and the fluctuation of the PK is\nrather independent of the ligand and Mg2+condition.Ding et al.\n996 RNA (2024) Vol. 30, No. 8\nLocal fluctuations: binding pocket and the P1 helix\nThe binding pocket is composed of three junctions \u2014\nnamely, J12, J23, and J31. In this region, the 2\u2032dG ligand\nforms a Watson \u2013Crick base pair with C80 located in J31.\nMoreover, the regions of P1, P2, and P3 helices close to\nthe junctional regions are also involved in the pocket envi-ronment because of their adjacency in sequence. We ob-\nserve that the fluctuations of the junctions become larger\nwith the removal of ligand or Mg\n2+(Fig. 4), confirming\nthat both ligand and Mg2+are involved in stabilizing the\nbinding pocket. PC analysis shows that the pocket fluctu-\nates in different modalities when either Mg2+or ligand is\nremoved. The fluctuations in the former condition are\ninduced by the separation of the P2 and P3 helices (see\nthe section Riboswitch core). In the latter case, the fluctua-tions are induced by the vibration of the J23 portion.\nBecause the P1 helix is formed by two strands distal in se-\nquence and both are linked to the binding pocket, fluctua-tions of P1 are coupled with the binding pocket, which is\nalso reflected in the RMSD (Fig. 4).\nIn the presence of Mg\n2+, the perturbation of base pairs\ndoes not affect the overall structural integrity of the P1 he-\nlix, although PC analysis reveals that the motion of the P1\nhelix under this condition includes twisting, bending, andstretching (see details in Supplemental Movies S1 \u2013S18).\nIn the absence of Mg\n2+, dissociation of P1 helix base\npairs is rarely observed in the presence of ligand, but maycause altered stacking inside the helix, changing the con-\nformation of the P1 helix transiently (Fig. 2B; Supplemental\nFig. S6 ). When both ligand and Mg\n2+are absent, the disso-\nciation of the P1 helix (Fig. 5B; Supplemental Fig. S6 ) be-\ncomes much more frequent, showing a stronger alternate\nstacking effect, resulting in the two-state behavior (Fig.5A) discussed in the section Global fluctuations. In these\ncases where the P1 helix is distorted, the P3 helix can also\nshow larger fluctuations (Fig. 5A), whereas the P2 helix re-mains less affected in all eight replicas. This different\nbehavior between the P2 and P3 helices might result\nfrom the fact that the P3 helix is separated from the P1 helixby two residues (whereas the P2 helix is separated by\nthree), and shares the major groove with P1. However,\namong all the simulations we conducted, it appears thatthe alternate stacking only happens within the P1 helix,\nwhich induces fluctuations in the pocket region and the\nP3 helix as well. Meanwhile, the base pair dissociation ofthe P3 helix can only amplify the fluctuations in the junction\nregion with no alternate stacking ( Supplemental Fig. S8 ).\nThis implies that the dynamics of the system is more sensi-tive to the P1 helix (the mechanism will be discussed in the\nsection Mechanism of ion and ligand regulation), which\nmay help elucidate the conformational change of the mlf-\naptamer, which starts with the melting of the P1 helix, in\nthe gene expression regulation process. This process\nserves as a general mechanism for gene expression regula-tion in the purine-sensing riboswitch family. Our results are\nconsistent with previous single-molecule force spectro-scopy experiments on pubE andaddadenine riboswitches\n(Greenleaf et al. 2008; Neupane et al. 2011), xptguanine\nriboswitch (Chandra et al. 2017), and simulations of theadd adenine riboswitches (Di Palma et al. 2013). These\nstudies have shown that the P1 helix is the least stable helix\nof the aptamer domain of both, and that the stability of theP1 helix is ligand-dependent. Similarly, serial femtosecond\ncrystallography also showed that the P1 helix in the apo\nstate is notably less stable than the ligand-bound state intheaddadenine riboswitch (Stagno et al. 2017).\nLocal fluctuations: the pseudoknot\nThe two loops \u2014namely, L2 and L3 \u2014form a kissing loop\nidentified as an HHH-type PK (Peselis and Serganov\n2014) on the top of the mlf-aptamer, and show a large\nbut consistent fluctuation amplitude among different con-ditions at 300 K, except when both ligand and Mg\n2+are ab-\nsent (Fig. 4). This leads to two hypotheses: First, the PK is\nless stable than helices; second, unlike the guanine ribo-switch (Nguyen et al. 2009), the fluctuation and formation\nof the PK of the mlf-aptamer might not be coupled with li-\ngand binding.\nTo better understand this phenomenon, two base pairs\n(G45 \u2013C69 and G46 \u2013C68) and an essential base stacking in-\nteraction (A42 \u2013A71) from the PK were studied (Fig. 5C,D).\nThis metric demonstrates that these native interactions (or\nnative contacts) present in the crystal structure can detach\nat room temperature, which, in turn, causes regional distor-tion and deviation from the crystal structure of the PK re-\ngion. However, this distortion of the PK contributes very\nlittle to the overall conformational because the overallstructure is still preserved, even when some of the native\ncontacts are dissociated. This stability is interesting\nbecause the PK has fewer base pairs and therefore lessbase stacking compared with the helices. The crystal struc-\nture indicates that the novel lock-and-key loop motif (in-\ncluding A42 \u2013A71 stacking) might be crucial to the PK\nformation because it contributes more than half of the\nloop \u2013loop contact surface (Pikovskaya et al. 2011). Our sim-\nulations also indicate that this structure might be at least asstable as the base pairs in the PK (G46 \u2013C69 and G46 \u2013C68),\nas the breaking of G45 \u2013C69 has little effect on the overall\nformation of the PK. Moreover, even if the base stackingdissociates, the \u201ckey\u201d(A71) can still stay in the \u201clocked \u201d\nconformation by L2. This could be attributed to the fact\nthat, due to the large contact surface, A71 can form diversecontacts (base stacking and hydrogen bonds) with L2 other\nthan the native ones.\nPrevious NMR results have indicated the presence of a\nreverse Hoogsteen base pair between U41 and A71\n(Wacker et al. 2011); however, this conformation was not\ndetected in the crystal structure, where the two bases areLandscape of mRNA elements\nwww.rnajournal.org 997\nA\nB\nC\nD\nFIGURE 5.

Although the number of contacts of PK\nis small, the dissociation of them only causes local distortion, which does not melt the PK and has little effect on global fluctuation. Distances be-\ntween base pairs are measured as the distance between the N1 atom of purine bases and the N3 atom of pyrimidine bases. The distance for base\nstacking is defined as the distance between the center of mass of the bases.Ding et al.\n998 RNA (2024) Vol. 30, No. 8\nperpendicular to each other (Pikovskaya et al. 2011). In sim-\nulations, this conformation was found to have a lifetime of\u223c100 nsec under several conditions. This can explain how\nthe PK could be effectively both \u201cstable \u201dand \u201cunstable \u201d\nsimultaneously. We conclude that the PK is indeed less sta-ble; on the other hand, the free energy landscape might be\nrelatively flat for the PK, whereas the energy barrier of its\ndissociation is high, making the response to ligand bindingweak.\nRiboswitch core\nThe flexibility of the PK enables the region closest to the PK,\nthe riboswitch core formed by the P2 and P3 helices, to fluc-\ntuate and respond to ligand binding and changes in ionconcentration. The first few PCs with the presence of\nboth ligand and Mg\n2+show that the distance between P2\nand P3 helices can be much larger than that observed inthe crystal structure (see Supplemental Movies S1 \u2013S18\nfor the PCs and Supplemental Movie S19 for the trajectory).\nThis expanding and contracting of the riboswitch core is\nmeasured by the distance between the P2 and P3 helices\n\u2014more specifically, the distance between the phosphorus\nof G34 or G35 (both on the P2 helix) and U74 (on the P3 he-\nlix). The distribution of this distance (Fig. 6) also shows that\nthe conformation of the contracted core is less populatedwith the removal of ligand or Mg\n2+. The detailed mecha-\nnism will be discussed in \u201cMechanism of ion and ligand\nregulation. \u201d\nMechanism of ion and ligand regulation\nIon concentration\nBecause every nucleotide of RNA is negatively charged,\ncations, especially Mg2+, are strongly attracted to the\nRNA phosphate backbone and less mobile than free ions.\nThus, the term \u201cion concentration \u201dis used in reference to\n\u201cbulk concentration, \u201dwhich is the concentration of ions\nin the bulk solution, where ions are considered free. For\nin vitro experiments, this effect can hardly affect the ion\nconcentration because there are many more ions thanRNA. However, because of the size of the simulation box,\nwe have a similar number of free and bound cations in the\nsimulation, and this effect needs to be taken into account.\nHere, we considered the region at least 15 \u00c5 away from\nRNA as a bulk solution for the calculation of ion concentra-\ntions. A correction, which was induced by ion interactions,was then made to this raw concentration to obtain the actu-\nal concentration (Hayes et al. 2012). The details are shown\ninSupplemental Information Section 3 .\nNext, the preferential interaction coefficient (see Supple-\nmental Information ), which is the ratio of excess ions com-\npared with bulk concentration, representing the numberof ions attracted to the RNA backbone, was calculated.\nConsistent with previous molecular dynamics studies\n(Hayes et al. 2012), it shows that the preferential interactioncoefficients of Mg\n2+are not very sensitive to the concentra-\ntion of Mg2+as long as sufficient ions are present (see dis-\ncussion in the section Global fluctuations). This is one of thereasons for obtaining similar results for our simulations at\n20 mM Mg\n2+and 5 mM Mg2+. It is also worth noticing\nthat, consistent with previous studies (Hayes et al. 2012),all the Mg\n2+in our simulations remain hydrated, whereas\nK+can dehydrate and contact with RNA directly as a result\nof the ion force field.\nIon association site and residence time\nTo investigate how Mg2+influences the fluctuations of\nRNA, we determined the Mg2+and K+association sites us-\ning a method previously reported (Hayes et al. 2012).

For a given time t0, the mean-square displacement of\na certain ion was then calculated by averaging over all pairs\nof points (Saxton 1997) with time lags t=1 ,2 ,a n d3d t(125\npsec in this study) within a 1 nsec interval counted from thegiven time. The mean-squared displacement was fitted to\n<x\n2>=6 Dtto obtain the diffusion coefficient D. The asso-\nciation site was determined by the average ion coordinatein the time interval where the diffusion coefficient dropped\nbelow 10 \u03bcm\n2/sec and rose above 100 \u03bcm2/sec. The resi-\ndence time was then calculated using the same method de-scribed previously (Hayes et al. 2012).\nThe A-form helices in the mlf-aptamer contain narrow\nand deep major grooves. And because of the coaxial stack-ing effect of the P1 helix, J31 junction, and P3 helices, a\nlong major groove is formed between the P1A (A for the\n5\n\u2032end of the helix, and B for the 3\u2032end, the same for the fol-\nlowing) and the strand containing P1B, J31, and P3B.\nBecause the major groove is narrow and the backbone\nforming it is negatively charged, cations are required tocompensate for the charges. It is shown that there are mul-\ntiple Mg\n2+association sites inside the major groove ( Sup-\nplemental Movie S19 ), with a residence time of \u223c10 nsec;\nhowever, despite the fact that there is always K+present\nin the major groove, no K+association sites can be found\nthere even in the cases where Mg2+is absent in the system\n(Fig. 7B,F). This suggests that the monovalent K+ions are\ndiffusive with much weaker interactions with the major\ngroove, which explains why the helix structure of P1 canbe distorted when Mg\n2+is absent ( Supplemental Movie\nS20). On the other hand, the residence time also reflects\nthe stability of the nearby region. With the removal of theligand, the residence time of Mg\n2+in the major groove\nslightly decreases (Fig. 7D,F), showing that the P1 helix be-\ncomes less stable under this circumstance. It can further beconfirmed that ligand binding strengthens the P1 helix\nbecause the distortion of the P1 helix in the Mg2+-free state\ncan be quickly corrected with the presence of ligand. This is\nprobably a consequence that the interaction between theupper part of the P1 helix and the junctional regions be-\ncomes stronger with a more stable ligand-binding pocket.\nThe riboswitch core formed by the P2 and P3 helices is\nalso formed by the backbone of two strands, and therefore\nalso mediated by Mg\n2+. Analysis shows that this region has\nsome of the longest-dwelling Mg2+inside (Fig. 7). In the\npresence of the 2\u2032-dG ligand, the P2 and P3 helices are\nclutched together, which further ensures the closure of\nthe pocket region. Moreover, Mg2+tends to gather around\nthe P2 and P3 helices with ligand present, while staying in\nbetween the two helices when ligand is absent. This is\nbecause the distance between the P2 and P3 helices istoo small for a hydrated Mg\n2+to fit in with a shrunk ribo-\nswitch core. The trajectory shows that the cavity of P2 and\nP3 helices has to open for a hydrated ion to pass through.However, in ligand and Mg\n2+-free state, the pocket is un-\nstable and tends to open. Unlike the major groove of the\nP1 helix which is also constrained by base-pairing andsequential adjacency, P2 and P3 helices do not have any\ncontacts other than the steric clash and ion bridge that\npull them together; thus, the instability of this region is ex-pected to serve as a driving force for the conformation re-\narrangement in the following transcription.\nThe PK region is exposed to the solvent so there is less\nconstraint for the movement of ions. Besides, the large dis-\ntance between the L2 and L3 makes it difficult for Mg\n2+to\nform an ion bridge between them. Thus, there are fewerMg\n2+association sites in the PK region and the residence\ntime of these sites is shorter. This could be the reason for\nthe large fluctuation of the PK region.TABLE 1.

SHAPE\nprobing reports on backbone flexibility\nat nucleotide resolution (Gherghe et al.\n2008), which provides insight into thelocal and global structural dynamics\nof the RNA under study.\nStability of helices\nOur SHAPE probing experiments eva-luate the stability of the structural\nelements in the riboswitch, includingthe three helices (P1, P2, and P3) un-\nder diverse solution conditions. Here,\nthe mlf-aptamer RNA is folded at\n20\u00b0C in different combinations of 2\n\u2032-\ndG and Mg2+. We find that, in the\npresence of both the 2\u2032-dG ligand\nand Mg2+, the aptamer folds into the\ncanonical structure consistent with X-\nray crystallographic studies. That is,helices P1, P2, and P3 are well formed\nand highly stable (see Fig. 9E). The\nthree-way junction (J12, J23, andJ31) is also well formed and highly sta-\nble (see Fig. 9E).\nPreviously, Wacker et al. (2011) have\nshown that the Mg\n2+facilitates ligand\nbinding by enhancing the preorganiza-\ntion of structural motifs in the free mlf-\naptamer. Our findings are consistent\nwith this observation.When comparing\nthe case of the aptamer without Mg2+\nA\nC\nED\nFB\nFIGURE 7.

We\nhave observed that in the absence of Mg2+and ligand\n(see Fig. 9B), the mlf-aptamer is not as structured, lacking\na stable P1 helix and with a much less stable three-way junc-\ntion (the three-way junction is a hallmark for the structure of\npurine riboswitches in ligand-bound states) (Mandal et al.2003; Mandal and Breaker 2004; Kim et al. 2007). Adding\n2\n\u2032-dG without Mg2+does not show an appreciable effect\nin strengthening the 3\u2032-side of helix P1 (i.e., P1B), and\ndoes not appreciably stabilize the three-way junction (al-\nthough it does help stabilize J23 somewhat). It was previous-\nly observed (Greenleaf et al. 2008) that in the apo state, helixP1 of the pbuE adenine riboswitch is not stable, but persis-\ntently forms only after ligand binding. Our analyses of the\nmlf-aptamer by SHAPE confirm that the helix P1 is unstable\nin the apo state and is stabilized in the presence of 2\n\u2032-dG and\nMg2+. The P1 helix of the purine-sensing riboswitch is con-\nsidered a key genetic regulatory element that controlsgene expression, depending on ligand binding (Mandal\net al. 2003; Mandal and Breaker 2004; Kim et al. 2007) The\n2\n\u2032-dG-dependent dynamic equilibrium of the P1 helix sup-\nports the regulatory function of the P1 helix that modulates\ndownstream gene expression. Structural investigations of\ndifferent guanine- and adenine-sensing riboswitches byNMR spectroscopy confirm that the P2 and P3 helices are\nfully or partially formed in the apo state and become more\nstructured only after ligand binding (Buck et al. 2007,\n2010; Noeske et al. 2007). The SHAPE electropherogram\nof the 2\n\u2032-dG-free and Mg2+-free conditions reveals\npartially formed structures of the P2 and P3 helices. Such nu-\ncleotide flexibility indicates that the P2 and P3 helices are\nmore flexible under 2\u2032-dG and Mg2+-depleted conditions.\nIn contrast, nucleotides in P2 and P3 helices show reduced\nSHAPE reactivity in the presence of 2\u2032-dG and Mg2+.T h i s\nobservation indicates that the P2 and P3 helices becomesignificantly more structured upon ligand binding.\nStability of the loop \u2013loop interaction\nThe Mg2+and ligand-dependent formation of a PK (loop \u2013\nloop interaction) between the L2 and L3 loops occurs in oth-er purine-sensing riboswitches. The formation of PKs in ad-\nenine and guanine-sensing riboswitches are observed in\nthe crystal structure (Serganov et al. 2004), in NMR experi-ments (Steinert et al. 2017), and in chemical probing exper-\niments (Mandal et al. 2003). Earlier studies of the adenine-\nsensing aptamer domain show that the adenine-free stateis conformationally heterogeneous, but in the presence of\nMg\n2+, is preorganized for adenine binding by forming PK in-\nteractions (Mandal and Breaker 2004). For G-box ribo-switches, nucleotides in the L2 and L3 loops also exhibit\nbasecomplementarity (Mandaletal. 2003).The crystalstruc-\nture of the mlf2\n\u2032-dG aptamer in the 2\u2032-dG bound state sug-geststhat 2\u2032-dG binding enhancesthe loop \u2013loop interaction\n(PK) through the G45 \u2013C69 and G46 \u2013C68 base pairs (Pikov-\nskaya et al. 2011). It is also observed that Mg2+enhances the\nformation of the loop \u2013loop tertiary interaction, corroborat-\ning the earlier investigation with NMR (Wacker et al. 2011).Surprisingly, in our SHAPE experiments, the nucleotides at\nL2 and L3 loop regions are found to be moderately reactive\nto highly reactive in terms of their SHAPE reactivity, which in-dicates that PKs are either not formed or highly dynamic.\nThus, the formation of PKs in the mlf-aptamer remains un-\nclear in SHAPE experiments. We note that the mlf2\n\u2032-dG\naptamer differs from the B. subtilis xpt 2\u2032-dG aptamer in\nthe length ofthe P2 and P3 helicesand inthe sequencecom-\nposition of the L2 and L3 loops (Kim et al. 2007). The lengthsof the P2 and P3 helices are 7 and 6 bp, respectively, in the\nxpt2\n\u2032-dG aptamer, whereas this pattern is reversed (6 bp in\nthe P2 helix and 7 bp in the P3 helix) in the mlf2\u2032-dG\naptamer. This change in helical length may impact the asso-\nciation of the L2 and L3 loops through PK interactions. We\nalso observe that the NMIA reactivity trend for terminalloops differs between the xptandmlfaptamers (Edwards\nand Batey 2009). L2 and L3 from mlf-aptamer are highly re-\nactive to NMIA (Kim et al. 2007), suggesting a weakened in-teraction between L2 and L3. We hypothesize that PKs are\npoorly organized in the mlf-aptamer, even in the presence\nof 2\n\u2032-dG and Mg2+, to the extent that they are not visible\non the timescale of the SHAPE experiments.\nThe architecture of the binding pocket of the mfl-aptamer\nPrevious structural analysis of the binding pocket of the gua-nine and adenine riboswitch by NMR, fluorescence, and\nchemical probing revealed a partially organized binding\npocket in which a set of nucleotides in J23 acts as a flexible\u201clid\u201dto encapsulate the ligand following its initial docking\nwith pyrimidine at J31 (Gilbert et al. 2006; Ottink et al.\n2007; Rieder et al. 2007; Stoddard et al. 2008). Like the gua-nine and adenine riboswitches, in our case, the 2\n\u2032-dG ligand\nbinds with the mfl-aptamer in the presence of Mg2+through\nthe purine riboswitch molecular recognition mode (Kim etal.2007). ITC experiments show that 2\n\u2032-dG binds the mlf-\naptamer in the presence of Mg2+(Edwards and Batey\n2009). Under similar conditions, SHAPE probing data showsthat 2\n\u2032-dG, in association with Mg2+, stabilizes the junction\nregions and subsequently forms the binding pocket (Ed-\nwards and Batey 2009). The previous crystal structure (PDBID 3SKI) indicates the sugar moiety of 2\n\u2032-dG anchors with\nG53 and A54 (G49 and A50 in our experiments) (Pikovskaya\net al. 2011). This suggests that G53 and A54 (G49 and A50 inour experiments) play a role in securing the ligand within the\npocket, leading to decreased flexibility of G53 and A54 (G49\nand A50 in our experiments) in the presence of the ligandand Mg\n2+. Similar to the previous findings (Edwards and\nBatey 2009; Pikovskaya et al. 2011), our SHAPE experi-\nments show significant structural changes, induced by theDing et al.\n1002 RNA (2024) Vol. 30, No. 8\ninteraction with 2\u2032-dG and Mg2+,o c c u rt o w a r dt h eb i n d i n g\npocket of the mlf-aptamer. This observation indicates a\nchange of the disordered binding pocket in the absence\nof 2\u2032-dG to an organized binding pocket in the presence\nof 2\u2032-dG and Mg2+. The reduced flexibility of specific nucle-\notides at the binding pocket in the presence of ligand and\nMg2+suggests their engagement in securing the ligand\nwithin the pocket. Without 2\u2032-dG, nucleotides G53 and\nA54 (G49 and A50 in our experiments) at J23 exhibit flexibil-\nity, consistent with previous NMIA chemical probing data\n(Edwards and Batey 2009).\nThexptaptamer makes the principal contact with the li-\ngand via C74 at J31 (Mandal et al. 2003). Similarly, the mlf-\naptamer anchors the ligand 2\u2032-dG through the C80 (C76\nin our experiments) nucleotide at J31 (Pikovskaya et al.\n2011). Therefore, it is expected that the interaction of the\nmlf-aptamer with 2\u2032-dG will result in a reduced SHAPE reac-\ntivity of C80 (C76 in our experiments). In our SHAPE data, an\nattenuation of the mobility of C80 (C76 in our experiments)\nis observed which supports a formation of Watson \u2013Crick\nbase pairs between 2\u2032-dG and C80 (C76 in our experiments).\nExperimental evidence shows folding and ligand\nbinding ability dependence on Mg2+\nGlobal fold and loop \u2013loop interaction\nMg2+titrations in the absence and presence of the ligand\ndemonstrate the pivotal role of Mg2+to fine-tune the stabil-\nity of structural motifs. The free RNA shows a less stable\nstructure (Figs. 8 and 9). Capillary electrophoresis dataanalysis for the 2\n\u2032-dG riboswitch shows a drastic change\nwhen the aptamer domain is allowed to fold in the pres-\nence of 5 mM Mg2+. The overall structural folding in the\npresence of 5 mM Mg2+is also supported by the related\ncrystal structure of the add adenine riboswitch (Serganov\net al. 2004). In this case, for the add adenine riboswitch,\nMg2+helps drive the aptamer domain into a competent\nconformation for ligand binding. Thus, for the addadenine\nriboswitch, the presence of Mg2+is sufficient to establish\nthe peripheral L2 \u2013L3 interactions that are observed in the\npurine riboswitch family (Mandal et al. 2003; Stoddard\net al. 2008). Previous reports indicated that the L2 \u2013L3 inter-\naction is important for ligand binding for the aptamer\ndomain of the adenine (Lemay et al. 2006) and guanine\nriboswitches (Batey et al. 2004; Ottink et al. 2007). In con-trast, our studies indicate that the loop \u2013loop interaction is\nnot a ligand-dependent phenomenon for the mfl2\n\u2032dG\naptamer. Interestingly, extensive mutational analysis per-formed by Edwards and Batey (2009) suggests the possibil-\nity of an alternate conformation between L2 and L3 other\nthan that reported for the xptRNA. The crystal structure\nof the mfl-aptamer in ligand-bound form unambiguously\nindicated the existence of a novel \u201ckey-and-lock \u201dloop mo-\ntif, which is organized by the stacking of adenine from theL3 loop into the L2 loop (Pikovskaya et al. 2011). The M. flo-\nrumclass I-A riboswitch (used in this study) differs from the\nB. subtilis xpt riboswitch in terms of the length, sequence\ncomposition of the P2 and P3 helices, and the terminal\nloops (Kim et al. 2007). We hypothesize that the adenine \u2013\nadenine base stacking interaction in the mfl-aptamer in\nthe ligand-bound state compensates for the requirement\nof a ligand-dependent terminal L2 \u2013L3 interaction.\nP1 helix\nWe first performed SHAPE experiments of the ligand-free\nmfl-aptamer RNA system. Although the P1A strand is pro-\ntected to some degree in all the conditions, the SHAPE re-\nactivity of the P1B helix indicates that the P1 helix is\nunstructured in the absence of Mg2+(Figs. 8 and 9). As\nfor the stability of the P1A strand, we speculated that, with-\nout ligand, a transient alternative helix forms between nu-\ncleotide positions 22 \u201325 (UUAU) and 31 \u201334 (GUAG), with\nthe possible involvement of C21. Interestingly, positions\nU22, U23, A33, and A34 are consistently SHAPE protected.\nThe stability of the P1 helix depends on both ligand and\nMg2+but is independent of L2 \u2013L3 tertiary interaction. In\ncontrast, for the guanine riboswitch, the structural stabilityof terminal base pairs in the P1 region in the presence of\nMg\n2+ions is cooperatively influenced by the stabilization\nof the L2 \u2013L3 interactions (Hanke and Gohlke 2017). NMR\ndata revealed that, for the pbuE adenine riboswitch, the\nformation of the P1 helix occurs only with both Mg2+and\nadenine (Nozinovic et al. 2014). Here, the loop \u2013loop inter-\naction did not inhibit the formation of the P1 helix in the WT\npbuE adenine riboswitch (Nozinovic et al. 2014). A single-\nmolecule force microscopy experiment has also suggestedthat in the apo state, the P1 helix of the pbuE adenine ribo-\nswitch is not stable on its own, but gradually forms only after\nligand binding (Greenleaf et al. 2008). Our results corrobo-rate previous observations (Gilbert et al. 2006; Greenleaf\net al. 2008; Kim et al. 2017). Our studies suggest that helix\nP1 of the mfl-aptamer is part of the regulatory switching se-\nquence, and that a ligand-dependent reversible switching\nmechanism can only be accomplished in the presence of\nMg\n2+. Previous NMR studies on the mfl-aptamer (Wacker\net al. 2011) reported dependence of P1 stability on Mg2+\nand ligand when the P1 helix is truncated (similar to the se-quence our experiments studied) and are in good agree-ment with our findings.\nP2 and P3 helices\nThe structure of the P2 and P3 helices remains at least par-tially protected in the absence of ligand or Mg\n2+(Figs. 8\nand 9). This observation suggested that both helices can\npreform in free RNA. Upon the addition of either ligandor Mg\n2+, both helices become more protected against\nthe reagent (Figs. 8 and 9).

For the P2 and P3 heli-\nces, the noncanonical hydrogen bonds are formed be-\ntween the two helical strands, preventing the helices fromfully dissociating. For the P1 helix and the PK, on the con-\ntrary, the structural motifs separated in sequence (e.g.,\nP1A and P1B for the P1 helix, L2 and L3 for the PK). The dis-tal regions dissociate and hydrogen bonds are formed in-\nside of the single motifs. On the one hand, the higher\ntemperature study demonstrates how the RNA system canlower its free energy by forming substitute hydrogen bonds\nat high temperature, making a compromise between the in-\nternal energy and entropic contributions to the free energy.The high-temperature study also demonstrates that the P2\nand P3 helix have a higher stability, even though the P1 and\nP3 helices can show similar timescales of melting possiblyattributed to the coaxial stacking effect.\nConclusions\nThe aptamer domain of the 2\u2032-dG mlfriboswitch ( mfl-\naptamer) is responsible for the ligand-binding process nec-essary for modulating transcription regulation. We have\nquantitatively studied, from the perspectives of both com-\nputation and experiment, the interplay between Mg2+, li-\ngand binding, and thermal stability on the structural\nscaffold, including the helices, junctions, and the PK, which\nis involved in this transition. Detailed analysis of these pro-cesses suggests the requirement of both ligand and Mg\n2+\nfor the stabilization of the mfl-aptamer (necessary for the\nOFF state). Our studies provide a general mechanism forconformational changes of the P1 helix and consequent lo-\ncal melting. This melting, undoubtedly affected by the cou-\npling effect of ligand and Mg\n2+binding, is needed to\nregulate the formation of the expression platform and\ntherefore transcription in the purine riboswitch family.\nSimulations at room temperature show that the likeli-\nhood of breaking hydrogen bonds is larger for the P1 helix\ncompared with the P2 and P3 helices, especially in the ab-\nsence of Mg2+or ligand. Simulations at 400 K, performed\nto amplify these differences in short simulations, also sug-\ngest a more compact structure for the P2 and P3 helices.\nThis is in qualitative agreement with the SHAPE experi-ments. These experiments also suggest that P1 is the least\nstable helix at all conditions, particularly with the removal of\neither Mg\n2+or ligand (Fig. 9). Both experimental and simu-\nlation methods suggest that the three-way junction (the\npocket of ligand binding) is disordered in the absence of li-\ngand in both Mg2+concentrations along with the P1 helixA\nB\nFIGURE 10. Regional stability at 400 K for ( A) 0 mM Mg2+, dG[\u2212] and ( B) 5 mM Mg2+, dG[\u2212]. From lefttoright , the number of native hydrogen\nbonds formed in the region, the total number of hydrogen bonds formed in the region (both scaled by the number of native hydrogen bonds),\nand regional RMSD with the entire structure fit first (same as before). The native helices and PK melt in both cases giving a large deviation from\nthe native structure of \u223c15 \u00c5; however, the variety of hydrogen bonds donor and acceptor in nucleic acid makes it possible for the RNA motifs\nto form nonnative hydrogen bonds as compensation and lower the energy. As shown in the first column, the number of hydrogen bond caneven exceed the original number, and these newly formed hydrogen bonds can either be between the submotifs and collapse the structure, or\ninside the strand which makes the single strand curly.Ding et al.\n1006 RNA (2024) Vol. 30, No. 8\n(Figs. 4 and 9), suggesting a possible dynamical coupling\nbetween these two regions.\nSimulations also show that the stabilities for P2 and P3\nhelices are similar (Fig. 4; Supplemental Fig. S6 ) and the ki-\nnetic runs at higher temperature have shown that Mg2+\nstrengthens these helices (Fig. 10). Both findings are sup-\nported qualitatively by the SHAPE reactivity profiles.\nHowever, further studies are needed to establish morecommensurate measures to help determine the underlying\nminor discrepancies between simulations and experiments\nand the conformational ensemble of the aptamer domainin the ligand-free state.\nThe explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations\n(Figs. 4 and 5C,D), SHAPE experiments (Fig. 9), and previ-ous in-line probing experiments (Kim et al. 2007) show that\nthe mobility of the PK region is weakly sensitive to ligand\nbinding. The simulations suggest an explanation for thisphenomenon. The energy landscape of the PK is relatively\nflat compared with the energy barrier between L2 and L3\nbecause of the large contacting surface area that allowsnonnative hydrogen bond formation. On the other hand,\nthis flat energy landscape allows the PK to break and reor-\nganize its contacts, making the PK simultaneously less sen-sitive to environmental changes while being sensitive to\nthermal fluctuations.\nIn the absence of ligand, the elongation of the mRNA\nand the formation of the expression platform are a conse-\nquence of the breaking of the P1 helix accompanied by\nthe formation of a new helix (antiterminator) that combines\npart of the P1 helix and part of the expression platform. This\nis the mechanism for switching the riboswitch to the ONstate (Helmling et al. 2018). We postulate that this confor-\nmation change is facilitated by the flexible PK. Ligand bind-\ning also results in key configurational entropy changes inthe flexible junction region and dynamic separation be-\ntween P2 and P3, which may help to facilitate the dynamics\nof P1.\nThe ligand plays an essential role in this process because\nthe absence of the 2\n\u2032-dG molecule releases the restraints on\nthe P1 helix, the pocket region, and the riboswitch core, cre-ating extra local minima in the energy landscape, which\nleads to a potential pathway for breaking up the P1 helix.\nAlthough the mfl-aptamer is preorganized without\nMg\n2+, a decrease in Mg2+concentration also helps facili-\ntate the process of conformation change of the aptamer\ndomain. Removing Mg2+from certain binding sites ampli-\nfies the frustration of the system, especially between nega-\ntively charged backbone strands, thus reducing the free\nenergy barrier to escape from the native basin. The essen-tial dynamics of P1 helix fluctuations and riboswitch core\nbreathing are both Mg\n2+-dependent, both involving the\nseparation of two strands. It should be mentioned thatthese two types of fluctuations are also strongly influenced\nby ligand binding, unraveling a cooperative stabilization ef-\nfect of ligand and Mg\n2+.MATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe have used both simulation and experimental methods to\nstudy the aptamer domain of 2\u2032-dG riboswitch from M. forum\n(mlf-aptamer). The detailed procedures are described below.\nExplicit-solvent all-atom simulation\nThe simulation protocols and parameters follow our previous\nstudies (Hayes et al. 2012) and are described in detail below.The simulations use the GROMACS package (Abraham et al.2015), v2019 and v2021. We have shown that both versionsproduce similar results ( Supplemental Fig. S2 ). The AMBER 99\nforcefield (Wang et al. 2000) was used with modified K\n+van der\nWaals parameters (Dang 1995) and SPC/E water, as in ourprevious study (Hayes et al. 2012).\nThe system with and without ligand was placed in a 100 \u00c5 box of\nwater with 100 mM KCl, and MgCl\n2concentrations of 0, 5, and 20\nmM, providing six conditions in total. The RNA backbone is neg-atively charged, attracting extra K\n+and Mg2+and making these\nions less mobile. Thus, the ion concentrations are computedfrom the concentration of free ions (bulk concentration). The num-bers of ions required to produce the desired bulk concentrationswere determined iteratively repeating the equilibration processwith different numbers of ions to achieve the desired values ofbulk concentrations. Details are further discussed in the sectionIon concentration.\nEquilibration\nFor each condition, equilibration started with the crystal structureof ligand-bound mfl-aptamer (PDB code: 3SKI) (Pikovskaya et al.\n2011). For ligand-absent simulations, the ligand was removed.First, the RNA molecule (and ligand, if present) was frozen withno solvent added; ions were placed throughout the box randomlywith their van der Waals radius and energy parameters modified tomimic the metal aquo complex; and different parameter sets forthe metal aquo complex were tested and produced similar results(Supplemental Fig. S3 ). The system was then equilibrated at cons-\ntant volume at 300 K for 8 nsec, with stochastic dynamics and a di-electric constant of 80 to mimic water, producing a distribution ofions electrostatically equilibrated throughout the box. Next, thesystem was solvated with explicit water, and water moleculeswere equilibrated at constant volume at 300 K for 200 psec withall other species frozen. Ions were then set free and equilibratedin the same condition for another 4 nsec. RNA (and ligand, ifpresent) was then gradually released with position restraints of1000, 100, 10, 1, and 0 kcal/mol/nm\n2. Each equilibration lasts\nfor 2 nsec at 300 K and constant pressure. For production simula-tions, the entire system was free of restraints.\nRoom-temperature simulations\nFor each condition, eight parallel free explicit-solvent simulationswere performed without any restraints at constant volume at 300 Kfor each condition, starting with the equilibrated system. All thesimulations were performed for 2 \u00b5sec, providing an aggregatesampling of 16 \u00b5sec in total for each condition, amounting to a to-tal of 96 \u00b5sec total room temperature production sampling.Landscape of mRNA elements\nwww.rnajournal.org 1007\nHigh-temperature simulations\nFor conditions of 0 and 5 mM Mg2+, without ligand, a higher tem-\nperature of 400 K was also simulated. These simulations at hightemperatures magnify the fluctuations of the system, providing areference for the stability of different regions of the system(Sarkar et al. 2021). High-temperature simulations started withthe equilibrated system at 300 K, which was heated to 400 K dur-ing 25 nsec at constant volume. The final states were then used torun two parallel simulations of 1.5 \u00b5sec.\nIn vitro transcription of the mlf-aptamer\nThe sequence corresponding to mlf-aptamer is placed in the cen-\nter of an RNA structure cassette to facilitate analysis of 2\u2032-O-adduct\nformation by the chemical probing reaction. Surrounding se-quence stretches are required for any set of SHAPE experimentsfor the primer extension by reverse transcription. In particular,the SHAPE method requires an additional sequence beyond theaptamer to allow binding of the polymerase, necessary for readoutof the SHAPE reactivity. Usually, it is challenging to quantify the10\u201320 nt near the primer binding site. This difficulty arises\nbecause cDNA fragments, reflecting pauses by the reverse tran-scriptase enzyme during the primer extension \u2019s initiation phase,\nare present. Additionally, the 8 \u201310 positions at the 5\n\u2032end of the\nRNA remain inconclusive because of the intense signal corre-sponding to the full-length extension product. To clearly observeSHAPE reactivities at the 5\n\u2032and 3\u2032ends of a specific RNA se-\nquence, we have placed the RNA sequence of interest within op-timized 5\n\u2032and 3\u2032structure cassettes. This design enables clearer\nevaluation of all positions within the RNA sequence of interest us-ing capillary electrophoresis.\nEach helix in the cassette contains a stable UUCG tetraloop to\nenforce the designed fold (of the cassette) and eliminate interfer-ence with the RNA sequence of interest. The sequence of the DNAconstruct for current studies is given below:\nGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATA GGGCCTTCGGGCCAAAG\nAA\nACTTATACAGGGTAGCATAATGGGCTACTGACCCCGCCTT\nCAAACCTATTTGGAGACTATAAGTGAAAA CCGATCCGCTTCG\nGCGGATCCAAATTGGGCTTCGGTTCGGTTCGATAA ,w h e r er e d\nis the T7 promoter, magenta is the 5\u2032structure cassette, black is\nthemlf-aptamer sequence, and blue is the 3\u2032structure cassette.\nA linear DNA template containing the mlf-aptamer sequence\nwith the RNA structure cassette was procured as a gBlock (IDT).The gBlock is subjected to amplification using OneTaq DNAPolymerase (Takara), and the resulting DNA template is tran-\nscribed in vitro using a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit\n(NEB) with the manufacturer \u2019s protocol. The transcribed RNA is\npurified by the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB). The purity ofmlf-aptamer RNA is assessed by an 8% Urea PAGE. The concentra-\ntion of mlf-aptamer RNA is determined using extinction coefficient\n1405.4 mM\n\u22121cm\u22121(calculated using the server https://www\n.fechem.uzh.ch/MT/links/ext.html).\nChemical probing\n1M7 (SHAPE reagent) is synthesized as described previously(Mortimer and Weeks 2007). Thirty picomoles of mlf-aptamer\nRNA is thermally denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by imme-diately cooling on ice for 2 min. 10\u00d7 buffer (500 mM Na-HEPES,pH8.0, 1 M KCl, either with 5 mM MgCl\n2or without MgCl 2) is add-\ned to the RNA (final concentration of buffer is adjusted to 1\u00d7 in100 \u03bcL reaction mixture) in the absence and presence of 20 \u03bcM\nof 2\n\u2032-dG (Sigma). The RNA (\u00b12\u2032-dG) is incubated at 20\u00b0C to\nequilibrate. A solution of 1M7 in anhydrous DMSO or neatDMSO (for blank only) is then added to the tubes (final concentra-tion of 1M7 is adjusted to 3 mM) followed by incubation at 20\u00b0Cfor 10 min. Immediately after modification, the modified RNA isprecipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of 100% cold ethanol,1/10th volume 3 M sodium acetate, and 25 \u03bcg glycogen\n(Thermo Fisher), followed by centrifugation.\nPrimer extension\nThe RNA pellet is resuspended in 7.75 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water.\nOne microliter of 1.5 \u03bcM (1.5 pmol, total) of 5\u2032-Alexa-488 labeled\nUniRev primer is mixed with the RNA, followed by incubationat 65\u00b0C for 1 min, 45\u00b0C for 5 min, and finally placed on ice for1 min. Primer extension mix is supplemented by 500 \u03bcMo fe a c h\nof the dNTPs, 10 mM DTT, 1\u00d7 SSIII FS buffer, and 200 U/ \u03bcLo f\nSuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). A 15 \u03bcL primer\nextension reaction is initiated by incubating the mixture at 55\u00b0Cfor 1.25 h. A-sequencing reactions are identically performed onunmodified RNA. Only for sequencing reactions, the primer ex-tension mix is supplemented with 333 \u03bcM ddTTP. Primer exten-\nsion reactions are desalted by spinning in the P-6 micro-biospincolumn (Bio-Rad).\nData collection and processing\nEach sample is then diluted in deionized formamide in a 1:20 ratio(by volume) and heated to 95\u00b0C for 3 \u20134 min. The samples are elec-\ntrokinetically injected (30 sec at 6 kV) onto an ABI Prism 3100-Avant quad-capillary instrument. A fluorescence electrophero-gram is then collected at 14 kV. Each electrogram is processedas per the protocol reported earlier (Hennelly et al. 2013).Briefly, each data set is aligned and integrated using in-house soft-ware for the simultaneous fitting of multiple Gaussian peaks to thetraces. Area under the peak corresponding to each nucleotide isassigned by dideoxy-sequencing data. The integrated area for in-\ndividual nucleotides corresponding to the blank sample (RNA\ntreated with neat DMSO) is then subtracted from SHAPE data(1M7 treated). To normalize the areas, the first 10% of the data cor-responding to the highest reactivity values are considered outliersand are excluded. From the remaining data (areas), 10% of highlyreactive nucleotides are averaged to calculate a normalization fac-tor. The entire profile, including the previously excluded outliers,is then normalized by that factor.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL\nSupplemental material is available for this article.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge generous support from the National Institutesof Health (NIH) (RO1-GM110310 to J.N.O., RO1-GM110310 toK.Y.S.).

Erdong Ding\nis the first author of this paper, \u201cMagnesium ions mitigate meta-\nstable states in the regulatory landscape of mRNA elements. \u201d\nErdong is currently a PhD candidate in Professor Jos\u00e9 Onuchic \u2019s\ngroup at the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics at RiceUniversity. He is working on both explicit-solvent and coarse-\ngrained molecular dynamics simulation for riboswitch systems.\nWhat are the major results described in your paper and how do\nthey impact this branch of the field?\nWe examined the 2\n\u2032-dG riboswitch, a less-studied member of the\npurine-sensing riboswitch family, with both experiments and simu-\nlation tools. We have verified the well-known stability order of thehelices in this riboswitch family that the regulatory helix would bethe least stable but also worked out the mechanism of how ligand\nbinding and Mg\n2+affect the stability of the helices at the molecular\nlevel. This would in general help the community to better under-\nstand the conformation change of different riboswitch regulatoryhelices.\nWhat led you to study RNA or this aspect of RNA science?\nIt is always fascinating to see how powerful hydrogen bonds and\nvan der Waals forces can be and how they have curved large bio-molecules like protein and RNA. While the protein folding problem\nhas been well-tackled with the energy landscape theory, RNA fold-\ning is much more complicated, as the molecules are much moredynamic, and their energy landscape may deviate a lot from aperfect funnel or even be rugged. This makes RNA structures funto study from the perspective of both thermodynamics and\nkinetics.\nWhat are some of the landmark moments that provoked your\ninterest in science or your development as a scientist?\nBack in middle school when I was first exposed to chemistry cours-\nes, I got confused by how qualitative everything seemed to be inthe field, and I believed there was much to learn and to do with\nregard to it. This has encouraged me on a path of physical chem-\nistry and computational chemistry in college and in grad school.\nIf you were able to give one piece of advice to your younger self,\nwhat would that be?\nIn science: Read more papers and ask more questions.\nIn general: Be decisive, you have thrown away too many shots.Ding et al.\n1010 RNA (2024) Vol. 30, No. 8\n"}
