Allosteric  \nactivators  are often metabolites  but other molecules  serve similar functions.  So far, examples  of long non-coding  RNAs (lncRNAs)  acting as \nallosteric  activators  of enzyme  activity are missing.  Here, we describe  the function  of mitolnc  in cardiom  y ocytes,  a nuclear  encoded  long non- \ncoding RNA, located  in mitochondria  and directly  interacting  with the branc hed-c hain k etoacid  deh y drogenase  (BCKDH)  comple  x to increase  \nits activity.  The BCKDH  complex  is critical for branc hed-c hain amino acid catabolism  (BCAAs).  Inactivation  of mitolnc  in mice reduces  BCKDH  \ncomplex  activity,  resulting  in accumulation  of BCAAs  in the heart and cardiac h ypertroph  y via enhanced  mTOR signaling.  We found that mitolnc  \nallosterically  activates  the BCKDH  complex,  independent  of phosphorylation.  Mitolnc-mediated  regulation  of the BCKDH  complex  constitutes  \nan important  additional  la y er to regulate  the BCKDH  complex  in a tissue-specific  manner,  e v ading direct coupling  of BCAA metabolism  to ACLY- \ndependent  lipogenesis.  \nGr aphical  abstr act \nIntroduction  \nThe essential  branched  chain amino  acids (BCAAs)  valine,  \nleucine  and isoleucine  are important  building  blocks  of life, \ncontributing  to protein  synthesis.  Moreover,  BCAAs  and some \nof their products  serve as signaling  molecules,  regulating  pro- \ntein synthesis,  insulin  secretion  and other processes.  Del- \nicate changes  in BCAA  metabolism  are assumed  to con- \ntribute  to heart failure  and several  other widespread  dis- \neases ( 1 ). The first steps of BCAA  catabolism  are common  \nfor all three BCAAs  and consist  of a reversible  transamina-  \ntion and a virtually  irreversible  oxidative  decarboxylation.  \nReversible  transamination  is achieved  by BCAA  aminotrans-  \nferases  (BCATs)  that transfer  the amino  group of BCAAs  to \u03b1- \nketoglutarate,  generating  branched-chain  ketoacids  (BCKAs).  BCAT1  is localized  in the cytosol  and BCAT2  is localized  at \nthe inner membrane  of the mitochondria  where it forms a tem- \nporary  structural-functional  complex,  a metabolon,  with the \nbranched  chain ketoacid  dehydrogenase  complex  (BCKDH  \ncomplex),  which mediates  the second,  rate-limiting  step of ir- \nreversible  oxidative  decarboxylation.  The BCKDH  complex  \nconsists  of the three components  E1, E2 and E3. The E1 \ncomponent  is a thiamine-dependent  decarboxylase,  contain-  \ning BCKDHA  and BCKDHB  heterotetramers.  The E2 compo-  \nnent is DBT, a dihydrolipoyl  transacylase  mediating  the trans- \nfer of the acyl group to coenzyme  A. The E3 component  is \nDLD , an F AD-dependent  dihydrolipoyl  dehydrogenase  medi- \nating the transfer  of electrons  to NAD + . Subsequent  process-  \ning of the branched  chain acyl-CoAs  diverges  according  to the \nReceived:  August 24, 2023. Revised:  March 12, 2024. Editorial  Decision:  March 14, 2024.

Mutation  of the BCKDH  com- \nplex subunits  result in maple syrup urine disease  (MSUD),  \ncharacterized  by toxic levels of free BCAAs  and their corre- \nsponding  BCKAs.  MSUD  may result in ketoacidosis  and se- \nvere neurological  disease  and regularly  leads to death if left \nuntreated  ( 2 ,3 ). \nOxidative  decarboxylation  by the BCKDH  complex  is \ntightly  controlled  by phosphorylation  of the E1 subunit  BCK- \nDHA at serine 293. Phosphorylation  by BCKDH  kinase  \n(BDK)  ( 4 ) results  in inactivation  of the BCKDH  complex  \nwhile PPM1K  is the corresponding  phosphatase  activating  \nthe BCKDH  complex  ( 5 ,6 ). BDK is allosterically  inhibited  by \nbranched-chain  ketoacids,  creating  a positive  feedback  loop. \nInterestingly,  BDK and PPM1K  also have essential  roles in \nlipid metabolism  by regulating  the activity  of ATP-citrate  \nlyase (ACLY),  which catalyzes  the conversion  of citrate  to \nacetyl-CoA  and oxaloacetate,  thereby  promoting  lipogenesis  \nand reducing  fatty acid oxidation  ( 7 ,8 ). BDK activates  ACLY \nby phosphorylation  at serine 454 and dephosphorylation  by \nPPM1K  inhibits  ACLY,  integrating  BCAAs  catabolism  with li- \npogenesis  ( 9 ,10 ). \nThe BCAA  leucine  has well described  anabolic  effects  ( 11 ), \nachieved  by stimulation  of mTOR  signaling  via different  \nmechanisms.  Leucine  is sensed  by Sestrin1  / 2 and activates  \nmT OR signals  via GAT OR2 / 1-RA G ( 12 , 13 ). Leucine  might \nalso be sensed  by the SLC38A9-RAG-Ragulator  complex  at \nthe lysosomal  surface  to activate  mTOR  via Rheb ( 14 ,15 ). Al- \nternatively,  leucine  concentration  might also be detected  by \nthe leucyl tRNA synthetase  1 (LARS1)  ( 16 ), whose  activity  is \nglucose-dependent  ( 17 ), illustrating  the complexity  of regula-  \ntory networks  involving  leucine.  Another  important  signaling  \neffect of leucine  is the allosteric  activation  of glutamate  dehy- \ndrogenase  (GDH)  ( 18 ,19 ), yielding  \u03b1-ketoglutarate.  \nLong non-coding  RNAs (lncRNAs)  have not been assumed  \nto play a direct role in the regulation  of BCAA  metabolism  so \nfar. LncRNAs  are longer  than 200 nucleotides,  are not trans- \nlated into functional  proteins,  usually  show a very poor con- \nservation  of their primary  sequences  during  evolution,  and are \ngenerated  by widespread  transcription  of genomes,  resulting  \nin a highly heterogeneous  group of transcripts  with differ- \nent biogenesis  and genomic  origin.  Current  estimates  range \nfrom 16 000 to 100 000 lncRNA  genes in the human  genome  \n( 20 ,21 ). An increasing  number  of functional  studies  indicate  \nthe importance  of lncRNAs  for the regulation  of multiple  cel- \nlular processes.  In many cases, lncRNAs  regulate  chromatin  \nactivity,  often in cis , next to lncRNA-expressing  loci ( 22 ,23 ) \nor in trans within  the nucleus  to activate  and repress  gene ac- \ntivity ( 24 ). Moreover,  several  lncRNAs  are exported  to the \ncytosol,  probably  sharing  the same pathways  with mRNAs.  \nSome lncRNAs  are sorted into mitochondria  such as the RNA \ncomponent  of mitochondrial  RNA-processing  endoribonucle-  \nase (RMRP),  which is bound  and stabilized  by the G-rich  RNA \nsequence-binding  factor 1 (GRSF1),  enabling  enrichment  in \nthe mitochondrial  matrix  ( 25 ). However,  only limited  insight  \nexists regarding  the physiological  function  of lncRNAs,  which \nare limited  to in vitro studies  in melanoma  cells, fibroblasts  \nand macrophages  ( 25\u201329  ). \nIn this study, we investigate  the physiological  roles of \ncardiac-restricted  and nucleus-encoded  lncRNAs  that are \ntransferred  into mitochondria.  We identified  a lncRNA  \n(AK079912)  that we named  mitolnc,  which interacts  with the \nBCKDH  complex  in the mitochondrial  matrix  and allosteri-  \ncally regulates  its activity.  Inactivation  of mitolnc  reduces  ac- tivity of the BCKDH  complex  and results  in accumulation  of \nBCAAs  in the adult heart, which enhances  mTOR  signaling  \nand induces  cardiac  hypertrophy.  Mitolnc-dependent  control  \nof the BCKDH  complex  circumvents  phosphorylation-based  \nregulation  by BDK and PPM1K,  thereby  uncoupling  BCAA  \ncatabolism  from fatty acid metabolism  in the heart. \nMaterials  and methods  \nAnimal  models  \nTwo pairs of sgRNAs  were used in a double  nicking  ap- \nproach  ( 30 ) to direct hSpCas9n  (D10A)  expressed  from a \nmodified  pX335  vector (addgene  #42335)  carrying  an addi- \ntional EF1a-copGFP-T2A-Puromycin  R cassette.  Pairs of sgR- \nNAs were designed  to target sequences  5 /prime (guide sequences:  \np894: GGA TGAAA  TTT ACTTT  AAGT,  p895: gCCA TGCAA-  \nGA GAAAA  CTC AT) and 3 /prime (p898:  GTGC  AC AATAGTTTTG-  \nGTTT,  p899: GT ACCT  AAAGCCCTGGGTGA)  of the ge- \nnomic locus of AK079912.  The four px335-derived  plasmids  \ncontaining  the respective  U6-driven  sgRNAs  were transfected  \ninto mouse  embryonic  stem cells using Lipofectamine\u2122 3000  \n(Thermo  Fisher #L3000001)  followed  by puromycin  selection  \n(2 \u03bcg / \u03bcl, 1 day after transfection  for 2 days) to obtain  mu- \ntant clones that were detected  by PCR using oligonucleotides.  \nAll oligonucleotide  sequences  used in this study are listed in \nSupplementary  Table S1 . \nFor an alternative  loss of function  model,  a poly A \nsite was inserted  into the first exon of AK079912  using \nthe px459  pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro  vector (pSpCas9(BB)-  \n2A-Puro  (PX459)  V2.0 was a gift from Feng Zhang  \n(Addgene  plasmid  #62988;  http:// n2t.net/  addgene:62988;  \nRRID:A  ddgene_62988)  ( 31 ).

Clones  with recombinant  alleles were identified  by PCR \nusing oligonucleotides  listed in Supplementary  Table S1 . Am- \nplicons  were sequenced  to identify  correctly  targeted  clones.  \nChimeric  mice were generated  by injection  of embryonic  stem \ncells into blastocysts,  chimeras  were backcrossed  to 129SV  \nmice and heterozygous  mice were mated to obtain  mitolnc  \u2212/ \u2212\nor mitolnc  pA / pA mice and the respective  WT mice. High \nBCAA  diet was obtained  from Sniff ( www.sniff.com  , S7507-  \nE054, 4.3% BCAA;  Crystalline  AA diet). Mice were fed ad \nlibitum  for 8 weeks.  Encapsulated  Rapamycin  was obtained  \nfrom Rapamycin  Holdings  ( www.rapamycinholdings.com  ) \nto produce  14 ppm active rapamycin  supplemented  diet and \nrespective  control  diet containing  the rapamycin  vehicle  Eu- \ndragit by Envigo\u2014Teklad  Diets (TD.160060  based on 2018 \nTeklad  Global  18% Protein  Rodent  Diet, www.envigo.com  ). \nMice were fed ad libitum  for 8 weeks.  If not otherwise  stated \nmice were kept in IVC with ad libitum  access to water and \nfood. All animal  experiments  were done in accordance  with \nnational  and European  community  guidelines  and were ap- \nproved  by the Committee  for Animal  Protection  of the State \nof Hessen  (Regierungspraesidium  Darmstadt).  \nNucleic  Acids Research  , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 11 6631 \nBCAA  serum  concentration  \nTo analyze  BCAA  levels in blood serum we sacrificed  the mice \nvia decapitation  and collected  the blood.

BCAA  levels \nof serum samples  were obtained  by using the branched  chain \namino  acid assay kit from abcam  (#ab83374)  according  to \nmanufacturer\u2019s  specifications.  \nIsolation  of mouse  cardiomyocytes  \nAnimals  were sacrificed  via i.p. injections  of 100 \u03bcl / 10 g \nbodyweight  Ketamin  / Xylariem  (4 ml NaCl 0.9%, 0.5 ml Ke- \ntamin,  0.25 ml Xylariem).  Hearts  were collected  and washed  \nand perfused  with perfusion  buffer (NaCl 113 mM, KCl \n4.7 mM, Na 2 HPO 4 0.6 mM, KH 2 PO 4 0.6 mM, MgSO  4 \n1.2 mM, NaHCO  3 12 mM, KHCO  3 10 mM, taurine  30 \nmM, HEPES  10 mM, 2,3-butanedione  monoxime  10 mM, \nglucose  5.5 mM). Cells were digested  via perfusion  of the \nhearts with enzyme  buffer (perfusion  buffer,  Liberase  DH \n0.25 mg / ml (Roche  #05401089001),  Trypsin  0.27 mg / ml \n(Sigma  #T7409),  CaCl 2 23.2 \u03bcM). The enzymatic  reaction  \nwas stopped  by adding  Stop buffer (perfusion  buffer,  FCS 5%, \nCaCl 2 12.5 \u03bcM). \nIsolation  of nuclei  and cytoplasm  \nFor isolation  of nuclei and cytoplasm,  mouse  cardiomyocytes  \nwere isolated  and washed  with ice-cold  PBS pH 7.4. Samples  \nwere centrifuged  (1000 \u00d7g, 10 min at 4 \u25e6C) and the pellet \nre-suspended  in 100 \u03bcl Buffer A (10 mM Tris / HCl pH 8.0, \n140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5% Nonidet  P-40). Samples  \nwere incubated  on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged  (1000 \n\u00d7g, 3 min at 4 \u25e6C). The supernatant,  containing  the extranu-  \nclear fraction  was collected  and mixed with 700 \u03bcl Trizol for \nRNA isolation.  The pellet was washed  twice using Buffer A \nand then re-suspended  in Buffer B (Buffer  A + 1% Tween-40,  \n0.5% sodium  deoxycholate)  followed  by another  centrifuga-  \ntion for 5 min. The pellet containing  the nuclear  fraction  was \nre-suspended  in 700 \u03bcl Trizol for RNA isolation.  \nIsolation  of mitochondria  \nMitochondrial  isolation  was performed  as described  previ- \nously ( 32 ,33 ). In brief, mice were sacrificed  by cervical  dis- \nlocation  and perfused  with PBS. Hearts  were transferred  into \nPBD (1 \u00d7PBS pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA)  and minced  using a \npair of scissors.  The tissue was washed  twice with PBD and \nthen incubated  with PBD-T  (PBD, 0.05%  Trypsin)  on ice for \n30 min. The samples  were centrifuged  at 200 \u00d7g for 5 min \nat 4 \u25e6C. The pellet was resuspended  in 5 ml IBM 1 pH 7.4 (6.7 \nml Sucrose  (1 M), 5 ml Tris / HCl (1 M), 5 ml KCl (1 M), 2 \nml BSA (10%)  ad. 100 ml ddH 2 O). Samples  were homoge-  \nnized using a potter homogenizer  (10 strokes  at 1600 rpm). \nThe homogenate  was centrifuged  (700 \u00d7g, 10 min at 4 \u25e6C). \nThe pellet (cell debris)  was used as heart / rest fraction  in the \ndownstream  analysis.  The supernatant  containing  the mito- \nchondria  was transferred  into glass centrifugation  tubes fol- \nlowed by centrifugation  (8000 \u00d7g, 10 min at 4 \u25e6C). The su- \npernatant  was removed,  and the pellet was re-suspended  in 5 \nml IBM 2 pH 7.4 (25 ml Sucrose  (1 M), 3 ml EGTA / Tris (1 \nM), 1 ml Tris / HCl (1 M) ad. 100 ml ddH 2 O) followed  by \ncentrifugation  (8000 \u00d7g, 10 min at 4 \u25e6C) and resuspension  of \nthe pellet in an equal volume  of IBM 2 . For RNA isolation,  samples  were further  treated  with 1 \n\u03bcl Digitonin  (Sigma  #D141,  10 mg / ml) and 0.5 \u03bcl RNase  A \n(Merck  #20297,  10 mg / ml). Samples  were incubated  for 20 \nmin at 27 \u25e6C. Afterwards  samples  were centrifuged  at 11 000 \n\u00d7g for 5 min at 4 \u25e6C. The pellet containing  the mitochondria  \nwas re-suspended  in 700 \u03bcl TRIzol  and RNA isolation  was \nperformed  using RNeasy  Mini Kit (Qiagen  #217004)  com- \nbined with on-column  DNase  digestion  (RNase-Free  DNase  \nSet, Qiagen  #79254)  according  to manufacturer\u2019s  instruction.  \nQuantification  of cardiomyocytes  cross sectional  \narea \nCryosections  of heart tissue were used to determine  cardiomy-  \nocytes cross sectional  area. Hearts  were collected  after cervi- \ncal dislocation  of animals,  were fixed using 4% PFA / PBS (2 h, \n4 \u25e6C) and transferred  to 15% sucrose  / PBS, 30% sucrose  / PBS \nand Tissue-Tek\u00ae O.C.T  Compound  (94-4583-1;  each step \novernight,  4 \u25e6C). Cryosections  (10 \u03bcm) were prepared  using a \nLeica CM1950,  dried (30 min, 21 \u25e6C) and fixed (4% PFA, 10 \nmin, 21 \u25e6C). Slides were incubated  in 0.1% Triton X-100  / PBS \n(10 min, 21 \u25e6C) and washed  three times using PBS (5 min each). \nSamples  were stained  using wheat germ agglutinin  (WGA-  \n488, Thermo  #W11261,  1 mg / ml, 1:500 in carrier  contain-  \ning 5% goat serum,  2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100  in PBS; \n1 h, 21 \u25e6C). Sections  were incubated  using DAPI (Invitrogen  \n#D3571,  2 mg / ml, 1:1000  in PBS, 5 min 21 \u25e6C), washed  three \ntimes (PBS, 5 min each), embedded  using Fluoromount  (Sigma  \n#F4680)  and microscopic  images  were acquired  using an Axio \nObserver  (Zeiss).  Cross sectional  area of cardiomyocytes  was \ndetermined  using blinded  samples  and manual  segmentation  \nin ImageJ.  Numerical  binning  of cross sectional  area was used \nfor statistical  analysis.  \nRNA seq, Affymetrix  microarrays  and RT-qPCR  \nFor RNA-seq,  RNA was isolated  from isolated  mitochondria  \nusing TRIzol\u2122 (Thermo  Scientific  #15596026)  according  to \nthe manufacturer\u2019s  instruction,  followed  by miRNeasy  mini \nKit (Qiagen  #217004)  combined  with on-column  DNase  di- \ngestion  (RNase-Free  DNase  Set, Qiagen  #79254).  RNA and \nlibrary  preparation  integrity  were verified  with LabChip  Gx \nTouch 24 (Perkin  Elmer).  10 ng of total RNA was used as in- \nput for SMARTer\u00ae Stranded  Total RNA-Seq  Kit\u2014Pico  Input \nMammalian  (Takara  Clontech).  Fragmentation  time of mito- \nchondrial  samples  was adjusted  to 1 min according  to size \nof RNA. Sequencing  was performed  using the NextSeq500  \ninstrument  (Illumina)  using v2 chemistry,  generating  a min- \nimum of 40M reads per library  with 1 \u00d775 bp single end \nsetup. The resulting  raw reads were assessed  for quality,  \nadapter  content  and duplication  rates with FastQC  ( http:// \nwww.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/  projects/  fastqc ). Trim- \nmomatic  version  0.39 was employed  to trim reads after a \nquality  drop below a mean of Q20 in a window  of 5 nu- \ncleotides  ( 34 ). Only reads between  30 and 150 nucleotides  \nwere cleared  for further  analyses.  Trimmed  and filtered  reads \nwere aligned  versus the Ensembl  mouse  genome  version  \nmm10  (GRCm38.p5)  using STAR 2.7.3a  with the parame-  \nter \u2018\u2013outFilterMismatchNoverLmax  0.1\u2019 to increase  the max- \nimum ratio of mismatches  to mapped  length to 10% ( 35 ). \nThe number  of reads aligning  to genes was counted  with fea- \ntureCounts  tool from the Subread  package  1.6.5 ( 36 ). Only \nreads mapping  at least partially  inside exons were admitted  \nand aggregated  per gene. Reads overlapping  multiple  genes \n6632 Nucleic  Acids Research  , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 11 \nor aligning  to multiple  regions  were excluded.  Differentially  \nexpressed  genes were identified  using DESeq2  version  1.26.0  \n( 37 ). Fold change  values and Benjamini\u2013Hochberg  corrected  \nP -values  were used in a volcano  plot. The ENCODE  dataset  \n( 38 ) ENCSR247RPX  (doi:10.17989  / ENCSR247RPX)  was \nre-evaluated  for analysis  of developmental  expression  of \nmitolnc.  \nFor microarray  analysis,  RNA was isolated  using the TRI- \nzol method.  RNA labelling  and hybridization  to Affymetrix  \nMTA-1.0  arrays was performed  using the GeneChip  WT Plus \nReagent  Kit as per manufacturer\u2019s  instructions.  Data were an- \nalyzed  using DNAstar  ArrayStar  with RMA and evaluated  \nusing moderated  t -test. Gene set enrichment  analysis  (GSEA)  \nwas performed  using the GSEA desktop  software  application  \nwith Molecular  Signatures  Database  7.0 ( http://www.gsea-  \nmsigdb.org/  gsea/ index.jsp  ) with default  parameters  but using \nthe permutation  type gene set. GSEA determines  whether  a \npredefined  set of genes shows statistically  significant,  concor-  \ndant differences  between  two biological  states and thus helps \nto identify  relevant  biological  processes  ( 39 ). \nRNA for RT-qPCR  and TaqMan  Gene Expression  As- \nsays was isolated  from tissue or cells using the TRIzol  \nmethod.  cDNA  was synthesized  using 1 \u03bcg of RNA (200 \nng of mitochondrial  RNA) in combination  with the Prime-  \nScript RT-PCR  Kit (Takara  #RR014B)  according  to man- \nufacturer\u2019s  instructions.  For qPCR we used the Biozym  \nBlue S\u00b4Green  qPCR KIT separate  ROX (#331416S)  and the \nStepOne\u2122 Real-Time  PCR System  (Thermo).  Sequences  of \noligonucleotide  used in this study are listed in Supplementary  \nTable S1 . Relative  expression  was determined  using the \n/Delta1/Delta1Ct calculation.  Alternatively  predesigned  TaqMan  gene \nexpression  assays (Thermo)  were used (FAM-labeled:  BCK- \nDHA #Mm00476112_m1;  BCKDHB  #Mm01177077_m1;  \nDBT #Mm00501651_m1;  DLD #Mm00432831_m1;  BDK \n#Mm00437777_m1;  PPM1K  #Mm00615792_m1;  ACLY \n#Mm01302282_m1,  GAPDH  #Mm999999915_g1  (VIC- \nlabelled,  PL)). \nRNA-FISH  \nRNA-FISH  was performed  using isolated  cardiomyocytes  as \npreviously  described  ( 40 ) using ViewRNA  ISH Cell Assay \nKit (Affymetrix,  #QVC0001)  with the probe sets detect-  \ning mitolnc  (#VB1-18013,  type1-Alexa546,  custom-designed  \nagainst  bases 21\u2013266  of AK079912)  and ATP6 (#VB4-  \n3113886,  type4-Alexa488).  The experiment  was performed  \naccording  to manufactures  instructions  on isolated  mouse  car- \ndiomyocytes  which were fixed using 4% PFA / PBS for 10 min \nat room temperature.  \nRNA\u2013protein  pull-down  \nFor RNA\u2013protein  pull-down  experiments  mitolnc  and con- \ntrol lncRNAs  were in vitro transcribed  using appropriate  \nDNA T emplates.  T emplates  for RNA synthesis  were prepared  \neither by digestion  of plasmid  vectors  (MS-based  analysis:  \nAK086006,  Fantom2-cloneID:  D830044D09,  BamHI  [ctrl I]; \nAK010044,  Fantom2-cloneID:  2310065F04,  ScaI [ctrl II]; \nwestern  blot based analysis:  AK013794,  Fantom2-cloneID:  \n2900076A07,  Ecl136II  [ctrl]) or by PCR using a plasmid  \n(AK079912,  Fantom2-cloneID:  A530001O10  [mitolnc])  with \nappropriate  oligonucleotides  also providing  a T7 RNA poly- \nmerase  promoter  ( Supplementary  Table S1 ). In vitro tran- scription  was performed  using the T7 RiboMAXX\u2122 Express  \nLarge Scale RNA Production  System  (Promega  #P1320)  ac- \ncording  to the supplier\u2019s  protocol,  but with extension  of tran- \nscription  time to 2 h. For biotinylation  of the RNA we used \nPierce\u2122RNA  3\u00b4End Desthiobiotinylation  Kit (Thermo  Scien- \ntific #20163)  according  to manufacturer\u2019s  instructions.  RNA- \npulldown  was performed  using the Pierce TM Magnetic  RNA- \nProtein  Pull-Down  Kit (Thermo  Scientific  #20164).  For pro- \ntein extracts  of heart tissue, hearts of wildtype  mice were \nchopped  in a mortar  on dry ice and sonicated  in 1 ml RIPA \nbuffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl  pH 7.4, 1% NP-40,  0.25%  sodium  \ndeoxycholate,  150 mM NaCl, 1x Protease  Inhibitor  Cock- \ntail III [Merck  #539134],  1 U RNasin  [Promega  #N2611]).  \nThe beads were washed  twice with RIPA buffer followed  by \ncentrifugation  (12 500 rpm, 30 s, 4 \u25e6C). Interacting  proteins  \nwere identified  by mass spectrometry  after off-bead  digestion  \nas previously  described  ( 40 ). Additionally,  RNA\u2013protein  pull- \ndown was performed  using in vitro transcribed  RNA and pro- \ntein extracts  of HEK293  cells overexpressing  the respective  \nproteins  V5 tagged  at the C-terminus  in combination  with \nwestern  blot analysis.  \nIdentification  of RNA\u2013protein  interaction  sites \nRNA\u2013protein  interaction  sites were identified  following  the \nprotocol  of Bae et al.

Lysates  were freshly  pre- \npared as described  for the IP immediately  before  starting  \nthe assay using modified  RIPA (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl  pH 7.4, \nNucleic  Acids Research  , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 11 6635 \n1% NP-40,  0.25%  sodium  deoxycholate,  150 mM NaCl, \n1 \u00d7protease  inhibitor  cocktail  III (Merck  #539134,  1 U \nRNasin  (Promega  #N2611)),  1 x phosSTOP  TM (Merck  \n#4906845001).  Lysates  containing  100 \u03bcg of protein  were \nused for the ACLY Assay Kit (Bioscience  #79904)  according  \nto manufacturer\u2019s  instructions.  \nSucrose  density  gradient  centrifugation  \nTo analyze  the complex  stability  and density  we performed  \nsucrose  gradient  centrifugation  using protein  lysates  of WT \nand KO animal  hearts as described  ( 43 ). Protein  lysates  were \nprepared  as described  for IP using modified  RIPA (50 mM \nTris HCl, 150 mM NaCl: 1% NP40;  0.25%  sodium  deoxy-  \ncholate,  pH 7.4 with HCl). Protein  lysates  (1 mg / 300 \u03bcl) were \nadded on top of a sucrose  gradient  (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, \n25%, 30%, 35%, 40% sucrose).  Samples  were centrifuged  at \n38 300 rpm (250 000 \u00d7g; 16 h, 4 \u25e6C, Beckman  coulter  op- \ntima L30K;  rotor: SW41).  Thirteen  single fractions  were col- \nlected and proteins  were isolated  using a final concentration  \nof 7.5% TCA for 4 h at 4 \u25e6C, followed  by 5 min centrifuga-  \ntion at 16 000 \u00d7g. Protein  pellets  were washed  twice using \n100% acetone  followed  by 5 min centrifugation  at 16 000 \u00d7\ng. Proteins  were resuspended  in loading  buffer and analyzed  \nby western  blot. The blots were developed  using identical  ex- \nposure  times per target for both genotypes  respectively.  \nAnalysis  of coding  potential  and co-localization  \nFor in silico analysis  of the coding  potential  of lncRNAs  \nincluding  mitolnc  the tool Coding  Potential  Calculator  2 \n(CPC2)  was used ( http:// cpc2.gao-lab.org/  ). Sequences  of mi- \ntolnc and previously  described  lncRNAs  Nron, Hotair,  the mi- \ncropeptide  encoding  RNAs Dworf  and Myoregulin  as well \nas the protein-coding  RNAs of Acta1 and Gapdh  were used. \nAdditionally  potential  open reading  frames  were compared  \nto known  proteins  using the BLAST  tool. Fluorescence  mi- \ncroscopy  images  taken from RNA FISH experiments  were an- \nalyzed  for co-localization  of signals  for mitolnc  and atp6 us- \ning the coloc2  tool of ImageJ  / Fuji with autothreshold.  The co- \nlocalization  coefficient  tM1 was used to quantify  how many of \nthe pixels detected  in channel  2 (mitolnc  - red) are co-localized  \nwith the detected  objects  in channel  1 (ATP6  \u2013 green).  \nThereby,  100% of overlap  of the signal corresponds  to a value \nof 1 ( 44 ). \nStatistical  analysis  \nStatistical  analysis  was performed  using GraphPad  Prism V9. \nData were tested for normal  distribution  and Student\u2019s  t -test \nor the Mann\u2013Whitney  test were used accordingly.  For mul- \ntiple comparison  the Fisher LSD test was used in the course  \nof a two-way  Anova  multivariance  analysis.  Data are repre- \nsented  as mean \u00b1SEM. In case of multiple  data points data \nare represented  as Box and Whiskers  with the box extend-  \ning from the 25th to 75th percentiles,  the whiskers  are drawn  \nfrom the 10th percentile  to the 90th percentile  and points \nbelow and above are represented  by single data points.  Sta- \ntistical  significances  were reported  as P -values.  For evalua-  \ntion of proteomics  or transcriptomics  the data were normal-  \nized accordingly.  Z -scores  were calculated  for visualization  of \ndata. Results  \nIdentification  of a cardiac,  nuclear-encoded  \nmitochondrial  localized  lncRNA  \nTo identify  lncRNAs  with potential  functions  in cardiac  \nmitochondria,  we extracted  RNA from isolated  mitochon-  \ndria and the non-mitochondrial  fraction  of adult mouse  \nhearts.  Comparison  of RNA sequencing  data for each frac- \ntion, followed  by filtering  for lncRNAs  annotated  in the En- \nsembl genome  database,  identified  lncRNAs  enriched  in mito- \nchondria.  The lncRNA  GM44386  (AK079912),  subsequently  \nnamed  mitolnc,  was selected  for further  analysis  (Figure  1 A, \nSupplementary  Figure  S1 A), since nothing  is known  about its \nfunction  in the heart, although  expression  of mitolnc  in brown  \nadipose  tissue and a role in adipogenesis  has been reported  \nbefore  ( 45 ,46 ). Fractionation  of adult mouse  cardiomyocytes  \nin combination  with RT-qPCR  demonstrated  the localization  \nof mitolnc  outside  the nuclei (Figure  1 B) and RT-qPCR  using \nadditional  fractionation  of heart tissue corroborated  localiza-  \ntion inside the mitochondrial  fraction  (Figure  1 C). Mitolnc  \nis encoded  at mouse  chromosome  6qD1 and predominantly  \nexpressed  in the adult heart, brown  adipose  tissue (BAT),  ox- \nidative  skeletal  muscle,  and kidney.  Much weaker  or virtually  \nno expression  of mitolnc  was seen in the liver, brain, lung and \nspleen (Figure  1 D, Supplementary  Figure  S1 B). Mitolnc  is de- \ntected at lower levels in embryonic  compared  to adult hearts \n( Supplementary  Figure  S1 C), which corresponds  to the lower \nnumbers  of mitochondria  in immature  cardiomyocytes.  Bioin- \nformatic  analysis  confirmed  mitolnc  to be ncRNA  without  any \nconserved  ORF ( Supplementary  Figure  S1 D). \nTo investigate  the molecular  and physiological  functions  of \nmitolnc,  we generated  two different  mitolnc-deficient  mouse  \nmodels  either by deleting  the mitolnc  locus or by inserting  a \npolyA cassette.  Deletion  of the complete  mitolnc  locus, result-  \ning in a complete  null mutation,  was achieved  using a CAS9-  \nnickase  approach,  which reduces  potential  off-target  effects  \nof CAS9 ( 30 ). Insertion  of the polyA cassette  in the first exon \nby CAS9 also inactivated  the mitolnc  gene, eliminating  all de- \ntectable  mitolnc  expression  without  affecting  expression  of \nthe neighboring  PCBP1  gene ( Supplementary  Figure  S2 A\u2013H). \nBoth mouse  lines were viable showing  a Mendelian  distri- \nbution  of offspring,  without  any obvious  developmental  ab- \nnormalities,  including  normal  adipogenesis  ( Supplementary  \nFigure  S2 I\u2013M). RNA fluorescent  in situ hybridization  us- \ning adult mouse  cardiomyocytes  and probes  directed  against  \nmitolnc  and the mitochondrial  encoded  ATP6 corroborated  \nthe presence  of mitolnc  in cardiac  mitochondria.  No mitolnc  \nsignals  were detected  in mitolnc-deficient  cardiomyocytes,  \ndemonstrating  specificity  of the probes  (Figure  1 E, F). \nDeletion  of mitolnc  expression  induces  cardiac  \nh ypertroph  y in adult animals  \nAlthough  inactivation  of mitolnc  does not cause obvious  de- \nvelopmental  defects  in either mouse  model and heart weights  \nwere normal  at 8 weeks of age ( Supplementary  Figure  S2 K), \nwe noted increased  heart weights  in both mitolnc  deficient  \nmouse  models  at 16 weeks of age (Figure  2 A, Supplementary  \nFigure  S2 L, M). In line with this finding,  histological  analy- \nsis of cardiac  tissue at 16 weeks of age revealed  an increase  \nof the cross-sectional  area of cardiomyocytes  (Figure  2 B, C). \nUnbiased  examination  of transcriptome  data by gene set en- \nrichment  analysis  ( 39 ) using KEGG  gene sets revealed  en- \nrichment  of gene sets specific  for BCAA  catabolism,  fatty \n6636 Nucleic  Acids Research  , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 11 \nFigure 1.

Next, we investigated  \nthe cardiac  metabolome  to learn whether  the transcriptional  \nchanges  in mitolnc-deficient  hearts are also associated  with \nmetabolic  changes.  Importantly,  we observed  substantially  in- \ncreased  concentrations  of all three branched  chain amino  \nacids and of \u03b1-ketoglutarate,  which is probably  caused  via al- \nlosteric  activation  of GDH by leucine  (Figure  2 H). \nIncreased  concentrations  of leucine  are known  to acti- \nvate mTOR  signaling,  the latter being a well-characterized  \npathway  in the induction  of cardiac  hypertrophy  ( 1 , 15 , 47 ). \nTo confirm  activation  of mTOR  signaling  in mitolnc  de- \nficient hearts as a consequence  of elevated  leucine  levels, \nwe performed  a western  blot analysis,  which uncovered  in- \ncreased  p-mTOR  (Ser2448)  and p -4E-BP1  (Thr37  / 46) con- \ncentrations  in mitolnc-deficient  compared  to WT hearts (Fig- \nure 3 A\u2013C). To corroborate  the causal relation  between  in- \ncreased  BCAA  levels and activation  of mTOR  signaling,  WT mice were fed with a BCAA-rich  chow, which increased  BCAA  \nserum levels ( Supplementary  Figure  S3 A, B), and also in- \ncreased  phosphorylation  of mTOR  at serine2448  in hearts \n( Supplementary  Figure  S3 C, D). Next, we inhibited  mTOR  \nsignaling  in mitolnc-deficient  hearts by administration  of ra- \npamycin.  Suppression  of mTOR  signaling  abrogated  differ- \nences in heart weight  between  WT and mitolnc  deficient  an- \nimals, demonstrating  that leucine-dependent  mTOR  activa-  \ntion is responsible  for induction  of cardiac  hypertrophy  in \nmutant  animals,  although  additional  mechanisms  contribut-  \ning to cardiac  hypertrophy  cannot  be ruled out (Figure  3 D\u2013H, \nSupplementary  Figure  S3 E\u2013G). \nMitolnc  expression  is also detected  in BAT and skeletal  \nmuscle,  where its localization  is confined  to mitochondria  \nof adipocytes  and skeletal  muscle  myofibers,  similar  as in \ncardiomyocytes  ( Supplementary  Figure  S4 A, B). Transcrip-  \ntome analysis  of BAT revealed  an enrichment  of gene sets \nrelated  to BCAA  and fatty acid metabolism  ( Supplementary  \nFigure  S4 C\u2013E), but no significant  changes  in BCAA  \nNucleic  Acids Research  , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 11 6637 \nFigure 2.

( H ) Increased  \nconcentration  of the branched  chain amino acid leucine results in mTOR activation  and in cardiac hypertrophy.  In vivo the mitolnc\u2013BCKDH  interaction  \nresults in increased  degradation  of BCAAs and thus pre v ents h ypertroph  y. Cardiac h ypertroph  y due to decreased  BCKDH  activity after loss of mitolnc is \nrescued  by inhibiton  of mTOR using rapamycin.  \nconcentrations  were detected  in this tissue ( Supplementary  \nFigure  S4 F), indicating  a lower physiological  impact  of mi- \ntolnc in BAT compared  to cardiac  tissue. No changes  in the \nconcentration  of free BCAAs  were detected  in liver and serum \nof mitolnc  deficient  mice ( Supplementary  Figure  S4 G\u2013I), \nexcluding  systemic  effects  of increased  BCAAs  concentration  \non the heart. \nMitolnc  interacts  with essential  enzymes  of the \nBCAA  catabolism  \nTo gain insights  how the loss of mitolnc  increases  the con- \ncentration  of cardiac  BCAAs,  we searched  for proteins  poten-  \ntially interacting  with mitolnc  by RNA\u2013protein  pull-down  as- \nsays using in vitro synthesized  lncRNAs  coupled  to biotin and \nincubated  with cardiac  protein  lysates.  To control  for non- specific  interactions  between  RNAs and proteins  in this as- \nsay, we included  two additional  control-lncRNAs.  RNA inter- \nacting proteins  were identified  by mass-spectrometry,  reveal-  \ning specific  interactions  of mitolnc  with components  of the \nBCKDH  complex  (Figure  4 A). The BCKDH  complex  medi- \nates the first irreversible  step in the catabolism  of BCAAs  by \ndecarboxylation  of BCAA-derived  ketoacids.  Reduced  activity  \nof the BCKDH  complex  leads to accumulation  of BCAAs  and \ncauses  maple syrup urine disease  (MSUD)  ( 3 ). To confirm  the \ninteraction  between  mitolnc  and components  of the BCKDH  \ncomplex,  we used mitolnc  to pull down V5-tagged  BCKDH  \ncomplex  components  expressed  in HEK293  cells, followed  by \nwestern  blot analysis.  We detected  interactions  of mitolnc  with \nthe E1 subunits  of the BCKDH  complex,  comprising  BCK- \nDHA and BCKDHB,  as well as interactions  with the E2 / E3 \nsubunits  DBT and DLD (Figure  4 B). \nNucleic  Acids Research  , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 11 6639 \nFigure 4.

In line with \nthe mitochondrial  localization  of mitolnc  and BCKDH,  rISH- \nPLA signals  overlapped  with MitoTracker  Deep Red staining  \n( Supplementary  Figure  S5 A-C). In contrast,  no signals  were \nobtained  when antibodies  against  DBT, the E2 component  of \nthe BCKDH  complex,  were employed  in this assay, which is \nin conflict  with the results  from the pull-down  experiments  \n(Figure  4 D, E). We reason  that the increased  concentration  of \nDBT due to overexpression  facilitates  its indirect  pull-down  \nby mitolnc  via interaction  with BCKDHA,  whereas  rISH-PLA  \nis done in a physiological  setting,  avoiding  such artefacts  and \ndetecting  more specifically  proximity  of the molecules.  \nFor further  analysis  of the BCKDH\u2013mitolnc  interaction,  we \ninvestigated  direct RNA\u2013protein  contacts  by comparing  pro- \ntein extracts  of UV-crosslinked  mitochondria  isolated  from \nWT and mitolnc  \u2212/ \u2212hearts followed  by hydrofluoric  acid \ntreatment  and mass spectrometry  (HF-MS).  After isolation  \nof the cross-linked  RNA\u2013protein  complexes,  phosphodiester  \nbonds of the RNA were cleaved  using hydrofluoric  acid, \nwhich leaves a crosslinked  uridine  residue  of the RNA at pep- \ntides ( 41 ). Subsequent  mass spectrometry  analysis  identified  \na uridine-modified,  BCKDHA-derived  peptide  only in WT but \nnot in mitolnc  \u2212/ \u2212protein  extracts  ( Supplementary  Figure  \nS5 D\u2013F), further  corroborating  the interaction  of mitolnc  with \nmitochondrial  BCKDHA  in vivo . The analysis  also indicated  \nthat the interaction  of mitolnc  with BCKDHA  occurs  at a site \nclose to essential  BCKDHA  cofactor  binding  and regulatory  \nphosphorylation.  \nTo further  characterize  the interaction  of mitolnc  and \nBCKDH  complex,  we analyzed  several  mutants  of BCKDHA  \nand mitolnc.  We found that a part of the first exon of mi- \ntolnc, including  a sequence  motif conserved  between  mouse  \nand human  ( Supplementary  Figure  S1 B), is essential  and suffi- \ncient for the interaction  with BCKDHA.  In contrast,  RNA se- \nquence  downstream  of the conserved  sequence  motif in exon \n1 and sequences  in exon 2 are dispensable  for the interaction  \nwith BCKDHA  (Figure  4 F). We found that the first 192 aa of \nBCKDHA  are not essential  for the interaction  with mitolnc,  \nwhereas  deletion  of the protein  domain  containing  the peptide  \nidentified  by HF-MS  (del5, Figure  4 G, H) as well as deletion  \nof the BCKDHA  cofactor  binding  sites abolishes  BCKDH-  \nmitolnc  interactions.  \nLoss of mitolnc  reduces  the activity  of BCKDC  and \nACLY in cardiomyocytes  \nThe accumulation  of BCAAs  in the heart of mitolnc-deficient  \nmice made it likely that mitolnc  is required  to achieve  high \nenzymatic  activity  of BCKDH.  To directly  test this possibil-  \nity, we determined  the activity  of the BCKDH  complex  in \nWT and mitolnc-deficient  heart tissue. We used an assay in \nwhich the release  of 14 C from 14 C labelled  ketoacid  of va- \nline \u03b1-keto [1- 14 C] isovalerate  ( 14 C KIV) is employed  to mea- \nsure the activity  of the BCKDH  complex  (Figure  5 A) ( 9 ). \nWe observed  a significant  reduction  of BCKDH  complex  ac- \ntivity in mitolnc-deficient  compared  to WT control  hearts (Figure  5 B), despite  equal protein  levels of BCKDH  com- \nplex components  ( Supplementary  Figure  S6 ). Loss of mitolnc  \nmight reduce  BCKDH  complex  activity  due to various  rea- \nsons, including  changes  in the subcellular  localization  of the \nBCKDH  complex  or alteration  of posttranslational  modifica-  \ntions. First, we tested whether  mitolnc  affects  the transport  of \nBCKDH  complex  components.  Subcellular  fractionation,  fol- \nlowed by western  blot analysis  of the different  fractions  did \nnot reveal any differences  in the mitochondrial  localization  \nof BCKDH  complex  components  between  WT controls  and \nmitolnc-deficient  hearts ( Supplementary  Figure  S6 ). Next, we \nanalyzed  changes  in the phosphorylation  of BCKDH,  since its \nactivity  is suppressed  by phosphorylation  at Ser293  of BCK- \nDHA (Figure  5 A). Surprisingly,  we observed  decreased  phos- \nphorylation  of BCKDHA  in mitolnc-deficient  hearts (Figure  \n5 C, D), although  decreased  phosphorylation  normally  indi- \ncates high enzymatic  activity  of the BCKDH  complex.  \nPhosphorylation  of BCKDHA  is accomplished  by the \nbranched  chain ketoacid  dehydrogenase  kinase  (BDK)  and \ncounteracted  by the protein  phosphatase  1K (PPM1K),  which \ndephosphorylates  BCKDHA  to increase  its activity.  We found \nthat the reduced  phosphorylation  of BCKDHA  by BDK is \nnot associated  with changes  in the abundance  of BDK or \nPPM1K,  as indicated  by western  blots analysis  (Figure  5 E, F), \nbut most likely caused  by allosteric  inhibition  of BDK via \u03b1- \nketoisocaproate  (KIC) derived  from increased  concentrations  \nof leucine.  KIC accumulates  upon increase  of leucine  and rep- \nresents  an important  component  of the feedback  loop, ac- \ntivating  BCKDH  to cope with an increased  load of BCAAs  \n( 48 ,49 ). The results  also underscore  the importance  of mitolnc  \nfor achieving  high BCKDH  complex  activity,  since BCKDH  \ncomplex  activity  was low in mitolnc-deficient  hearts,  despite  \nmassive  dephosphorylation  of BCKDHA.  \nInterestingly,  we also detected  decreased  phosphorylation  \nof the ATP citrate  lyase (ACLY)  (Figure  5 G, H), required  for \ncytosolic  generation  of acetyl-CoA  for de novo lipogenesis  \nbut also for epigenetic  regulation  through  histone  acetylation  \n( 50 ). ACLY was recently  described  to be co-regulated  by the \nBDK / PPM1K  system  to allow integration  of BCAA  and lipid \nmetabolism  ( 9 ). In line with the lowered  phosphorylation  of \nACLY,  we found strongly  decreased  ACLY activity  in cardiac  \nlysates  (Figure  5 I). We also observed  an inverse  correlation  \nbetween  expression  of mitolnc  and PPM1K  / BDK / ACLY in \nsome tissues,  suggesting  that activation  of BCAA  catabolism  \nby mitolnc  primarily  happens  in tissues,  in which expression  \nof components  of the BDK / PPM1K  / ACLY regulon  is compar-  \natively  low (Figure  5 J). In conclusion,  the decreased  activity  of \nACLY in mitolnc-deficient  hearts may reflect the requirement  \nof some cell types to regulate  BCKDH  complex  activity  in- \ndependently  of BDK and PPM1K,  i.e. to stimulate  activity  of \nthe BCKDH  complex  independent  of BDK, thereby  avoiding  \ndirect effects  on ACLY.  \nMitolnc  allosterically  activates  the BCKDH  complex  \nWe found that mitolnc  does neither  affect mitochondrial  local- \nization  of the BCKDH  complex  nor increase  repressive  phos- \nphorylation  of BCKDHA,  which leaves a role of mitolnc  in \nthe assembly  of the BCKDH  complex  or a direct function  as \nallosteric  activator  as potential  modes  of action.  To analyze  \nwhether  loss of mitolnc  affects  composition  of the BCKDH  \ncomplex,  we immunoprecipitated  the BCKDH  complex  from \nheart lysates  of WT and mitolnc-deficient  hearts using \nNucleic  Acids Research  , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 11 6641 \nFigure 5.

We quantita-  \ntively identified  all components  of the BCKDH  complex  in- \ncluding  BCKDHA,  BCKDHB,  DBT and DLD in both IP ex- \nperiments  as well as additional  proteins  annotated  to belong  \nto the BCAA  degradation  pathway,  without  detecting  any ap- \nparent  differences  in complex  composition  between  WT and \nmitolnc-deficient  hearts ( Supplementary  Figure  S7 C\u2013O). The \nunchanged  composition  of the BCKDH  complex  in mitolnc-  \ndeficient  hearts strongly  argues  against  a function  of mitolnc  \nas an adaptor  to facilitate  assembly  of the complex  or to re- \ncruit additional  components.  \nNext, we tested whether  mitolnc  might directly  stimulate  \nBCKDH  complex  activity  by acting as an allosteric  activator.  \nWe added in vitro transcribed  mitolnc  to cardiac  extracts  of mitolnc  deficient  mice and observed  a significant  increase  in \nBCKDH  complex  activity,  whereas  addition  of mutant  vari- \nants of mitolnc  did not have any effects  (Figure  6 A, B). More-  \nover, we expressed  the BCKDH  complex  either with mitolnc  \nor its mutant  variants  in HEK293  and Hep2G  cells. Inclusion  \nof full length mitolnc  increased  activity  of the BCKDH  com- \nplex in HEK293  and Hep2G  cells, which normally  do not \nexpress  mitolnc  (Figure  6 C, D). We also detected  increased  \nBCKDH  complex  activity  when adding  in vitro transcribed  \nmitolnc  to extracts  of HEK293  cells (Figure  6 E), conclusively  \ndemonstrating  that mitolnc  directly  enhances  the enzymatic  \nactivity  of the BCKDH  complex.  Since HEK293  are of hu- \nman origin,  these results  also indicate  that the mechanism  of \nlncRNA-dependent  enzyme  activation  is conserved  between  \nspecies.

The BCKDHA  and DLD subunits  \nof the BCKDH  complex  were detected  in the same fractions  \nof the gradient  when comparing  WT and mitolnc-deficient  \nhearts.  However,  absence  of mitolnc  shifted  the localization  \nof BCKDHA  and DLD subunits  to a different  fraction  with \nlower density  (Figure  6 F, G), suggesting  changes  in protein  \nconformation.  \nDiscussion  \nHere, we describe  the unexpected  function  of the long non- \ncoding  RNA mitolnc  as an allosteric  activator  of the mito- \nchondrial  BCKDH  complex  and its role in regulating  car- \ndiac metabolism.  We found that allosteric  activation  of the \nBCKDH  complex  by mitolnc  is critical  to reduce  local concen-  \ntrations  of leucine  in cardiomyocytes,  thereby  preventing  un- \nwanted  mTOR  activation  and cardiac  hypertrophy.  Our work \ndiscloses  a previously  unknown  mechanism  of BCKDH  com- \nplex regulation  that allows  control  of BCAA  catabolism  in- \ndependent  of BDK / PPM1K-mediated  control  of phosphory-  \nlation of BCKDHA,  essentially  decoupling  BCCA  catabolism  \nfrom generation  of citrate-derived  acetyl-CoA  by ACLY.  \nBDK / PPM1K-dependent  phosphorylation  of BCKDHA  is \nhigh in the heart, suggesting  inhibition  of BCKDH  complex  \nenzyme  activity,  despite  the high oxidative  flux of BCAA  ( 51 ), \nwhich is difficult  to understand.  Availability  of substrates,  con- \ncentration  of reaction  products  as well as allosteric  regula-  \ntion of BCAA  decarboxylation  has been discussed  to explain  \nthis obvious  contradiction,  but no convincing  explanation  was \nprovided.  Here, we offer a solution  for this conundrum  by \nidentifying  mitolnc  as an allosteric  activator  of the BCKDH  \ncomplex,  independent  of its phosphorylation  status.  Mitolnc  \nexpression  is highest  in the heart, exactly  the organ in which \nan allosteric  activator  is needed  to counteract  BDK-mediated  \nphosphorylation,  resulting  in suppression  of BCKDH  com- \nplex activity.  \nInterestingly,  BDK and the corresponding  phosphatase  \nPPM1K  also control  activity  of ACLY and potentially  other \nmetabolic  enzymes  ( 9 ). ACLY is part of the citrate-malate  \nshuttle,  transferring  acetyl-CoA  from mitochondria  to the cy- \ntoplasm.  In contrast  to BCKDHA,  phosphorylation  of ACLY \nby BDK-mediated  phosphorylation  increases  ACLY activ- \nity, coupling  BCAA  metabolism  with cytosolic  generation  of \nacetyl-CoA  and fatty acid synthesis.  Under homeostatic  con- \nditions  de novo lipogenesis  does not play an important  role in \nheart physiology  but becomes  a critical  limiting  factor during  \nthe stress of acute pressure  overload  and aging ( 52 ). More-  \nover , ACL Y plays a pivotal  role for supplying  acetyl-CoA,  re- \nquired  for epigenetic  regulation  of cardiomyocytes  through  \nhistone  acetylation  ( 50 ), which is particularly  important  for \nthe control  of cardiac  growth  during  development  and for \nstress-dependent  cardiac  remodelling  ( 53 ). The regulation  of \nBCKDH  complex  activity  by mitolnc  avoids  the cross-talk  to \nACLY by uncoupling  control  of enzyme  activity  from phos- \nphorylation,  thus promoting  a high activity  of the BCKDH  \ncomplex  to remove  high concentrations  of BCAAs,  even un- \nder conditions  when a high activity  of ACLY is required.  The \nimportance  to keep BCAA  concentrations  in cardiomyocytes  \nlow becomes  apparent  from the development  of cardiac  hy- pertrophy  in mitolnc-deficient  mice but also after feeding  large \namounts  of BCAAs.  \nApparently,  the requirement  for uncoupling  BCKDHA  \nphosphorylation  from ACLY activity  differs  between  different  \norgans,  which is reflected  by the tissue-specific  expression  of \nmitolnc.  Our work indicates  that organs  have to cope with in- \ncreased  BCAA  loads locally  by adjusting  catabolic  pathways.  \nWe found that reduction  of the BCKDH  complex  activity  in \nmitolnc-deficient  mice resulted  in a local increase  of BCAA  \nconcentrations  in the heart, without  an increase  in the serum \nof mitolnc-deficient  mice, which seems to exclude  export  of \nBCAAs  from cardiomyocytes  as a means  to lower BCAA  con- \ncentrations  in the heart. We also noted an inverse  correlation  \nof the two molecules  that activate  the BCKDH  complex  by \ndifferent  mechanisms.  Mitolnc  is highly expressed  in heart, \nbrown  adipose  tissue, oxidative  skeletal  muscle,  and kidney,  \nwhereas  expression  of PPM1K  is lower in these tissues  but \nmuch stronger  in the liver, spleen,  lung and brain, indicating  \norgan-specific  requirements.  So far, we did not identify  regula-  \ntory stimuli  that change  expression  of mitolnc.  Further  work \nis needed  to understand  whether  mitolnc  contributes  to the \ndynamic  adjustment  of BCKDH  activity  under different  dis- \nease or metabolic  conditions.  In contrast  to the tissue-specific  \nactivation  of the BCKDH  complex  evoked  by mitolnc,  the reg- \nulation  of BCKDHA  phosphorylation  by BDK followed  an es- \ntablished  pattern.  The increase  of BCAAs  in mitolnc-deficient  \nhearts most likely reduces  phosphorylation  of BCKDHA  at \nSer293  ( 4 , 54 , 55 ), to increase  enzyme  activity.  The reduced  \nphosphorylation  of BCKDHA  is clearly  part of a compen-  \nsatory cellular  response  to increase  enzyme  activity  caused  by \naccumulation  of BCAAs.  Concentrations  of BCAAs  were in \nequilibrium  with the corresponding  branched  chain ketoacids  \n(BCKAs)  due to the reversible  BCAT-mediated  transamina-  \ntion, which explains  the increase  of BCAAs,  although  BCKAs  \nand not BCAAs  are the direct substrates  of the BCKDH  com- \nplex. \nThe identification  of mitolnc  as an allosteric  activator  of the \nmitochondrial  BCKDH  complex  was a surprise  but not com- \npletely  unexpected.  LncRNAs  serve multiple  different  roles \nranging  from functions  in chromatin  and transcriptional  con- \ntrol to the regulation  of protein  complex  assembly.  Many \nlncRNAs  are retained  in the nucleus  but some are trans- \nported  to different  subcellular  structures,  suggesting  specific  \nfunctions  at these sites ( 24 ). Localization  of nuclear  encoded  \nlncRNA  in mitochondria  is not common  and we are not aware \nof another  published  lncRNA  that is located  in cardiac  mito- \nchondria,  although  some examples  of mitochondrially  local- \nized lncRNAs  exist for other cell types ( 25 ,26 ). The mecha-  \nnisms enabling  transfer  of lncRNAs  are not understood  very \nwell but described  to be supported  by the polynucleotide  phos- \nphorylase  (PNPASE)  located  at the mitochondrial  intermem-  \nbrane space ( 56 ). RNA sequence  elements  essential  for the \nimport  of RNA into mitochondria  have been identified  ( 56 ), \nbut no consensus  sequence  motif is known  that is necessary  \nand sufficient  for RNA import  into mitochondria.  The abun- \ndance of some mitochondrial  localized  lncRNAs  depends  on \nthe RNA binding  protein  GRSF1,  located  in the mitochon-  \ndrial matrix  ( 25 ). Our data demonstrate  localization  of mi- \ntolnc within  mitochondria  and establish  functional  interaction  \nwith the BCKDH  complex  in the mitochondrial  matrix.  At \npresent,  we do not know how mitolnc  enters mitochondria,  i.e. \nwhether  the import  happens  concomitant  with the transport  \nof BCKDH  complex  components,  independently  via known  \n6644 Nucleic  Acids Research  , 2024, Vol. 52, No. 11 \nmitochondrial  transporters,  or by novel pathways.  In the heart \nof mitolnc  deficient  animals  we observe  cardiac  hypertrophy  \nand increase  of BCCAs.  Attenuation  of BCAA-induced  mTOR  \nactivity  by treatment  with rapamycin  prevented  cardiac  hyper-  \ntrophy  and restored  a normal  phenotype  in mitolnc-deficient  \nanimals.  These data strongly  suggest  -together  with the local- \nization  of mitolnc  in mitochondria-  that the role of mitolnc  is \nrestricted  to the regulation  of BCKDH,  although  we do not \nwant to exclude  potential  other functions.  \nOur results  provide  striking  evidence  that mitolnc  directly  \nstimulates  BCKDH  activity  by an allosteric  mechanism.  We \nexcluded  indirect  effects,  such as an impact  on the mito- \nchondrial  localization  of BCKDH  complex  components  and \nchanges  in the composition  of the complex.  Addition  of mi- \ntolnc to extracts  isolated  from mitolnc  deficient  hearts or \nHEK293  cells increased  the activity  of the respective  BCKDH  \ncomplex,  which in our view is a strong  argument  for allosteric  \nactivation.  It might still be argued  that mitolnc  recruits  or re- \npels an unknown  protein  not detected  in our IP experiments,  \nwhich alters BCKDH  complex  activity,  although  we consider  \nsuch a scenario  unlikely.  Moreover,  we found that the presence  \nof mitolnc  changes  migration  of the BCKDH  complex  in su- \ncrose gradients,  probably  by changing  conformation  and den- \nsity of complex  components.  Finally,  analysis  of mutant  BCK- \nDHA subunits  indicates  that mitolnc  closely  interacts  with \nthe active center of the BCKDH  complex  core subunit  BCK- \nDHA. Future  structural  studies  of the BCKDH  complex  in \npresence  or absence  of mitolnc  using cryoEM  or similar  tech- \nniques  might reveal more exhaustive  insights  into the molec-  \nular mechanism  of the mitolnc-BCKDH  interaction.  \nExpression  and function  of mitolnc  were analyzed  in Mus \nmusculus  . The human  genome  contains  syntenic  sequence  el- \nements  conserved  between  mouse  and human  and this con- \nserved  sequence  corresponds  to the first exon of mouse  mi- \ntolnc that is important  for the interaction  with BCKDHA.  \nHowever,  we have not been able to detect mitolnc  RNA ex- \npression  in humans,  which might be due to technical  limita-  \ntions. Importantly,  we demonstrated  that mitolnc  increases  ac- \ntivity of the BCKDH  complex  in extracts  of human  HEK293  \ncells, clearly  indicating  that the regulatory  principle  exploited  \nby mouse  mitolnc  is active in humans  too. It also seems pos- \nsible that the transcript  of mouse  mitolnc  was not conserved  \nin humans  but was replaced  by another  lncRNA  with a differ- \nent primary  sequence  but similar  conformation,  still allowing  \nallosteric  activation  of human  BCKDH  complex.  Even if a hu- \nman homologue  of mitolnc  does not exist, because  of differ- \nent physiological  needs and divergent  evolution  of mammals,  \nthe ability  to change  enzymatic  activity  of human  BCKDH  \ncomplex  by lncRNAs  is clearly  conserved.  Thus, it will be \npossible  to use lncRNAs  for manipulation  of aberrant  BCAA  \nmetabolism  in humans,  which contributes  to heart failure  and \nother cardiac  diseases  in numerous  contexts  ( 1 ). \nData availability  \nRNA-Seq  data were submitted  to NCBI GEO ( www.ncbi.  \nnlm.nih.gov/geo  #GSE235581,  GSE235759  and GSE235762.  \nMicroarray  data were submitted  to the ArrayExpress  ( http: \n// www.ebi.ac.uk/  biostudies/  #E-MT  AB- 13047,  #E-MT  AB- \n13048.
