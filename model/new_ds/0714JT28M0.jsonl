Magnesium and \nits alloys have recently emerged in clinics as orthopedics implantable metals but mostly restricted to mechanical \ndevices. Here, by deposition of calcium-based bilayer coating on the surface, a Mg-based composite implant \nplatform is developed with tailored degradation characteristics, simultaneously integrated with chemothera -\npeutic (Taxol) loading capacity. The delicate modulation of Mg degradation occurring in aqueous environment is \nobserved to play dual roles, not only in eliciting desirable osteoinductivity, but allows for modification of tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME) owing to the continuous release of degradation products. Specifically, the sustainable \nH2 evolution and Ca2\u0087from the implant is distinguished to cooperate with local Taxol delivery to achieve su-\nperior antineoplastic activity through activating Cyt-c pathway to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, which in \nturn leads to significant tumor-growth inhibition in vivo. In addition, the local chemotherapeutic delivery of the \nimplant minimizes toxicity and side effects, but markedly fosters osteogenesis and bone repair with appropriate \nstructure degradation in rat femoral defect model. Taken together, a promising intraosseous administration \nstrategy with biodegradable Mg-based implants to facilitate tumor-associated bone defect is proposed.   \n1.Introduction \nBone cancers, which consists of primary and metastatic tumors, are \nthe most severe and incurable bone disease globally, and have a dele-\nterious influence on survival, quality of life and health expenditure \n[1\u20133]. Primary bone cancers, such as osteosarcoma and Ewing \u2019s sar-\ncoma, always start in the bone or cartilage and are frequently diagnosed \nin children and adolescents [4]. In particular, osteosarcoma has become \nthe second leading cause of tumor-related death in young people. Metastatic bone cancers occur in 65\u201380 % of patients with breast and \nprostate cancers and are frequently found in lung, liver and kidney \ncancers [5\u20137]. At present, surgical intervention, consisting of resection \nof the bone-localized tumor followed by combined treatment of the \nsurrounding tissues with chemo/radiotherapy, is the mainstream clin-\nical modality for bone cancer to prevent recurrence, but has reached its \nlimit of efficacy [8]. Moreover, traditional chemo/radiotherapy are \noften associated with inevitable problems including severe side effects of \ndrugs to healthy tissues or even systemic toxicity, the development of \nPeer review under responsibility of KeAi Communications Co., Ltd. \n*Corresponding author.

It thus motivates efforts to develop innovative therapeutic op-\ntions with compelling biosafety and efficacy, among which local bone \ntherapy [12\u201314] through the employment of a drug carrier or implant \nbiomaterial to diseased bone tissue has recently emerged as an attractive \nstrategy [15]. \nSurgical intervention of tumor-associated bone defect often leads to \ndifficult to treat bone defects [16]. In addition to clinical autograft and \nallograft transplant, bone substitute biomaterials with favorable osteo -\ngenesis capability provide another promising avenue for facilitating the \nhealing of bone defects after tumor resection. Furthermore, to reduce the \nrisk of local bone cancer recurrence, it is essential to eliminate residual \ntumor cells around bone defects [17]. Suitable biomaterials capable of \nsimultaneously providing anti-tumor therapy and promoting bone \nregeneration are thus favored, whereas many implant materials often \nsuffer from one or more drawbacks, e.g. poor bioactivity, lack sufficient \nmechanical strength, etc. Resulting in unsatisfactory in vivo outcomes \n[18]. Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys have recently been proposed as a \nnew-generation biodegradable implant material in the orthopedic field. \nIn contrast to permanent biometals, Mg eliminates the need for a second \nsurgical intervention to remove the implant and minimize stress \nshielding effects because of their similar elastic modulus to that of \nnatural bones [19]. Moreover, recent studies have revealed the desir-\nable, stimulatory effects of its main degradation products of Mg2\u0087on \ndirected osteogenic differentiation and facilitating fracture repair [20], \nthus revealing its great therapeutic potential in treating bone diseased. \nNevertheless, detrimental effects of overfast degradation of Mg implant \nhave also been observed, including the gas cavity formed by burst \nhydrogen (H2) release of Mg implant, and moreover, deterioration of \nbiocaompatibility and the complexity of the Mg2\u0087-induced immuno -\nmodulation on macrophages and bone resorption [21], which hamper \nbone regeneration, thus emphasizing the importance of degradation \ncontrol. To effectively satisfy the genuine demands of orthopedic im-\nplants, it is imperative to corrosion rate while maintain mechanical \nintegrity for an extended duration, and to limit the emission of H2, which \ncan be accomplished through the process of alloying or other prepara -\ntory techniques [22,23]. A complementary approach to advancing the \ntechnology of Mg alloys is through surface modification. The utilization \nof coatings is a viable strategy to bolster the resistance to corrosion and \nthe biocompatibility of the implants. On the other hand, it has been \nreported that the high alkalinity and H2 gas generated during the \ndegradation of naked Mg have cytotoxic effects on osteosarcoma cells in \nvitro [24]. However, achieving significant and long-term H2 release in \nthe tumor to produce the best anticancer therapeutic impact is still problematic [25,26]. Therefore, in addition to alloying and processing \nthe Mg matrix, it is important and necessary to regulate the Mg \nbiodegradation through the development of a rational design surface \ncoating for appropriately exerting its beneficial role in facilitating bone \nreconstruction and repair while combating bone tumor recurrence [27, \n28]. \nApart from magnesium, calcium and lots of its compounds are well- \nadvocated to promote osteoblast proliferation, migration and osteogenic \ndifferentiation. Furthermore, calcium ions (Ca2\u0087) can also play a vital \nrole in tumor therapy through activating mitochondrial apoptosis \npathways, resulting in Ca2\u0087-overloading-induced cancer cell death [29, \n30]. Hence, to integrate the multifunctionalities required for treating \ntumor-induced bone defect, herein, we propose the development of a \nMg-based composite implant (BM/PLAT/CP) through fabrication of a \nbilayer coating platform with chemotherapeutic loading capacity, and \ntailored degradation characteristics for synergistic local therapy \n(Scheme 1). The bilayer coating consists of an inner layer of poly (lactic \nacid) with typical chemotherapy drug-Taxol (abbreviated as PLAT) and \nan outer layer of calcium phosphate-based rough coating (CP). The \nresultant implant is capable of locally co-delivering Mg biodegradation \nproducts and chemotherapeutic drugs in a well-controlled, sustained \nmanner. Taking the advantages, we postulate that this Mg-based implant \ncould concurrently promote the formation of new bones and alleviate or \neven prevent bone tumor recurrence and consequently offer superior \nefficacy in treating tumor-induced bone defects, owing to the appro -\npriate control of the overfast Mg degradation and the sustainable release \nof degradation products (Ca2\u0087, H2) to synergize the local chemothera -\npeutics. The in vitro viability, direct adhesion and proliferation of cells \non the implant surface and the influence of the degradation extracts, are \nstudied in combination with MC3T3 osteoblasts and MNNG osteosar -\ncoma cells, respectively. The preliminary anti-tumor mechanism with \nthis local implant strategy is also explored. The corresponding in vivo \neffects on tumor-induced bone defect are investigated in nude mice with \nosteosarcoma and in Sprague \u2012Dawley (SD) rats with femoral defects, \nrespectively. \n2.Results \n2.1. Mg-based implant characterization \nThe biodegradable BM/PLAT/CP implant was prepared and depos -\nited with a bilayer coating platform of poly (lactic acid) (PLA)/calcium \nphosphate (CP). Fig. 1a confirmed that the composite implants consisted \nof designated coatings with an inner layer of PLA loaded with a typical \nScheme 1.Schematic diagram of BM/PLAT/CP implant design and bio-application in treating tumor-induced bone defects.

The thicknesses of the bilayer coatings were \noptimized for this study to obtain a suitable implant degradation profile \nto match new bone growth, meanwhile maintaining a sustainable, \ncontrolled release of both drugs and degradation products for desirable \nbio-efficacy. Additionally, the morphology of the outermost layer was \nalso modulated and optimized through chemical solution synthesis to achieve favorable osteoblastic cell responses [31]. In Fig. 1b it clearly \nexhibited that the as-prepared PLAT coating was intact and uniform, and \nimportantly, there was no obvious drug aggregates or microphase sep-\naration. Cross-sectional SEM images of the BM/PLAT/CP implant were \nshown in Fig. 1c and d. Fig. 1c illustrated the presence of numerous \ndegraded CP flakes on the surface of the BM/PLAT/CP specimens.

Q. Guan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nBioactive Materials 40 (2024) 445\u2013459\n448UV-pretreated PLA film. The microscale-rough CP layer with a nested \nstructure completely covered the PLA coating loaded with Taxol. The \nthicknesses of the PLA layers loaded with Taxol and the outermost \nbrushite layer were determined of ~3 \u03bcm and ~6\u20137 \u03bcm, respectively \n(Fig. 1d). As shown in Fig. S1, the surface roughness of BM/PLAT/CP \nwas determined to be 4.15 \u00b10.3 \u03bcm using a stylus surface profiler. This \nsurface microroughness might contribute to the promoted adhesion and \nproliferation of osteoblastic cells, as compared to the smoother surfaces \nincluding BM/MgF 2 (0.31 \u00b10.13 \u03bcm) and BM/PLA (0.21 \u00b10.10 \u03bcm), \naccording to several previous reports on the effects of microroughness \non osteoblasts [32]. In addition, the adhesion of the composite coating \nwas evaluated using the \u201cTape Test\u201d, as illustrated in the representative \nimage shown in Fig. S2. The test revealed that the surface remained \nintact which corresponds to an ASTM 5B rating, indicating excellent \nadhesion with less than 5 % of the coating being removed or detached. \nThese findings confirmed that the bilayer coatings could adhere tightly \nto each other and to the underlying Mg-based substrate. The excellent \nadhesion was most likely due to the strong coordination interaction \nbetween the abundant carboxylic ester groups of PLA and the Ca2\u0087in CP \ncoatings. \n2.2. In vitro degradation and drug release \nThe in vitro degradation product release profiles and calculated \ndegradation rates of BM/PLAT/CP implants for up to 2 months were \ndisplayed in Fig. 1e\u2013h. In contrast to the previously reported naked Mg \nalloy, the pH of the BM/PLAT/CP group during degradation only \nincreased gently to ~8.10 of desirable weak alkalinity, and the osmo -\nlality and cumulative release profile of Mg2\u0087exhibited a nearly linear \ngrowth trend, which were considerably reduced. H2 evolution during \nMg degradation was carefully monitored, which also served as a quan-\ntitative indicator of the in vitro magnesium corrosion rate. Fig. 1g clearly \nrevealed that BM/MgF 2 generated a burst release, particularly for the \nfirst 3 days, and it only slightly decreased with BM/PLA, which could \nresult in unfavorable gas cavity upon implantation. On the contrary, \nBM/PLAT/CP showed well-controlled, more sustainable hydrogen evo-\nlution, and the accumulative amount was only about half of that pro-\nduced from BM/PLA. In the extract, the Ca2\u0087concentration of DMEM \nmedium gradually decreased from 91.0 ppm to around 30.0 \u201340.0 ppm, \nwhich indicated slow-release manner of Ca2\u0087(Fig. S3). Moreover, the \nconcentration of Mg2\u0087ions in the extraction solution gradually \ndecreased as the coating thickness increases due to the additional CP \ncoating was engineered to enhance corrosion resistance as a physical \nbarrier, suggesting a retarded degradation provided by the bilayer \ncoating, in contrast to the bare substrate, and PLA coating alone \n(Fig. S4). According to ASTM G31-72 , the calculated in vitro corrosion \nrate of BM/PLAT/CP (0.201 \u00b10.005 mm/year) groups was markedly \nmodulated and significantly lower than those of the BM/MgF 2 and BM/ \nPLA groups. Notably, there was little interference in terms of degrada -\ntion with the incorporation of the Taxol drug into the composite coating \n(Fig. 1h). \nThe in vitro kinetic release profile of chemotherapeutic Taxol from \nthe BM/PLAT/CP implant over 2 weeks was plotted in Fig. 1i. The \namount of Taxol released from the BM/PLAT/CP implant was approxi -\nmately 52.5 % post 3 days and 91.0 % for the two weeks, in accordance \nwith a diffusion-controlled drug release mechanism by using a Higuchi \nmodel analysis [33]. It was noteworthy that the compact CP top layer \ndramatically alleviated the overfast release of Taxol in the early stage \nand subsequently regulated drug release kinetics [34]. These results \ndemonstrated that the BM/PLAT/CP implant showed promise in acting \nas a local drug delivery system for long-term use. 2.3. In vitro effect of the BM/PLAT/CP implant on osteosarcoma and \nosteoblastic cells \n2.3.1. In vitro biocompatibility and bioactivity on osteoblastic cells \nTo evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility and osteoconductivity of the \ncomposite implant, a direct osteoblastic cell adhesion assay was first \nperformed on different samples. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, slightly \nenhanced initial MC3T3-E1 cell adhesion was observed after 1 day of \nincubation in both the BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP groups compared to \nthat in control group (p D0.05). On Day 3 and Day 5, the two groups \nshowed adherent cell density comparable to that of the control group, \nalthough in the BM/PLAT/CP group it was slightly lower than that in the \nBM/CP without Taxol loading, revealing negligible influence of this \nTaxol-loaded coating on exacerbating osteoblast biocompatibility. In \ncontrast, the adherent live cells in the BM/MgF 2 group were signifi -\ncantly reduced, which exhibited a shrunk, roundish or abnormal \nmorphology, demonstrating acute cytotoxicity resulting from initial \nadhesion and subsequent cell growth. This difference may be predomi -\nnantly attributed to the rapid degradation of the Mg matrix, which \nlacked effective protection from the outermost brushite coating, thus \ninducing excessive Mg2\u0087, osmolality and possibly overhigh alkaline \nenvironment. The viabilities of MC3T3-E1 cells incubated with extracts \nof BM/MgF 2, BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP for 1, 3 and 5 days were dis-\nplayed in Fig. 2c. After culturing for 3 days, the BM/MgF 2 group clearly \npresented distinct toxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells, revealing poor viability of \n~56 %. Both the BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP groups exhibited good \ncytocompatibility for MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, achieving favorable \nviability of ~113 % and ~91 % on Day 5, respectively, thus meeting the \nbiocompatibility requirements of ISO10993-5 for clinical use. \nTo assess potential osteoinductivity in vitro, after 7 and 14 days of \nculture in differentiation medium, analysis of ALP activity demonstrated \nthat early osteogenic activity was strongly boosted in the BM/CP and \nBM/PLAT/CP groups, and there was no significant difference between \nthese two groups (Fig. 2d). Real-time PCR results after 14 days of culture \nwere shown in Fig. 2e. Similarly, compared with those in the Ti control \ngroup, Alp and Opn expressions in the BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP groups \nconsiderably elevated, and the Col I expression was also slightly greater \nin the BM/PLAT/CP group. Runx 2 expression was significantly upre-\ngulated in the BM/CP group, which was slightly higher compared to \nBM/PLAT/CP groups. These features indicated the prominent in vitro \nosteogenic potential of Mg-based implants achieved via this rational- \ndesigned bilayer coating system, with negligible influence of drug \nloading observed on osteoblast biocompatibility. \n2.3.2. In vitro cytotoxic effect on osteosarcoma cells \nTo explore the in vitro inhibitory effects of the Mg-based implants on \nosteosarcoma cells, direct cell adhesion and cell viability assays were \nperformed with MNNG cell line. The cell adhesion density, morphology \nand viability after 1, 3, and 5 days of culture are displayed in Fig. 3. \nDuring the entire culture period, compared with the control group, the \nadherent live cell density in the BM/PLAT/CP groups was significantly \nlessened, with cell morphology in the abnormal state, which was further \nminimized to almost 0 on Day 5, indicating a superior suppressive effect \nof BM/PLAT/CP on osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 3a and b). As for the BM/ \nMgF 2 group, the osteosarcoma cell density gradually decreased to 5.48 \n(cell/mm2) and was also much lower than that in the control group on \nDay 5, which was most probably attributed to the high osmolality, \nalkaline environment and burst H2 release associated with overfast Mg \nbiodegradation. Interestingly, for the BM/CP group, a reduced initial \ntumor cell adhesion was observed after 1 day of incubation, suggesting \ndistinct inhibition on osteosarcoma cell proliferation directly on the \nBM/CP surfaces. \nTo determine the possible effect of the released degradation products \non modulating tumor microenvironment (TME), the viability of MNNG \ncells incubated with extracts of different BM-based samples was detected \n(Fig. 3c). Throughout the entire assay, the extracts of the BM/MgF 2, BM/ Q. Guan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nBioactive Materials 40 (2024) 445\u2013459\n449CP and BM/PLAT/CP groups all exhibited significant inhibitory effects \non osteosarcoma cells and their proliferation. It should be noteworthy \nthat the antineoplastic effect of the extracts was not as significant as \nthose directly attached to the sample surface, and it thus may be mostly \nattributed to the local H2 evolution directly from the Mg-based samples, \nwhich was absent in the sample extracts. \n2.3.3. In vitro effect of Mg degradation microenvironment on differentiating \nosteoblast vs. osteosarcoma cells \nConsidering the high reaction activity of Mg in aqueous environ -\nments, to evaluate the effect of the degradation products of BM-based \ncomposite implants on differentiating viability of osteoblast and osteo -\nsarcoma cells was essential for rational design and appropriate control of \nMg degradation. In this study, the Mg biodegradation products consisted \nmainly of gaseous H2, Mg2\u0087and OH\u0000, which could be characterized by \nthe Mg2\u0087concentration, pH, and osmolality of the extract. To further \nexplore these degradation factors that may affect the viability of bone \ncells, BM extracts were prepared with a series of dilutions (100 % BM, 80 % BM, 50 % BM, and 20 % BM). The viability of MNNG osteosarcoma \ncells and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts cultured in the extracts for 1, 3 and 5 \ndays was displayed in Fig. 4a and b. The 100 % BM and 80 % BM extracts \nexhibited evident cytotoxic effects on both osteosarcoma and osteo -\nblastic cells, which could be due to the overhigh pH, osmolality and even \nMg2\u0087. Apparently, the osteoblastic cells bear effect of extract better than \nosteosarcoma cells, which exhibited ~86 % of cell viability on day 5 in \n80 % BM group. The conditions of 50 % BM exerted certain cytotoxic \neffect on osteosarcoma cells without inhibiting osteoblasts that the cell \nviability both exceeded 80 % on day 3 and 5. The 20 % BM extracts were \napproaching to the physiological conditions, thus showing limited \ninhibitory effect on osteosarcoma, but rather boosting osteoblast \nviability. Upon the incorporation of slight amount of Taxol, the viability \nof osteosarcoma cells cultured in BM/PLAT/CP extract decreased dras-\ntically, and meanwhile that of osteoblastic cells was still greater than 75 \n%, indicating the advantage of local Taxol delivery for BM-based com-\nposite implant in killing osteosarcoma cells meanwhile showing mini-\nmized side effect on osteoblasts.

Guan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nBioactive Materials 40 (2024) 445\u2013459\n450extracts and the cell viability results of MNNG osteosarcoma cells \ncultured in these extracts are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The pH, osmolality, \nand Mg2\u0087concentration of the BM extract gradually decreased with \nincreasing dilution ratio. The BM/PLAT/CP extracts exhibited lower pH \nvalues, osmolalities, and Mg2\u0087concentrations, whose values fell into \nthose between the 20 % and 50 % BM extracts, suggesting a favorable \nmodulation range of Mg degradation to exert cytotoxic effect on tumor \ncells whereas maintaining desirable osteoblast cytocompatibility \n(Fig. 4e). \n2.3.4. The mechanism of BM/PLAT/CP-induced osteosarcoma cytotoxicity \nThe complicated tumor microenvironment (TME) featured by acidic \npH values, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and vascular \nabnormalities may greatly limit the effect of tumor therapy [35,36]. \nRecent studies had provided evidence supporting the potent anticancer \ncapacity of gaseous H2, which may be attributed to the ability of a \nnumber of hydrogen molecules to entry into cells, thereby impairing the \nenergy supply crucial for the survival of cancer cells [37]. Moreover, \ncalcium ions (Ca2\u0087) also exerted significant influence on various tumor \ncell processes. Notably, in the context of elevated Ca concentrations, \ncalcium channels within cancer cells exhibited abnormal functionality, \nleading to an overload of calcium ions and subsequent mitochondrial \ndamage. This calcium-induced impairment significantly contributed to \nthe eradication of cancer cells [38]. To evaluate mitochondrial damage, \nwe employed the commercially available dye JC-1 to detect changes in \nthe mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The control group dis-\nplayed weak green fluorescence, while the BM group showed greatly \nincreased signals (Fig. 5a and b), indicating the H2 released from BM \ngreatly reduced MMP of tumors cells. The green fluorescence intensity \nfurther elevated in the BM/CP group, assumably due to the combined \neffect of H2 and Ca2\u0087stemmed from the composite Mg sample. Addi-\ntionally, PTX was used to induce oxidative stress, resulting in mito-\nchondrial damage. The BM/PLAT/CP group exhibited the most \nsignificant decrease in the MMP. \nTo further verify the uptake of Ca2\u0087by tumor cells, we investigated the intracellular Ca concentration using the Ca2\u0087probe Fluo-4 AM. \nFluorescence microscopy clearly revealed that, compared with the \ncontrol group, both the BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP groups exhibited \nenhanced green fluorescence, confirming the effect of overloaded Ca2\u0087. \nInterestingly, the BM/CP group exhibited even 1.02-fold stronger \nintracellular signals than that of the BM/PLAT/CP group, which could \nbe attributed to the release of PTX causing mitochondrial dysfunction \nand inhibiting intracellular Ca transport, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. The \ncytosol Ca2\u0087accumulation would stimulate oxidase activity of cells that \nwas responsible for ROS generation, and the process of Ca2\u0087-associated \nATP synthesis could also be restrained. Therefore, the intracellular ROS \nlevel was also detected and evaluated. Fig. 5e showed the elevated ROS \nlevel of MNNG tumor cells treated with BM/CP group. There was no \nstatistical difference between BM/CP and control groups. After co- \nculturing for 24 h, it can be observed that BM/CP group induced \nnearly double intracellular ROS production compared to the control \ngroup (p D0.05), which was most probably attributed to the accumu -\nlative Ca2\u0087products. Furthermore, the intracellular ATP content in the \nBM-related group displayed a similar downward trend (Fig. 5f), and the \nBM/PLAT/CP group exhibited the greatest decrease by 31 % in the MMP \nand 80 % in intracellular ATP level compared to control group respec -\ntively, suggesting that the generated H2 and Ca2\u0087were capable of killing \ncancer cells via inhibiting mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis. \nThis significant bioeffect can be attributed to the synergistic actions of \nMg degradation products and local Taxol release by destroying the TME, \nwhich thus resulted in excessive toxicity to osteosarcoma cells. Addi-\ntionally, Western Blot assays revealed significant upregulation of cyto-\nchrome C (Cyt-c) and downregulation of Bcl-2 in cells co-incubated with \nBM/PLAT/CP (Fig. 5g), which suggested the occurrence of multilevel \nmitochondrial damage, further confirming the dual therapeutic effects \nof calcium overloading and H2 release, ultimately leading to increased \nlevels of tumor cell apoptosis (Fig. 5h). \nFig. 3.In vitro killing effect on MNNG osteosarcoma cells. a) Fluorescent microscopy images and b) adherent cell density of MNNG osteosarcoma cells on control, \nBM/MgF 2, BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP samples, respectively.

In vivo effect of the BM/PLAT/CP implant on localized bone tumor \ntherapy \nTo assess in vivo antitumor efficacy, BM/CP, BM/PLAT45/CP, and \nBM/PLAT150/CP samples were implanted into the site adjacent to the \ninduced osteosarcoma of BALB/c nude mice (Fig. 6a). Saline and Taxol \nwere injected as the negative and positive controls, respectively. Pho-\ntographs of the tumors in the nude mice and changes in tumor volume at \npredetermined time intervals were presented in Fig. 6b\u2013d. During the 7- \nday observation, as the tumor growth was barely affected in the negative \ncontrol group, the largest tumor volume and the highest tumor growth \nrate were observed. Compared to the negative control group, the relative tumor growth rates in the free Taxol injection, BM/CP, BM/PLAT45/CP, \nand BM/PLAT150/CP groups decreased by 23.3 %, 15.5 %, 31.3 % and \n66.8 %, respectively. BM/CP, free Taxol injection and BM/PLAT45/CP \nall suppressed tumor growth, which was more prominent after 5 days. \nAmong all the groups, the BM/PLAT150/CP had the greatest inhibitory \neffect on tumor growth during the entire period, and the difference in \ntumor volume was not significant even after 7 days. Notably, even \nwithout Taxol loading, tumor growth was still inhibited in the BM/CP \ngroup, although to a slight extent, whose effect was actually similar to \nthat of the free Taxol injection group. This result therefore implied the \nsuppressive role of accumulative Mg biodegradation products and cal-\ncium overloading. With the incorporation of local Taxol delivery, BM- \nFig. 4.Viability results of a) MNNG cells vs. b) MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in the BM extracts with dilutions and BM/PLAT/CP extract. c, d) pH value, osmolality and \nMg2\u0087concentration of BM extracts with dilutions (100 % BM, 80 % BM, 50 % BM and 20 % BM) and BM/PLAT/CP extract. e) Schematic illustration on the effect of \ndegradation extracts of BM/PLAT/CP on differentiating viability between bone tissue cell and tumor cell.

Guan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nBioactive Materials 40 (2024) 445\u2013459\n452based composite implants could maintain considerable tumor inhibition \nefficacy owing to the co-existence of sustained Taxol release. In addition, \nthe tumor inhibition efficiency of BM/PLAT150/CP group was superior \nto that of conventional chemotherapy in the Taxol administration, \nindicating the advantage of local Taxol delivery, as well as the indis-\npensable role of microenvironment modulation induced by controlled \nMg degradation. \nAt the end of the experiment, tumor tissues were collected and \nevaluated via hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. Fig. 6e showed \nrepresentative tissue sections from the negative control, BM/CP, Taxol \ninjection, and BM/PLAT150/CP groups. No visible damage to the tumor \ntissue was observed in the negative control group. The BM/CP and Taxol \ninjection groups both revealed slight changes, and the BM/PLAT150/CP \nlocal treatment led to the most noticeable decrease in tumor cell \nnumbers and changes in cell morphology, in which massive cell nuclei \nwere dissolved and cell contact was loosened. The results of the quan-\ntitative analysis indicated that the tumor tissue necrosis rate reached 11.2 \u00b16.3 %, 39.4 \u00b16.0 %, and 67.4 \u00b15.2 % for the BM/CP, Taxol \ninjection, and BM/PLAT150/CP implant groups, respectively (Fig. 6f). It \ncan be clearly concluded that the tumor tissue necrosis rate followed the \norder of Control DTaxol injection \u226a BM/PLAT150/CP. The BM-based \ncomposite implant demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects on oste-\nosarcoma tumor-bearing mice, which was generally in accordance with \nthe in vitro response of MNNG osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 3). \n2.5.

The volume reduction in the BM/PLAT/CP \ngroup was slightly greater than that in the BM/CP group, about 9.56 %. \nThis difference was presumably due to the micro-defect in the PLA \ncoating after Taxol release, which slightly undermined the corrosion \nprotection of the Mg implant. According to the volume loss, the in vivo \ndegradation rate of the BM/PLAT/CP implant was determined of 0.46 \u00b1\n0.03 mm/year during the initial 8 weeks post-implantation. Subse -\nquently, the degradation rate slightly increased to 0.47 \u00b10.08 mm/year \nand 0.66 \u00b10.10 mm/year at 12 and 16 weeks post-surgery, respectively, \nwhich could sufficiently meet clinical requirements. \n2.5.2. Micro-CT evaluation of bone formation \nAs shown in Fig. 7e and f, the bone defects in the BM-based groups \nstarted to heal at 8 weeks post-surgery. Histomorphometric analysis of the newly formed bone tissues indicated that the BV/TV indices of the \nBM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP groups were both 1.3-fold greater than that of \nthe Ti group for the entire implantation period. No significant difference \n(p F0.5) was observed between the two BM-based groups. Moreover, \ncompared with those in the Ti group, the BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP \ngroups exhibited significant increment in trabecular number (Tb.N) and \ntrabecular thickness (Tb.Th), the values of which were 1.3 fold and 1.55 \nfold than Ti group respectively. and decreased trabecular spacing (Tb. \nSp) at 16 week. There was no significant difference between the BM/CP \nand BM/PLAT/CP groups. The trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) was decreased \nin BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP groups at 16 week (Fig. 7g). Taken \ntogether, these findings suggested that the incorporation of Taxol into \nBM-based implants, which ensured controlled drug release, had negli-\ngible adverse influence on the bone remodeling process during femoral \ndefect healing and thus results in outstanding bone-forming capability \nFig. 6.The anti-tumor effect of BM-based implant on osteosarcoma tumor-bearing mice. a) Schematic illustration of MNNG-bearing mice and therapeutic process of \nimplants. b) Tumor photographs of nude mice for the control, Taxol, BM/CP, Mg/PLAT45/CP, and Mg/PLAT150/CP groups at Day 0 and Day 7. c) Tumor volume \nand d) relative tumor volume change of five groups at each time point. e, f) H&E stained images of tumor tissue and tumor tissue necrosis rate for the control, Taxol, \nBM/CP, and Mg/PLAT150/CP groups. *p D0.05 vs. Control group. #p D0.05.

The continuity and thickness of \nthe trabeculae surrounding the BM-based implants continued to increase \nafter 8 weeks. As shown in Fig. 8b, at 16 weeks post-surgery, remarkably \nmore new bone was formed in the BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP groups, \nwhich was approximately 1.3-fold greater than that in the Ti group. \nNew bone formation around Ti, BM/CP, and BM/PLAT/CP implants \nwas recorded by using three fluorochromes. Bone formation at 16, 12, \nand 8 weeks post-surgery was analyzed via immune-fluorescent labeling (Fig. 8c and d). The percentage of the stained bone area in the BM/CP \nand BM/PLAT/CP groups was significantly greater than that in the Ti \ngroup at 8 and 12 weeks. The osteoinductivity effect was most apparent \nin both BM-based groups, indicating that the controlled release of Mg \nbiodegradation products was beneficial for inducing bone regeneration. \nThe percentage of stained bone area decreased overall, signifying the \noccurrence of bone remodeling at 16 weeks post-surgery. \nFig. 8.In vivo analysis of the new bone formation of implants. a) Histologic overview of Ti, BM/CP, and BM/PLAT/CP implanted in femoral defects and b) \nquantification of the new bone area and BIC at different weeks post-surgery.

Hence, in our \nstudy, a bilayer PLA/CP-coated Mg-based implant was developed as a \nlocal drug delivery system to achieve sustainable and controllable \nrelease of chemotherapeutic Taxol for weeks. Additionally, the \ncontrolled degradation processes facilitated the successful regeneration \nof bone tissue. Mg alloy implants can promote osteogenic differentiation \nand improve femur fracture healing, suggesting the potential thera -\npeutic effect of Mg in orthopedics [39]. Controlling the degradation of \nimplants is crucial not only for preventing premature mechanical fail-\nure, but also for circumventing negative effects of excessive Mg2\u0087on \nosteogenesis due to undesirable immunomodulation in macrophages \n[40] thus ensuring appropriate bone regeneration and remodeling. \nMoreover, overfast, burst release of H2 gas, an anti-tumor agent pro-\nvided with adequate, long-term application, could be also effectively \nharnessed. A bio-Mg alloy developed by our group was used as the \nsubstrate material [41], the mechanical strength (F200 MPa) and \nductility (min. 10 %) of which meet the requirement of implantation. \nThe Taxol-loaded PLA/CP-coated Mg-based implant significantly \nimproved the corrosion resistance of the substrate, the degradation rate \nof which is 0.201 mm/year in vitro. The incorporation of Taxol barely \naffected the degradation profile of the PLA/CP-coated BM implants. \nFurther micro-CT analysis of the in vivo data also confirmed that the \nBM/PLAT/CP implant maintained full structural integrity via surface \ndegradation during the 4-month bone defect healing process. The \ncalculated in vivo degradation rate of the BM/PLAT/CP implants was \nmuch higher than that measured in vitro (immersion in DMEM), and this \ndifference may be due to the combined influence of proteins, cells and \nthe in vivo dynamic body fluid environment, which would accelerate the \ndegradation of Mg-based implants [42]. The in vivo degradation rates of \nBM/PLAT/CP implants was less than 0.5 mm/year and significantly \nlower than that of the previously reported naked Mg implants [43]. The \nBM/PLAT/CP implants exhibited a favorable controlled degradation \nprofile with desirable uniform corrosion mode and no gas pockets \nobserved post-surgery, which could adequately meet clinical re-\nquirements for orthopedic implants applications [44]. \nThe treatment of bone tumors is a complex process which is regu-\nlated by various factors, including drug type and tumor microenviron -\nment, etc. We demonstrated that the BM/PLAT/CP implant had a \nremarkable tumor inhibition effect compared with that of the control \nand BM/CP implant. Compared to systemic administration/injection of \nhigh-dose Taxol, the BM/PLAT150/CP implant had a significantly \ngreater tumor inhibition rate even with a much lower Taxol loading, \nthereby revealing the distinct advantage of localized chemotherapy. In \naddition to local Taxol delivery, the degradation products of Mg-based \ncomposite implants could also inhibit tumor cells [45]. Studies have \nreported that alkaline environment can induce apoptosis and necrosis of \ntumor cells [46]. Meanwhile, gaseous H2 as a major degradation product \nof Mg can be also deployed as a therapeutic agent to restrain tumor \ngrowth [47]. Moreover, the abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of free \ncalcium ions (Ca2\u0087), contributed to damage and even cell death in tumor \ncell types by causing mitochondrial dysfunction [48]. Notably, in vitro \ncellular results of MNNG cells treated with BM/PLAT/CP implants \nconfirmed that PTX and H2 in combination with Ca2\u0087\noverloading-induced mitochondrial dysfunction cooperate with \nchemotherapeutic drug to achieve optimal triple inhibition effect of \nosteosarcoma cells by activating the Cyt-c pathway. \nIn our study, the cell viability results of MNNG cells and MC3T3-El \ncells confirmed that high-concentration extract of Mg strongly induced \ncytotoxicity for both tumor cells and osteoblastic cells by changing the \nTME, while low-concentration of which led to scarce tumor cells inhi-\nbition. Thus, it is vital to appropriately modulate Mg biodegradation to balance antitumor activity and bone tissue biocompatibility and \nosteoinductivity. Through facilely adjusting the preparation conditions, \nthe thickness and morphology of the coating were optimized to modu -\nlate the release of Mg biodegradation products in a controlled, sustain -\nable manner. The cell viability of MC3T3-El cells was obviously \nenhanced in BM/CP group. Interestingly, the cell viability of MNNG cells \ndecreased markedly in BM/CP and BM/PLAT/CP group. Calcium ions is \na key factor in multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, \nmetabolism, and death [49], it may be also related to the Ca2\u0087ions level \nof cells (Fig. 5). Kajander et al. showed that Ca stimulated early \npre-osteoblastic cells migration and motility to promote osteogenesis \n[50]. The CP coating was engineered to enhance corrosion resistance by \nblocking water diffusion and ion attack, while also promoting bioac -\ntivity [51]. During the initial 14 days of the immersion test, the release \nof Mg2\u0087was curtailed by the CP coating. Subsequently, the corrosion \nrate of the CP coating accelerated, surpassing that of BM/MgF 2, as \nindicated by a significant surge in Mg2\u0087release. By quantifying the \ndegradation product of BM/PLAT/CP implant, the results indicated \nMg2\u0087, Ca2\u0087and OH\u0000were released in a much slower and controlled \nmanner, resulting in a near-physiological condition with adequate pH, \nMg2\u0087and Ca2\u0087concentration, and osmolality for cell survival and \nproliferation due to the significant protection of PLAT/CP dual coating. \nThe controlled release of Mg2\u0087and Ca2\u0087had a synergistic effect, which \nwas more effective in promoting bone regeneration and repair than the \nuse of either Mg or Ca ions alone. Considering these factors, PLAT/CP \ncoating also provided a more favorable microenvironment for the sur-\nvival, proliferation, and function of osteoblastic cells. Overall, the syn-\nergistic effect of H2, calcium overload and Taxol as degradation of \nBM/PLAT/CP was demonstrated in tumor-associated bone defect ther-\napy, in which the side effects of Taxol release on osteoblastic cells could \nbe greatly mitigated, while the inhibition of tumor cells could be \nenhanced by appropriate administration of Mg biodegradation products. \nHowever, the in vitro cytotoxicity tests were detected without consid -\nering elimination of degradable products from implants via body cir-\nculation in vivo, which might lead to the difference between in vitro and \nin vivo [52]. According to the results in vivo, the elevated osteogenesis \neffect was apparent in BM/PLAT/CP group, as demonstrated in Figs. 7 \nand 8 (Micro-CT imaging, histomorphometry analyses and sequential \nfluorescent labeling observation), indicating that the controlled release \nof Mg biodegradation products was beneficial for inducing in vivo bone \nregeneration. \nOn the other hand, successful implantation for bone defect repair \nrelies on crucial osteointegration between the surface of the implant and \nthe remodeling bone [53]. In this work, the BM/PLAT/CP implant \nexhibited advantages in terms of osteointegration over the Ti implant for \nfixation of the femoral intercondylar defect. The bone volume sur-\nrounding the BM/PLAT/CP implant remained relatively greater than \nthat surrounding the Ti implant at each time point. Histological exam -\nination also demonstrated mature bone tissue ingrowth around the \nBM/PLAT/CP implants. Recently substantial evidence has demonstrated \ngood osteointegration and bone ingrowth around Bio-Mg alloy implants \n[54] or calcium phosphate biomaterials [55]. Thus, the enhanced oste-\nogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells by the \nBM/PLAT/CP implant may be mostly correlated to the bioactivity of \nmagnesium and calcium present in the substrate and the coating, which \ncontributed to osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity, demonstrated \nwith the significant enhancement of in vivo new bone formation. With \nthese favorable features, the BM/PLAT/CP implant showed great po-\ntential as an innovative, superior modality in the combined treatment of \ntumor-induced bone defects, though systematic studies of large-scale \nanimal assays and clinical trials in long term are required prior to its \ntranslation into clinical practice. \n4.Conclusion \nIn this study, to treat tumor-associated bone defect, a bifunctional Q.

The enhanced effi-\ncacy of the Mg-based implant strategy was verified through its syner -\ngetic biological functions of antitumor activity and promoted \nosteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. The excellent chemotherapeutic \neffect of this implant on killing bone tumor cells and restraining tumor \ngrowth in vivo, was associated with controlled release of degradation \nproducts of H2 and Ca2\u0087, along with the continuous modulation of TME, \nwhich effectively synergized the action of the local delivery of chemo -\ntherapeutic drug. Moreover, the well-orchestrated degradation of the \nimplant also led to significant enhancement of osteoinductivity and \nboosted bone formation in vivo. Thus, by leveraging controlled degra -\ndation of the Mg-based implants, it not only assured appropriate \ndegeneration of structural integrity throughout the bone healing pro-\ncess, but also contributed to the desirable bio-functions of promoted \nosteogenesis and tumor suppression, owing to the sustainable release of \ndegradation products. Hence, our study demonstrated excellent poten -\ntial of an innovative multifunctional Mg-based implant modality for \napplication in tumor-associated bone defect. \n5.Experimental section \n5.1.

Briefly, 200 mg of \nPLA and Taxol (60 mM) were dissolved in 5 mL of ethyl acetate. The \npreparation was subsequently performed according to previous methods \n[56]. The PLA layer and calcium phosphate (CP) coating were prepared \nsequentially by dip-coating and chemical solution deposition methods, \nrespectively, where simple UV activation treatment was applied to the \nPLA layer to enhance the heterogeneous nucleation of CP. Finally, a \nTaxol loading of 2.10 \u00b10.10 \u03bcg/mm2 was achieved for each sample. The \nresultant BM sample was designated as BM/PLAT/CP, and the BM \nsamples coated with calcium phosphate and PLA loaded with Taxol were \ndenoted as BM/CP and BM/PLAT, respectively. BM disc specimens were \nsubjected to in vitro studies, including extract preparation, immersion \ntests, and cellular response evaluations. BM disk specimens (\u04246 mm \u00d72 \nmm) were used for in vivo antitumor evaluation, and cylindrical speci -\nmens (\u04243.5 mm \u00d75 mm) were for in vivo degradation and osteogenesis \nevaluation. \n5.2. Sample characterizations \nThe samples were embedded in poly (methyl methacrylate) to obtain \ncross-sections for analysis. The surface and cross-section of the samples \nwere ground, starting from 300 to 7000 grits, using SiC paper. The \nsamples were subsequently examined under a scanning electron mi-\ncroscope (SEM-EDS, JSM-7800 F Prime, Japan) to assess the coating \nthickness and structure integrity. BM/PLAT/CP was subjected to the \n\u201cTape Test\u201d in accordance with the ASTM D3359-97 standard proced -\nure. A 3 M scotch transparent tape (44 N/100 mm) was utilized to attach \nonto the cross-hatch pattern area on the test specimen followed by a \nquick removal of the tape. The interfacial adhesion level of the coating \nwas assessed by comparing the ratio of the defected/detached region to \nthe total area of the initial cross-hatch pattern. This resulted in a grading \nscale from 0 B (the least adhesion) to 5 B (the highest adhesion). \n5.3. In vitro degradation of the implant \nThe samples were incubated in DMEM (Gibco, USA) at 37 \u2022C and 5 % CO2 for 60 days. The concentration of Mg2\u0087in the extract was deter -\nmined using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrom -\neter (icap6300, USA). Additionally, the pH was measured with a pH \nmeter (FE20, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland), and the osmolality was \nassessed via an osmometer (Osmolality 3000, Gonotec, Germany). The \nin vitro biodegradation rate of Mg was meticulously calculated by \nanalyzing the weight variances. Upon completion of the immersion test, \nthe samples were extracted from the medium and examined using SEM\u2012 \nEDS. \n5.4. In vitro drug release \nThe BM/PLAT/CP construct was carefully immersed in a solution of \nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH \u00887.4) with 1.0 % v/v of Tween 20 \nwithin a shaking incubator (120 rpm, 37 \u2022C). At specific time intervals, \n2 mL of the medium was meticulously extracted for analysis through a \nUV/Vis spectrophotometer (UH5300, Hitachi, Japan) at the character -\nistic wavelength of 228 nm, after which the medium was promptly \nreplaced with an equal volume of fresh medium. \n5.5. Cellular experiments \n5.5.1. Preparation of extracts \nAseptic samples were immersed in \u03b1-MEM (Gibco, USA), enriched \nwith 10 % FBS (Gibco, USA), and incubated for 3 days to procure the \nextracts. The ratio of sample area to medium volume adhered to the ISO \n10993-5 standard and was set at 1.25 cm2/mL. \n5.5.2. Cell adhesion, viability and proliferation assays \nMNNG or MC3T3-E1 cells (1 \u00d7104 cells/well) were seeded in 24- \nwell plates containing aseptic samples. The plates were incubated for \n1, 3, or 5 days. Following the incubation period, the adherent cells were \nrinsed with PBS, subsequently stained with a Live/Dead staining kit \n(Thermo Fisher, USA) for 15 min and observed via fluorescence mi-\ncroscopy (IX71, Olympus, Japan). MNNG or MC3T3-E1 cells were \nseeded in a 96-well plate overnight and then incubated with sample \nextracts for 1, 3 or 5 days. The CCK8 assay (DOJINDO, Japan) was used \nto detect the viability and proliferation of MNNG cells. \n5.5.3. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression \nAdherent MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated with sample extracts \nsupplemented with 100 nM of dexamethasone (Sigma, USA), 50 \u03bcM \nascorbic acid (Sigma, USA), or 10 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA) \nfor 7 or 14 days. The ALP activity was measured using pNPP as the \nsubstrate at 415 nm. The OD values were normalized to the total protein \nconcentration (via a BCA Protein Assay Kit). \n5.5.4. Real-time PCR analysis \nThe mRNA expression levels of Alp, Opn, Col I, and Runx 2 were \nassessed, with GAPDH serving as the reference gene. In brief, 1 \u00d7104 \nMC3T3-E1 cells/well were cultured with the extract for 14 days. Total \nRNA was isolated from the MC3T3-E1 cells using TRIzol reagent \n(Ambion, Life Technologies, USA), and cDNA was synthesized using \nReverTra Ace- \u03b1- (TOYOBO, Japan). The resulting cDNA was subse -\nquently amplified using SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix \n(TOYOBO, Japan). RT\u2012PCR analysis was conducted using a CFX96 \nTouch RT\u2012PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) following the manu -\nfacturer \u2019s protocol. The primer sequences for Alp, Opn, Col I, Runx 2, \nand GAPDH can be found in Table S1. \n5.5.5. Effect of magnesium degradation products on cells \nExtracts of naked BM samples at different dilutions (100 %, 80 %, 50 \n%, and 20 % conc.) were prepared to estimate the effect of magnesium \nbiodegradation products on cells. MC3T3-E1 or MNNG cells were seeded \nin 96-well plates at a density of 2 \u00d7103 cells/well. The procedure for \ndetermining cell viability was the same as that described in Section Q. Guan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nBioactive Materials 40 (2024) 445\u2013459\n4585.5.2 . \n5.5.6. Measurement of Ca2\u0087ion levels and mitochondrial dysfunction in \nosteosarcoma cells \nMNNG cells were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7105 cells/well in a 24- \nwell Transwell plate and cultivated with complete \u03b1-MEM (1 mL per \nwell) in a cell incubator. After 12 h of cell attachment, the sterile sam-\nples were placed in the upper chamber of a 24-well plate. After 2 h, the \nmitochondrial membrane potential probe (DOJINDO, Japan) or Ca ion \nprobe (Thermo Fisher, USA) was added, the mixture was incubated for \n15 min and rinsed with \u03b1-MEM 3 times. Subsequently, the cells were \ndetected by fluorescence microscopy (IX71, Olympus, Japan). The mean \nvalues of fluorescence intensity were obtained by a microplate reader. \n5.5.7. Western blot analysis \nTo analyze the underlying anti-tumor mechanisms, MNNG cells were \nincubated in 6-well plates at a density of 2 \u00d7105 cells per well for 12 h, \nand the sterile samples were placed in the upper chamber of a 6-well \nplate. After 24 h, respectively. The expression of Bcl-2 (ab182858, \n1:2000) and Cyt-c (ab133504, 1:5000, Abcam, UK) was analyzed via WB \n(Image Tanon-5200 Multi). \n5.5.8. Measurement of ROS level in MNNGs cells \nMNNGs cells were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7105 cells/well in 24- \nTranswell plate. After 12 h for cell attachment, the sterile samples \nwere placed in the upper chamber of the 24-transwell plate. After in-\ncubation for 2 h and 24 h, respectively, the culture medium was replaced \nwith \u03b1-MEM containing 0.1 % DCFH-DA probe, incubated for 15 min, \nand observed with the fluorescence microscope (IX71, Olympus, Japan). \nThe mean ROS values were obtained by ImageJ software based on the \nfluorescence intensities. The normalized ROS values were calculated as \nfollows: \nNormalized ROSvalue\u0088Mean fluorescent intensityECellnumber  \n5.6. In vivo animal experiments \n5.6.1. Animals \nAll animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines \napproved by the Animal Research Committee of the Sixth People \u2019s \nHospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. SD rats (3 months old) and \nBALB/c nude mice (5 weeks old) (Shanghai Sippr-BK Laboratory Animal \nCo. Ltd., Shanghai, China) were used. \n5.6.2. In vivo antitumor evaluation \nBM disc samples from the MNNG osteosarcoma model were sub-\njected to in vivo antitumor evaluation. A suspension containing 1 \u00d7107 \nof MNNG osteosarcoma cells was subcutaneously injected into BALB/c \nnude mice, which reached a volume of approximately 200 mm3. Sterile \nsamples were implanted next to the tumor. The mice were divided into \nfive groups (10 mice in each group): control (saline injection), Taxol \ninjection (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection), BM/CP implantation, \nBM implant loading ca. 45 \u03bcg g of Taxol (BM/PLAT45/CP), and BM \nimplant loading ca. 150 \u03bcg of Taxol (BM/PLAT150/CP). The tumor \nvolume (VTumor ) at each time point was calculated according to the \nfollowing formula:  \nVTumor \u0088Length Tumor \u00d7Width Tumor2/2                                                  \nV0 refers to the initial tumor volume. The relative tumor size was \ncalculated as VTumor /V0. The nude mice were sacrificed 1 week post- \nsurgery. The tumors were obtained, stained with hematoxylin & eosin \n(H&E) and finally examined to visualize the tumor tissue under an op-\ntical microscope. \n5.6.3. In vivo osteogenesis \nBM cylindrical samples were used for in vivo osteogenic evaluation. Bone regeneration was estimated in SD rats by establishing a critical- \nsized femoral defect model. Sterile samples were implanted into the \ncreated bone defects (\u04243.5 mm \u00d76 mm). The incisions were closed in \nlayers. The polychrome sequential fluorescent labeling method was \nemployed to assess new bone formation and mineralization. At 21, 14, \nand 7 days before the animals were sacrificed, fluorochromes were i. p. \nadministered in a specific sequence of 20 mg/kg calcein, 30 mg/kg \nalizarin red S and 25 mg/kg tetracycline hydrochloride (Sigma \u2012Aldrich, \nUSA), respectively. As an accurate analyzing technique, micro-CT was \nperformed to evaluate bone defect healing and in vivo degradation. 3D \nimages were reconstructed based on 2D microtomography images using \nAmira (Visualization Science Group, USA). \nSD rats were sacrificed at 8, 12, and 16 weeks post-surgery. After \nmicro-CT analysis, femur specimens were dehydrated, embedded, cut \ninto 150 \u03bcm-thick sections and polished to obtain a final thickness of \n~50 \u03bcm. CLSM (Leica, TCS SP8 STED 3X, Germany) was used to observe \nthe fluorescence. The sections were then counterstained with Van Gie-\nson\u2019s picrofuchsin, and the mineralized bone tissue was examined under \nan optical microscope. The images were analyzed using ImageJ (version \n6.0). The percentage of bone-implant contact ratio (BIC) was determined \nas follows: \nBIC\u0088bone contact lengthEimplant length within onepitch\u00d7100%  \n5.6.4. In vivo degradation \nMicro-CT was conducted to detect the degradation of the BM-based \nsamples in rats according to the volume loss. The residual volumes of \nthe BM-based samples at 8, 12, and 16 weeks post-surgery were calcu -\nlated via 3D remodeling through the use of a threshold of gray values. \n5.7. Statistical analysis \nAll data were expressed as mean \u00b1standard deviation from at least \nthree independent experiments. The results were analyzed via Student \u2019s \nt-test or ANOVA using SPSS software vc9 (IBM, USA). p D0.05 was \nconsidered to be statistically significant. \nEthics approval and consent to participate \nAnimal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Exper -\nimental Committee of the Sixth People \u2019s Hospital affiliated to School of \nMedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SYSK2021-0020). \nDeclaration of competing interest \nThe authors declare no competing financial interest. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nQingqing Guan: Writing \u2013 review & editing, Writing \u2013 original draft, \nVisualization, Methodology, Investigation, Conceptualization.
