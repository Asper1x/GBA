Introduction\nThe management of food waste and by-products has become a challenge for the\nagri-food sector (agriculture, farming, and food processing activities), which tackles de-\nmanding economic costs for their treatment/disposal, stemming from the increase in food\ndemand/consumption as well as the rigorous environmental regulations. In particular,\nthe dairy industry annually produces millions of tons of by-products, with whey being\none of the main components (global production of ~200 million tonnes). Because of its\nhigh biological oxygen demand and important organic (lactose) and inorganic (mineral\nsalts, mainly sodium chloride and potassium chloride) nutritional load, whey can cause\nserious environmental problems (e.g., in aquatic life) if discarded without appropriate\ntreatments [ 1\u20133]. Whey is mainly composed of water (92%), milk nutrients such as lac-\ntose (5%), proteins (1%) (e.g., \f-lactoglobulin, \u000b-lactoglobulin, immunoglobulins, serum\nalbumin, and lactoferrin), minerals (1%), fat/lipids (0.1%), and vitamins (B vitamins) [ 4].\nBecause whey is a nutrient- and protein-rich compound, around 50% of whey is used as is\nor in a dry (concentrate or isolate) state to obtain high-added-value compounds for food,\npharmaceutical, and chemical industries. However, a high proportion of this by-product is\nstill being wasted/discarded as ef\ufb02uent [1,2,5,6].\nSeeking other whey valorisation alternatives and applications, this work is focused on\nthe development of novel biopolymer-based \ufb01lms, aiming at replacing currently used food\nPolymers 2023 ,15, 387. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15020387 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023 ,15, 387 2 of 14\npackaging plastics by greener packaging \ufb01lms, which can be employed to maintain the\nquality characteristics and extend the shelf life of foodstuffs while having environmental\nadvantages (waste valorisation and biodegradability) over conventional packaging plastics.\nAs a potential approach to improve \ufb01lm properties, such as water resistance and mechanical\nproperties, polyols can be used as plasticisers to prepare \ufb02exible \ufb01lms [ 7,8], with glycerol\nbeing the plasticiser used in this work to develop whey-protein-based food packaging.\nAnother way to improve \ufb01lm properties is the inclusion of ascorbic acid (AA), a widely\nused natural and generally recognised as a safe (GRAS) food ingredient [ 9,10], which can\nact as a bioactive compound.\nIn this study, glycerol-plasticised \ufb01lms were prepared using whey protein isolate (WPI)\nand their properties were assessed as a function of added AA content. Physicochemical,\nthermal, barrier, optical, and mechanical properties of the \ufb01lms were analysed and related\nto the \ufb01lm structure. In addition, the environmental assessment of the \ufb01lms was carried\nout to evaluate the impact of \ufb01lm manufacturing.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Materials\nWhey protein isolate (WPI) was provided by Nutrition Chefs (Donostia-San Sebastian,\nSpain) and its amino acid analysis was performed with a Biochrom 30+ amino acid analyser\nphysiological system (UK). Glycerol (Gly) was purchased from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain)\nand ascorbic acid (AA) from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). Milli-Q ultrapure water\n(Madrid, Spain) was used as the solvent.\n2.2. Film Preparation\nCompression moulding was used to prepare WPI \ufb01lms but a previous step was\nperformed to adjust the pH to 10. The reason for adjusting the pH of the \ufb01lm-forming\nsolution to 10 was to avoid the isoelectric point (pI) of WPI (pI~5). Lower/higher pH values\nthan the pI of whey proteins result in +/ \u0000charged proteins, which enable the development\nof repulsive electrostatic forces. The greater the distance between pH and pI, the stronger\nthe repulsive forces formed; thus, the aggregation of proteins is prevented, which leads to\nmore transparent solutions/\ufb01lms [9,11].\nAmounts of 10 g of WPI and 5, 10, or 15 wt% of AA (based on a WPI dry basis) were\ndissolved in 100 mL of Milli-Q ultrapure water at 80\u000eC and stirred at 200 rpm for 30 min.\nThen, Gly was added (50 wt% on a WPI dry basis), the pH was adjusted to 10 (NaOH 1 M),\nand the solution was heated at 80\u000eC for other 30 min under magnetic stirring. Afterwards,\nthe solution was freeze-dried for 48 h using an Alpha 1\u20134 LDplus freeze-drier (INYCOM,\nZaragoza, Spain), and the obtained powder was thermally compacted (3 MPa, 2 min)\nusing a Specac hydraulic press, previously heated up to 105\u000eC. The obtained \ufb01lms were\ndesignated as Control, AA5, AA10, and AA15 for those samples prepared with 0, 5, 10, and\n15 wt% of AA, respectively. All \ufb01lms were conditioned (25\u000eC, 50% RH, 48 h) before testing\nin an ACS Sunrise 700 V bio-chamber.\n2.3. Film Characterisation\n2.3.1. Film Thickness\nA Mitutoyo hand-held QuantuMike digimatic (Unceta, Elgoibar, Spain) micrometer\nwas used to measure \ufb01lm thickness to the nearest 0.001 mm ( n= 3).\n2.3.2. Attenuated Total Re\ufb02ectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy\nATR-FTIR spectra from 4000 to 750 cm\u00001were performed with a 4 cm\u00001resolution\nusing a Bruker ALPHA II FTIR spectrometer (Barcelona, Spain).\nPolymers 2023 ,15, 387 3 of 14\n2.3.3. Water Uptake (WU)\nWU capacity of the \ufb01lms was calculated by immersing preweighed ( W0) samples\n(2 cm2) in distilled water (50 mL). The samples were weighed again ( Wt) at \ufb01xed times to\nobtain the WU curves of the \ufb01lms ( n= 3). WU was calculated as follows:\nWU (%) =(Wt\u0000W0)\nW0\u0002100. (1)\n2.3.4. Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)\nTGA (Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851, Madrid, Spain) was performed from 25 to\n800\u000eC and DSC (Mettler Toledo DSC 822) from 5 to 180\u000eC. Both assays were carried out at\n10\u000eC/min under a N 2atmosphere to avoid oxidation reactions.\n2.3.5. Colour and Gloss\nA Minolta CR-400 Chroma Meter was used to measure ( n= 10) colour parameters\n(CIELAB scale): L* = 0 (black) to L* = 100 (white), \u0000a* (greenness) to + a* (redness), and \u0000b*\n(blueness) to + b* (yellowness) using a white tron ( L* = 97.39, a* = 0.03, and b* = 1.77). The\ntotal colour difference ( DE*), referred to as the Control \ufb01lm, was measured as follows:\nDE\u0003=q\n(DL\u0003)2+ (Da\u0003)2+ (Db\u0003)2(2)\nA Minolta Multi Gloss 268 plus gloss meter was employed to measure gloss ( n= 10) at\na 60\u000eincidence angle, according to ASTM D-523.\n2.3.6. Light Absorbance\nA V-630 Jasco (Madrid, Spain) ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was\nused for the measurement of the light absorbance from 200 to 800 nm.\n2.3.7. Water Contact Angle (WCA)\nAn OCA Dataphysics contact angle meter was used to measure WCA ( n= 5) by\ndropping 3 \u0016L of distilled water onto the \ufb01lm surface. Images were captured at 0 and 5 min\nusing SCA20 software.\n2.3.8. Water Vapour Permeability (WVP)\nA Labthink PERME \u2122W3/0120 instrument was employed to determine WVP gravi-\nmetrically ( n= 3) at 38\u000eC and 90% RH, according to ASTM E96-00. Each \ufb01lm was cut in\nsamples of 7.4 cm diameter (test area of 33 cm2). First, the water vapour transmission rate\n(WVTR ) was calculated as:\nWVTR\u0010g\ns\u0001cm2\u0011\n=G\nt\u0002A(3)\nwhere Gis the weight change ( g),tis time (h), and Ais the test area ( cm2). Then, water\nvapour permeability ( WVP ) was determined as:\nWVP\u0010g\ncm\u0001s\u0001Pa\u0011\n=WVTR \u0002L\nDP(4)\nwhere Lis the \ufb01lm thickness (mm) and DPis the partial pressure difference of water vapour\nacross the \ufb01lm.\n2.3.9. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\nA Hitachi S-4800 (Madrid, Spain) scanning electron microscope was used with\nan acceleration voltage of 15 kV to visualise the film cross-sectional morphology.\nSamples were placed in a metallic stub and coated with gold under vacuum in an\nargon atmosphere.\nPolymers 2023 ,15, 387 4 of 14\n2.3.10. X-ray Diffraction (XRD)\nA PANalytic Xpert Pro (Madrid, Spain) equipment with a diffraction unit and Cu-K \u000b\n(\u0015= 1.5418 \u00c5) as a radiation source was used to carry out XRD analysis at 40 kV and 40 mA\nfrom 2 \u0012= 2.5 to 50.0\u000e.\n2.3.11. Tensile Tests\nAn Instron 5967 electromechanical testing system (Barcelona, Spain) was used to\nperform tensile tests. Films were cut with a bone shape of 4.75 mm \u000222.25 mm. A\ntensile load of 500 N and a crosshead rate of 1 mm/min were used to measure mechanical\nproperties ( n= 10) according to ASTM D638-03.\n2.3.12. Environmental Assessment\nSimaPro 9.2.0.1 software (Barcelona, Spain) was used to assess the \ufb01lm manufacture\nenvironmental impact following the ISO 14040 guidelines and recommendations; the\nEcoinvent v3 database was used to obtain the data of energy production, transport, and\nproduction of chemicals; the Hierarchist version of ReCiPe 2016, midpoint (H) v1.05, was\nused to calculate the environmental impacts associated with the \ufb01lm manufacture. First, the\nfunctional unit was selected as 10 g of WPI. Then, in the inventory stage, the materials used\n(WPI, NaOH, glycerol, and water) and the energy (electricity) consumed were considered.\nAs the \ufb01lm manufacture was performed at lab-scale, electricity consumption was estimated\nby our group. In addition, distilled water production and its transportation to the waste\ntreatment plant after use were considered.\n2.4. Statistical Analysis\nSPSS Statistic 25.0 was used to carry out a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nwith the level of signi\ufb01cance set at p< 0.05, determined by post hoc multiple comparisons\nthrough Tukey\u2019s test.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Amino Acid Content in WPI\nA complete overview of the amino acid (aa) pro\ufb01le as expressed in % is presented in\nTable 1. The glutamic acid (16.6 %), aspartic acid (11.6%), alanine (9.5%), and leucine (9.1%)\ncontents were the aa with the highest presence in the studied WPI, while arginine (0.9%),\nhistidine/cysteine (1.4%), and methionine (1.7%) were present in the lowest percentages.\nThe WPI used in this study was richer in serine, glycine, proline, and alanine; contained\nsimilar percentages of methionine, phenylalanine, histidine, and tyrosine; was poorer in\narginine compared with other whey proteins [ 12\u201314]. It has been seen that differences in\namino acid percentages, sequences, and charges may affect the \ufb01nal material properties [ 15].\nTable 1.

Physicochemical Properties of Films\nAll WPI \ufb01lms were of uniform thickness, as seen in Table 2, as \ufb01lm thickness (~120 \u0016m)\ndid not change signi\ufb01cantly ( p> 0.05) with the increase in AA content from 0 to 15 wt%. The\nmaintenance of \ufb01lm thickness after AA addition indicated a good compatibility between\nAA and WPI [16].\nTable 2.

As can be seen in Figure 1a, the spectra displayed signals\naround 3280 cm\u00001, 2925 cm\u00001, and 2875 cm\u00001, attributed to O-H and stretch vibrations\nof C-H (CH 2and CH 3), respectively. WPI showed the typical bands of proteins around\n1635 cm\u00001, 1540 cm\u00001, and 1230 cm\u00001assigned to C=O stretching (amide I band), N-H\nbending (amide II band), and C-N stretching (amide III band), respectively [ 17,18]. Signals\naround 940\u20131150 cm\u00001were associated with the C-O stretching of carbohydrates [ 19],\npresent in whey proteins [ 20]. The main absorption bands of Gly were related to the\nvibrations of C\u2013C and C\u2013O bonds in the 850\u20131350 cm\u00001region [ 21]. Finally, the bands at\n1764, 1675, and 1200\u20131500 cm\u00001were associated with C=O stretching, C=C stretching, and\nC-H deformations of AA, respectively [22].\nPolymers 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 15 \n \n  \nFigure 1.

Thermal Properties\nThe thermal properties of WPI films were determined via TGA and DSC analyses\n(Figure 3). DTGA curves (Figure 3a) revealed four distinct regions of weight loss changes,\nirrespective of AA content. First, water evaporation from the films was observed up\nto 100\u000eC. Second, the degradation of low-molecular-weight protein components and\nglycerol occurred between 100 and 200\u000eC, suggesting interactions (e.g., H-bonds) be-\ntween WPI and glycerol as this second stage appeared at temperatures higher than the\nglycerol boiling point (182\u000eC). Third, the degradation of high-molecular-weight protein\nfractions took place around 250\u000eC. In this stage, the DTG peak slightly shifted to lower\ntemperatures as the AA concentration increased. These results could indicate that AA\nbehaves similar to a plasticiser. Finally, the oxidation of partially decomposed proteins\nand degradation of impurities in whey protein were observed around 320\u000eC. Degrada-\ntion temperatures/stages of WPI are in agreement with the literature data obtained for\nother WPI-based materials [27\u201330].\nRegarding DSC results, two distinct regions could be observed (Figure 3b): (i) a\nsmall endothermic peak at around 100\u000eC, attributed to water evaporation, and (ii) a\nmajor endothermic transition at the region of 225\u2013275\u000eC. This latter was related to the\nvolatilisation of glycerol as well as to the destruction of ordered molecular structures and\nthermal decomposition of polypeptide chains. The addition of AA led to slight shifts\nin the second endothermic peak towards lower temperatures, indicating that there were\ninteractions between WPI and AA that could induce some structural modi\ufb01cations in the\nprotein. AA might act as a plasticiser, leading to these slight changes [11].\nPolymers 2023 ,15, 387 7 of 14\nPolymers 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 15 \n \n 3.3.

This latter was related to the volatilisa-\ntion of glycerol as well as to the destruct ion of ordered molecular structures and thermal \ndecomposition of polypeptide chains. The addition  of AA led to slight shifts in the second \nendothermic peak towards lower temperatures, indicating that there were interactions \nbetween WPI and AA that could induce some st ructural modifications in the protein. AA \nmight act as a plasticiser, leading to these slight changes [11]. \n3.4. Optical Properties \nThe optical properties of the films were a ssessed based on the colour and gloss pa-\nrameters (Table 3). The addition of AA induced significant differences in the brightness, \nredness, and yellowness of films as L* values decreased while a* and b* values increased \nwith AA incorporation. The same trend was observed in AA-containing unripe banana \nstarch films [31]. These colour parameter variations led to notable changes in \u0394E*, as com-\npared to Control films, with the difference be ing higher as the AA concentration increased \n(Table 3 and Figure 4). Matta and colleagues  observed the same outcomes when AA was \nincorporated in methylcellulose-based films [ 32]. The present results are also consistent \nwith Agudelo-Cuartas and co-workers [33] who observed that the incorporation of \u03b1-to-\ncopherol into whey protein concentrate films increased the \u0394E* values of films. \nFigure 3.

In the present study,  WPI films presented gloss values of around \n23 G.U. and AA addition did not have a significant ( p > 0.05) effect on the film gloss (Table \n3). This means that film surfaces remained rough after AA addition, which could be re-\nlated to hydrophobic surfaces as rough surfaces present a high surface area, which results \nin hydrophobic faces [35]. \n3.5. Barrier Properties \nThe barrier properties of the films were as sessed based on light absorbance capacity, \nwater contact angle, and water vapour permeability. The light absorbance capacity of all \nfilms is shown in Figure 5. Control films presented high barrier properties between 200 \nnm and 400 nm (UV region) due to the high co ntent of aromatic amino acids in WPI that \ncan absorb UV light [33]. The addition of AA not only notably improved the UV light \nabsorbance capacity of WPI film s but also extended the light protection above 500 nm (Vis \nregion). A similar trend was observed in star ch films with the incorporation of AA [31], \nand it was suggested that AA addition confe rred opacity, which provided a better barrier \nagainst the light. In our study, changes in optical properties were also observed (Figure 4 \nand Table 3), resulting in films with better UV -Vis light protection. Considering that the \nemitted UV-Vis light may induce food oxidation, especially in high-lipid foodstuffs, the films prepared in this study, particularly AA10 and AA15 films, could have potential for \nfood packaging to delay lipid oxidation caused by UV-Vis light [28]. \nFigure 4.

As shown in the literature [37], AA also affected the wettability of po-\ntato starch films as WCA values decreased with AA addition. Despite the WCA value \ndecrease, all films remained hydrophobic (WCA > 90\u00b0) at 0 min, which could be related to film roughness, while they became hydrophilic after 5 min (WCA < 90\u00b0), regardless of AA \nconcentration.

This insignificant increase could be related to the fact that AA contains a large amount of OH groups  that promoted the water vapour diffusion \nFigure 5.

Film Structure\nFilm structure was assessed using SEM and XRD techniques. SEM images of the\n\ufb01lm cross-section can be seen in Figure 6. In general, a continuous and homogeneous\nmicrostructure without any pores was observed in \ufb01lms without AA (Control) and with\n5 wt% AA (AA5), as can be seen in Figure 6a,b. This view slightly changed after the\ninclusion of 10 wt% AA as few small granules could be observed in AA10 \ufb01lms (Figure 6c).\nAs the AA content increased (AA15), the presence of these granules increased (arrows in\nFigure 6d). Similar results were observed in ferulic-acid-containing soy-protein-isolate-\nbased \ufb01lms, where aggregations were formed when high amounts of ferulic acid were\nadded [ 40]. Structure changes in gelatin \ufb01lms from rabbit skin were also observed when\nrosemary acid was incorporated [ 41]. The observed structure modi\ufb01cations were related\nto protein\u2013polyphenol interactions and protein self-aggregation induced by the excessive\nferulic acid/rosemary acid addition into protein-based \ufb01lms. The incorporation of increased\nAA concentrations in this work affected the morphology of WPI \ufb01lms in the same manner.\nIn XRD diffractograms, sharp peaks are related to the crystalline fractions of the\nanalysed material, while a broad and diffuse background represents the amorphous parts\nof the studied sample [ 42]. Considering that the \ufb01lms assessed in the present work exhibited\na typical amorphous diffraction pattern (Figure 7): a small and broad peak around 2 \u0012= 10\u000e\nand a more intensive less-broaden peak around 2 \u0012= 20\u000e, similar patterns were observed in\nother WPI \ufb01lms, such as for WPI and xylan composite \ufb01lms [ 30]. Regarding AA addition,\nXRD patterns did not change when AA was present in \ufb01lms, regardless of its content. Some\nstudies have shown that interactions between WPI and vitamins (AA is vitamin C) may\nnot affect the tertiary structure of WPI [23].\n3.7. Mechanical Properties\nThe addition of AA increased EB signi\ufb01cantly ( p< 0.05), but decreased signi\ufb01cantly\n(p< 0.05) EM and TS values, as shown in Table 5. This was because AA is a small molecule,\nconsisting of multiple hydroxyl groups, which could behave as a plasticiser, disrupting\nH-bonds between neighbouring protein chains [ 43]. Higher AA contents led to further\nchanges due to interactions between polymer networks being further reduced. A similar\ntrend was observed in WPI/cassava starch \ufb01lms where TS decreased and EB increased due\nto the plasticising effect of starch [ 17]. Similarly, whey-protein-based \ufb01lms incorporated\nwith natamycin and \u000b-tocopherol were less resistant/stiff and more stretchable \ufb01lms with\nthe addition of the active compounds [ 33]. Further, the addition of low-molecular-weight\ngalactooligosaccharide and xylooligosaccharide had a similar effect on WPI \ufb01lms, related\nPolymers 2023 ,15, 387 10 of 14\nto the development of an intermolecular spacing effect within WPI chains, similar to that\nobserved when plasticisers are used [16].\nPolymers 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15 \n \n through the film [17]. However, WVP values did not change significantly, as also seen in \nthe literature on whey protein concentrate/pu llulan composite films containing a bacteri-\nophage [39]. \n3.6.

Environmental Assessment\nThe main goal of the environmental assessment carried out in this study was to eval-\nuate the environmental impact of WPI \ufb01lm manufacture to identify the environmental\nload related to each process of turning raw materials into \ufb01lms. In this context, the energy\nconsumed in the manufacturing stages and the materials used to prepare \ufb01lms were con-\nsidered as inputs to determine the environmental burden related to each process in the\nproduction of WPI \ufb01lms at lab-scale. As shown in Figure 8, freezing and freeze-drying\nprocesses were the main contributors (95%) to the impact load. The energy used in these\nprocesses, speci\ufb01cally electricity consumption, had a critical role in the environmental\nimpact, regardless of the impact category. The environmental assessment identi\ufb01ed these\ntwo processes as the most relevant indicators. In addition to them, the use of glycerol\nrepresented around 5% of the environmental impact in both land use and marine eutrophi-\ncation categories. This was because glycerol is a co-product in the esteri\ufb01cation process of\nsoybean oil production to obtain biodiesel.

Thus, when glycerol was added into the \ufb01lm-forming\nformulation, the impacts of soybean cultivation (e.g., use of diesel, machines, fertilisers,\nand pesticides) were considered, giving rise to the environmental impact on land use and\nmarine eutrophication categories.\nPolymers 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 15 \n \n 3.8. Environmental Assessment \nThe main goal of the environmental assessment carried out in this study was to eval-\nuate the environmental impact of WPI film manufacture to identify the environmental \nload related to each process of turning raw materials into films. In this context, the energy \nconsumed in the manufacturing stages and th e materials used to prepare films were con-\nsidered as inputs to determine the environmen tal burden related to each process in the \nproduction of WPI films at lab-scale. As shown in Figure 8, freezing and freeze-drying \nprocesses were the main contributors (95%) to the impact load. The energy used in these processes, specifically electricity consumption,  had a critical role in the environmental im-\npact, regardless of the impact category. Th e environmental assess ment identified these \ntwo processes as the most relevant indicators. In addition to them, the use of glycerol represented around 5% of the environmental impact in both land use and marine eutroph-\nication categories. This was because glycerol is a co-product in the esterification process \nof soybean oil production to obtain biodiesel.  Ecoinvent considers an allocation factor of \n92% to soybean oil and 8% to glycerol. Thus , when glycerol was added into the film-form-\ning formulation, the impacts of soybean cultivation (e.g., use of diesel, machines, fertilis-ers, and pesticides) were considered, giving ri se to the environmental impact on land use \nand marine eutrophication categories. \n \nFigure 8. Relative contributions of each impact category for WPI film manufacture. \nThe environmental assessment of WPI films indicated that the abovementioned pro-\ncesses should be improved and optimised to reduce the environmental load associated \nwith the WPI film manufacture. As these films were developed at a laboratory scale, scal-\ning up processes could lead to achieving the goal of the reduction in the environmental \nimpacts abovementioned. As comparison of lab- scale products with in dustrial production \ndoes not provide realistic data, due to the fact that optimised processes at industrial scale, \nas well as scaling effects, lead to better resource efficiency [44], a comparative environ-\nmental assessment with a conventional food packaging was not carried out. However, the \nenvironmental assessment of an early research  state product is helpful in providing com-\nparative information related to the differen t processes involved in the product prepara-\ntion at lab-scale, which is the aim of the environmental assessment carried out in this \nwork. \nFigure 8.

Conclusions\nThe WPI used in this study contained a high presence of glutamic acid (16.6%), aspartic\nacid (11.6%), alanine (9.5%), and leucine (9.1%) amino acids. Regarding WPI-based \ufb01lms\nprepared via compression-moulding, non-covalent interactions such as H-bonds between\nWPI and AA were observed through FTIR analysis (band shifts at 1500\u20131700 cm\u00001region),\nand water absorption was also decreased from 380% down to 240%. The addition of AA\nnotably improved the UV-Vis light absorbance of WPI \ufb01lms up to 500 nm. This enhancement\nin light barrier properties would have signi\ufb01cant potential in food packaging, particularly\nin foods susceptible to UV-Vis light-induced lipid oxidation. AA addition improved the\nelongation at break due to the role as plasticiser of AA and did not compromise the gloss,\nwater vapour permeability, structure, and thermal properties of the \ufb01lms. These properties\nmake WPI a promising candidate for the replacement of fossil commodity polymers used for\nfood packaging applications. Based on the environmental assessment of WPI \ufb01lms, scaling\nup \ufb01lm manufacture could lead to the reduction in the environmental load associated with\nthe electricity consumption.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P .G. and K.d.l.C.; methodology, P .G.; formal analysis, A.E.,\nM.A. and S.C.; investigation, A.E., P .G. and K.d.l.C.; resources, K.d.l.C.; data curation, A.E., M.A. and\nS.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.E. and M.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.C., P .G. and\nK.d.l.C.; supervision, P .G. and K.d.l.C.; project administration, K.d.l.C.; funding acquisition, K.d.l.C.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: The authors would like to thank Basque Government (KK-2021/00131 and IT1658-22) for\nits \ufb01nancial support.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: The data presented in this study are available on request from the\ncorresponding author.\nAcknowledgments: A.E. thanks the State Research Agency of Spain within the Juan de la Cierva\u2014\nIncorporation action (IJC2019-039697I).\nCon\ufb02icts of Interest: The authors declare no con\ufb02ict of interest.\nReferences\n1.
