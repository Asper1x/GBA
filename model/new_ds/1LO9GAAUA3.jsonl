Nutrient\ndeficiency is an important and modifiable target in the searchfor potential risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer\ndisease (2). Deficiency of B-vitamins has been suggested as a\nkey risk factor linked to cognitive decline. Most prior studiesof B-vitamins and cognition have focused on vitamin B-12,\nfolate, and plasma homocysteine ( 3,4). Few have examined\nwhether vitamin B-6 deficiency may be related to cognitivedeclineindependentlyofotherB-vitaminsandhomocysteine( 5\u2013\n7).Most such studies have reported inconsistent findings ( 4,8),\nlargelyduetovariationsinstudydesign,outcomemeasures,andstudy populations.Therefore,there is a need for more evidence\noftheimpactofvitaminB-6oncognitivefunction,independent\nof other B-vitamins.\nCopyright C/circlecopyrtAmerican Society for Nutrition 2019.

It is also a strong antioxidant ( 9,10). Low vitamin\nB-6 intake and plasma concentration may also contribute tosystemic inflammation ( 11). Key dietary sources of vitamin\nB-6 include fortified breakfast cereal, chickpeas, meats, and\nsomefruitandvegetables,includingpotatoesandbananas( 12).\nVitamin B-6 plays a key role in the synthesis of dopamine and\nserotonin, neurotransmitters important to cognitive function\n(13). Vitamin B-6 deficiency has, thus, been implicated as\na potential modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and\nAlzheimer disease.\nPuerto Ricans living in the United States represent a\nsignificant portion of the US Hispanic population, with well-\ndocumented health disparities compared with non-Hispanicwhites as well as Mexican Americans. To our knowledge, no\nstudies to date have focused on the association between plasma\nvitamin B-6 and cognition in Puerto Ricans. Previous studieshave shown that Puerto Rican adults living in Massachusetts\nsuffer disproportionally from depression,type 2 diabetes,heart\ndisease, and cognitive impairment ( 14\u201317), compared with\nnonminority Caucasians.Thus,it is important to identify mod-\nifiable factors that might be contributing to these disparities.\nThe Boston Puerto Rican Health Study Cohort (BPRHS) hascollectedextensivedietaryandlifestyledatainadditiontoblood\nmeasuresandbaselineand2-yfollow-upcognitiveassessments,\nmaking it ideal for examining the impact of plasma pyridoxal-5\u2019-phosphate (PLP, vitamin B-6) on cognition. In this study, we\nexamined whether low plasma PLP status was associated with\nbaseline cognition and 2-y cognitive decline in the BPRHS.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThe BPRHS was approved by Institutional Review Boards at Tufts\nUniversity and the University of Massachusetts Lowell. All studyparticipants provided written informed consent.Study design,method-ology, recruitment and selection of participants, procedures of bloodcollection,measurementofvitaminB-6status,cognitiveassessment,andinformation regarding relevant covariates were described in previouspublications ( 9,18\u201321). Briefly, 1499 participants in the Boston\nPuerto Rican Study were 45\u201375 y old at baseline. Eligible participantswere enrolled if they self-identified as Puerto Rican, were able to\nanswer questions in English or Spanish, and lived in the Boston, MA\nmetropolitan area at the time of the study. Study participants wereexcluded if they had a low score ( \u226410) on the Mini Mental State Exam\n(MMSE) ( 22). This cutoff indicates severe dementia; we included this\ncutoff not for the purposes of excluding demented individuals but asan effort to limit floor effects for the other cognitive tests administeredto this cohort. Participants completed cognitive testing at baseline andat the 2-y follow-up. The participants underwent anthropometric andblood-pressure measurements at study baseline and provided a bloodsample. They completed cognitive testing at baseline and year 2 offollow-up,as detailed below.\nPlasma vitamin B-6 exposure\nPlasmavitaminB-6wasmeasuredasPLP,usingtyrosinedecarboxylase,as described by Shin-Buehring et al. ( 23). The samples were light\nprotected. The intra- and interassay CVs for the PLP assay were 5%and 6\u20138%, respectively. In our study sample, plasma PLP ranged from\n7.2 to 737 nmol/L with a mean of 57.0 nmol/L.\nAssessment of cognitive function\nStudy participants completed a cognitive testing battery administered\nby a trained research assistant in either English (2%) or Spanish (98%)(20).The MMSE was administered to assess general cognitive function\n(possible score range: 0\u201330) ( 24). Cognitive tests were administered\nfrom the neuropsychological battery of Artiola I Fortuny et al. ( 25),\nwhich was designed and validated to assess Spanish-speaking residentsofNorthAmerica:a16-wordlistlearningtasktoassessverbalmemory,with subscores including learning and immediate recall (the sum ofwords recalled over 5 learning trials; possible score range: 0\u201380),recognition(thenumberofwordsdiscriminatedcorrectlyfromalongerword list after a 25\u201335 min delay; possible score range: 0\u201316), andpercentage retention (calculated by dividing the number of wordsrecalled after the delay by the number of correct responses on the fifthlearningtrial;possiblescorerange:0\u2013100);digitspanforward(possible\nscorerange:0\u201316)andbackward(possiblescorerange:0\u201314),toassess\nattention and working memory; the Stroop test (min score 0 and noupper limit), to measure cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, andprocessingspeed;andletterfluency(minscore0andnoupperlimit),toassessthespeedatwhichonecanprovideexemplarstoacategory(three1-min trials during which participants were asked to name as manywords as they could that start with a given letter). In addition, clockdrawing (possible range: 0\u20133) ( 26) and figure copying (possible range:\n0\u201327)tasksweregiven,bothtoassessvisual-spatialorganization.Scoresforfigurecopyingwereweightedforthecomplexityofthefigurecopied:1pointforeasyfiguresand4pointsforthemostdifficult.Higherscoresoneachofthesetestssignifybettercognition.Thesamesetoftestswereadministered at baseline and at the 2-y follow-up.\nCognitive outcome variables used in statistical\nanalyses\nOur primary analyses focused on the association between tertile\ncategories of baseline plasma PLP and a global cognitive change score.Thisscore,describedinpreviouswork( 21),wascalculatedasameanof\nthezscoresforthe2-ychangesineachofthefollowingcognitivescores:\nMMSE, word list learning, recognition, percentage retention, Stroop,\nletter fluency, digit span forward and backward, clock drawing, and\nweighted figure copying. For analyses of 2-y global cognitive change,we created a binary variable representing \u201cdecline,\u201dwhich was definedbyadropinglobalcognitivescore \u22651SDfromthegroupmean( 19,27).\nWe also performed cross-sectional analyses of the association betweenbaseline plasma PLP and a baseline global cognitive score (average ofthezscores of the baseline values of the following cognitive scores:\nMMSE, word list learning, recognition, percentage retention, Stroop,letter fluency, digit span forward and backward, clock drawing, andweighted figure copying).\nWealsoexaminedassociationsbetweenbaselineplasmaPLPand2-y\nchangeineachindividualtestscore,aswellascalculatingadifferenceinchangeincognitivetestscoreper1unitdecreaseinln(PLP).Changesinindividualtestscoreswerecalculatedbysubtractingthescoreatbaselinefrom the score at 2 y for each test, thus negative values representeddeterioration and positive values represented improvement in cognitivefunction. Cross-sectional analyses of the association between baselineplasma PLP and individual cognitive tests were also conducted.\nThe BPRHS also conducted MMSE,but not other cognitive testing,\nduring the 5-y follow-up. We thus examined the association betweenbaseline plasma PLP and 5-y changes in the MMSE. Because a sizableproportion of participants (43%) did not attempt question 8 of theMMSE (counting down from 100 in 7s),for these analyses we recodedthe MMSE scores at baseline and year 5, assigning a value of 0 tocomponent 8 of the MMSE total score if it was not attempted.\nIn addition, and as described previously ( 21), we used principal\ncomponents analysis to quantify 2 major cognitive function factors:1) executive function and 2) memory, and linked plasma PLP to\nchange in these 2 factors.Based on loadings for individual baseline testscores on the 2 principal components, the individual components weredesignated as measuring the cognitive domains of executive functionand memory. Composite scores were also computed for year 2 follow-up testing data,using the means,SDs,and scoring coefficients from thebaseline principal components analysis. Difference scores for baseline\u2013follow-up were calculated for each domain, and descriptive statisticswere obtained for these difference scores. For each cognitive domain,\u201cmajor decline\u201d was defined by a drop of \u22651 SD from the group\n636 Palacios et al.\nTABLE 1 Characteristics of 949 study participants of the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study with\ncomplete baseline plasma PLP (vitamin B-6) data and complete cognitive data at baseline and 2-yfollow-up\n1\nTertile 1 ( n=315)2Tertile 2 ( n=317)2Tertile 3 ( n=317)2P-trend\nPlasmaPLP,3[mean(range)],nmol/L 20.9(7.2\u201331.3) 40.4(31.4\u201351.8) 82.0(52.0\u2013217.6)\nAge,y 56.1 \u00b17.2 56.2 \u00b17.5 56.9 \u00b17.9 0.22\nBMI,kg/m232.4\u00b17.4 32.3 \u00b16.4 30.7 \u00b15.5 0.006\nWomen 75 75 70 0.10\nPastsmoker 30 33 31 0.87\nCurrentsmoker 30 23 16 <0.001\nLessthanhighschooleducation 41 40 42 0.93\nCurrentalcoholuse 36 43 52 <0.001\nPastalcoholuse 33 28 24 0.002Diabetes 40 33 34 0.04\nHighCRP( \u22653mg/dL) 67 62 41 <0.001\nHypertension\n467 66 67 0.74\nPlasmahomocysteine, \u03bcmol/L 9.3 \u00b14.7 9.0 \u00b15.8 8.3 \u00b13.0 0.001\nSerumvitaminB-12,pg/mL 482 \u00b1240 522 \u00b1245 636 \u00b1322 <0.001\nSerumfolate,ng/mL 16.2 \u00b16.6 18.4 \u00b17.6 22.9 \u00b110.5 <0.001\nPlasmavitaminC,mg/dL 0.7 \u00b10.4 0.8 \u00b10.4 0.9 \u00b10.4 <0.001\nMultivitaminuser 24 28 39 <0.001\nPresenceof APOE541 8 2 0 2 2 0 . 3 5\nHouseholdincome(US$) 14,788 \u00b114,959 17,833 \u00b116,959 20,786 \u00b125,461 <0.001\nFamilysize(inc.self) 2.4 \u00b11.5 2.4 \u00b11.5 2.1 \u00b11.3 0.14\nMarriedandlivingwithspouse 25 35 31 0.10\nEverworked 89 90 92 0.40\nMMSE 23.7 \u00b13.0 23.7 \u00b12.9 24.2 \u00b13.1 0.03\nWordlistlearning 38.8 \u00b110.6 37.8 \u00b110.7 39.0 \u00b19.4 0.50\nRecognition 13.0 \u00b12.6 13.0 \u00b12.6 13.4 \u00b12.3 0.07\nPercentageretention 81.3 \u00b132.1 81.0 \u00b131.7 86.2 \u00b127.3 0.05\nStroop 22.6 \u00b110.1 23.9 \u00b110.4 24.9 \u00b110.4 <0.001\nLetterfluency 23.7 \u00b19.2 24.8 \u00b110.4 25.6 \u00b110.4 0.01\nDigitspanforward 7.2 \u00b11.8 7.5 \u00b12.0 7.6 \u00b11.9 0.002\nDigitspanbackward 3.4 \u00b11.4 3.5 \u00b11.5 3.7 \u00b11.6 0.01\nClockdrawing 2.2 \u00b11.0 2.2 \u00b10.9 2.1 \u00b10.9 0.78\n1Values are means \u00b1SDs or percentages unless otherwise indicated.

Trained field workers measured\nbody weight and height during the interview, and BMI (in kg/m\n2)\nwas computed. The field workers also measured blood pressure at 3time points during the study. Participants with mean systolic bloodpressure \u2265140 mm Hg or a mean diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mm\nHg, or those taking medication for hypertension, were classified ashavinghypertension.Acertifiedphlebotomistdrewfasting(12-h)bloodsamples in the home of the study participants on a day after theinterview. Participants with fasting plasma glucose >7.0 mmol/L or\nthose who reported taking medications for diabetes (insulin or oralmedicines) were classified as having type 2 diabetes ( 28). The TaqMan\nsinglenucleotidepolymorphismgenotypingassay(AppliedBiosystems)was used to assess Apolipoprotein E ( APOE) genotype, with a successrate of 95%. Serum vitamin D was measured in fasting blood samples\nobtained at baseline as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, by extraction followedby 25I radioimmunoassay with a Packard COBRA II Gamma Counter(DiaSorin Inc.). Plasma folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations weredetermined by a radioassay method using a commercially availablekit from Biorad.

Participants in the\nhigher tertiles of plasma PLP had lower BMI ( P-trend 0.006),\nlower prevalence of current smoking ( P-trend <0.001),\nhigher prevalence of current ( P-trend <0.001) and past ( P-\ntrend =0.002) alcohol use, lower prevalence of high CRP ( P-\ntrend <0.001), lower prevalence of diabetes ( P-trend 0.04),\nlower concentration of plasma homocysteine ( P-trend 0.001),\nandhigherhouseholdincome( P-trend <0.001)comparedwith\nthose in the lowest tertile.

Supplemental Table 1 presents the baseline and 2-y mean\nand SD of each of the cognitive measures administered in thisstudy. Supplemental Table 2 presents the normative cognitive\ntscores for our study participants.\nPlasma PLP was not associated with global cognition at\nbaseline after adjusting for potential confounders. In fully\nadjusted models, the mean difference in baseline global\ncognitive score, comparing the lowest to the highest tertile ofplasma PLP, was \u2212\n0.07 (95% CI: \u22120.15, 0.02), and when\ncomparing the middle to the highest tertile it was \u22120.05 (95%CI:\u22120.13, 0.03). These results are presented in Table 2. For\ncontext,the mean difference in cognition associated with 1 y of\naginginthiscohort,afteradjustmentforsexandeducation,was\u22120.018 (95% CI: \u22120.022, \u22120.013).\nLongitudinally, we found that the odds of major decline,\ndefined as being \u22651 SD below the mean 2-y decline in global\ncognition, was 2.46 (95% CI: 1.49, 4.05) when comparing\nparticipantsinthelowesttothoseinthehighesttertileofPLP( P-\ntrend across tertiles: 0.001) ( Table 4). The association between\nlow PLP and cognition was stronger among participants older\nthan 55 y (OR for comparing the lowest to the highest PLP\ntertile: 4.58; 95% CI: 2.02, 10.35; P-trend: 0.0003), and was\nnotasstrongamongthose55yandyounger( P-trend:0.21)( P-\ninteraction with age: 0.01). The association was also stronger\namong ever smokers (OR for comparing the top to the bottomtertile: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.45, 6.19; P-trend: 0.01) than among\nnever smokers ( P-trend: 0.61) ( P-interaction with smoking:\n0.02). We did not observe an interaction of the vitamin B-6\u2013cognition relation with sex ( P-interaction with sex: 0.72).\nWefoundassociation,bothatbaselineandover2y,between\nPLP concentration and performance on several individual\ncognitive tests. In fully adjusted cross-sectional analyses,\nbaselineplasmaPLPwaspositivelyassociatedwithperformanceon the Stroop test ( P-trend: 0.03) ( Supplemental Table 3 ).\nLower baseline plasma PLP was also associated with negative\n2-y changes in recognition ( P-trend: 0.05) ( Supplemental Table\n4). Several other associations were marginal, but did not\nreach statistical significance. We did not observe a significant\nassociationbetweenbaselineplasmaPLPconcentrationand5-ychange in MMSE score ( P-trend: 0.74) ( Supplemental Table 5 ).\nWe did not observe statistically significant associations\nbetween baseline PLP concentration and decline in executivefunction or memory component scores. The odds of a \u22651S D\ndecline in executive function for participants in the lowest\ncomparedwiththehighesttertileofplasmaPLPwere1.51(95%\nVitamin B-6 and cognition in Puerto Ricans 639\nCI: 0.62, 3.69), with a statistically nonsignificant P-trend of\n0.19. Similarly, in logistic regression analyses using a \u22651S D\ndeclineinthememorycomponentscoreastheoutcome,theOR\nfor participants in the lowest compared with the highest tertileofplasmaPLPwas1.32(95%CI:0.79,2.32),withastatistically\nnonsignificant P-trend of 0.26. These results are presented\ninSupplemental Table 6 . Owing to small case numbers, we\nwere only able to perform analyses adjusted for age, sex, and\neducation because addition of other covariates led to model\noverfitting, and therefore these analyses should be interpretedwith caution.\nIn sensitivity analyses, adding CRP to our full regression\nmodels did not significantly affect the results (OR for\n2-y decline: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.48, 4.01; P-trend: 0.01), and\nthere was no effect modification by CRP ( P-interaction: 0.40).\nAdditional adjustment for depressive symptomology using the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)\nscore,householdincome,maritalstatus(marriedandlivingwithspouse compared with not), employment status (ever worked\ncompared with not), or psychological acculturation scale did\nnotsubstantiallyaltertheresults.Ourcross-sectionalsensitivityanalysis, including all participants ( n=1274) at baseline with\navailable cognitive scores, regardless of the availability of\n2-y cognitive scores, was not substantially different from ourprimary analyses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study of Puerto Rican adults living in the greaterBostonarea,wefoundevidencefavoringanassociationbetweenlower plasma PLP concentration and cognitive decline over\n2 y, which is in general agreement with prior studies. The\nVeterans Affairs Normative Ageing Study of men reported asignificant association between low (PLP <46 nmol/L) vitamin\nB-6 and cognitive decline over 3 y ( 4). A recent study in an\nIrishpopulationof155participants,aged60\u201388y,alsoreportedsignificant associations between plasma vitamin B-6 status and\ncognitive decline ( 8). In the MacArthur Study of Successful\nAging,vitaminB-6wasassociated,cross-sectionally,withbettercognitiveperformance,althoughprospectiveresultsfocusingon\ncognitive decline did not show significance ( 33).\nOur study has several strengths, including the careful\nassessment of exposures and outcomes. Vitamin B-6 was\nmeasured as plasma PLP, which is a more objective measure\nof vitamin B-6 status than an estimate of dietary intakefrom questionnaires.Cognitive function was measured with an\nextensive neuropsychological battery of Artiola I Fortuny et\nal.\u2019s (25),administered by trained study personnel in the native\nlanguage of the study participants.Another important strength\nis the prospective nature of the study, which allowed us to\nexamine change in cognitive function over 2 y as the primary\noutcome of interest.We were able to adjust for a wide range of\npotential confounders,including serum concentrations of otherB-vitamins and homocysteine. We considered the possibility\nthat the effect of vitamin B-6 on cognition may be through its\nimpact on systemic inflammation. There was limited evidenceof mediation by CRP, and adding CRP and white blood cell\ncount to our models did not substantially alter the results.\nHowever, the interrelation between vitamin B-6, inflammation,and cognition is complex ( 11,34) and there is some evidence\nthat inflammation lowers plasma PLP concentrations ( 35),\nwhich must also be considered.The focus on a US mainland Puerto Rican population\nis also a unique strength of this study, because it provides\ninformation on a modifiable dietary risk factor in a distinct\nand vulnerable population. However, because of the focus onPuerto Rican adults, our study is not entirely generalizable\nto other populations. Although we adjusted for a wide range\nof potential confounders, there may be other unmeasuredvariables that could mediate the association between plasma\nPLP concentration and cognitive decline. Also, the study did\nnot include clinical assessments of the participants, so we didnot have clinical designations of \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cMild Cognitive\nImpairment (MCI),\u201d or \u201cdementia.\u201d Finally, because of the\nobservational nature of this study, causal associations between\nplasma vitamin B-6 and cognitive function and decline cannot\nbe established. There remains a possibility that the observedresults are due to reverse causation,or residual confounding by\nother nutrients, deprivation, or socioeconomic status. Longer\nfollow-up, in this and other cohorts, with better adjustmentfor factors associated with deprivation and socioeconomic\nstatus, will be needed to address this issue. There also remains\na possibility of selection bias if participants with low PLPconcentrationanddecliningcognitionselectivelydroppedoutof\nthe study between the baseline and year-2 visits.We conducted\ncross-sectional sensitivity analyses among all participants whohad available PLP and cognitive data at baseline ( n=1274),\nregardless of whether they had participated in the 2-y follow-\nup.Theresultsoftheseanalyseswerenotsubstantiallydifferentfrom our main results. Finally, there is a possibility of a\nlearning effect over 2 y due to participants learning tasks after\ncompleting the baseline assessment.\nInourstudypopulation,12%ofthepopulationwasdeficient\nin vitamin B-6 (PLP <20 nmol/L) and an additional 17% was\ninsufficient (20 \u2264PLP\u226430 nmol/L). Given the findings of this\nstudy, more work is needed in both Puerto Rican and other\npopulations to further understand the nature and extent of\nthe association between vitamin B-6 and cognitive decline. Ifthis association is confirmed, efforts should be taken to reduce\nvitamin B-6 deficiency.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Esther Carver and Oladimeji (Jimmy) Akinlawon\nfor assistance with this manuscript.The authors\u2019 contributions\nwereasfollows\u2014NP,KLT,TS,andXG:designedandconductedtheresearch;NPandNS:analyzedthedata;NP:wrotethepaper\nandhadprimaryresponsibilityforfinalcontent;andallauthors:\nread and approved the final manuscript.\nReferences\n1.
