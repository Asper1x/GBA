The MYB transcrip \u2011\ntion factors have garnered recognition for their pivotal role in orchestrating a multitude of plant biological pathways. \nNevertheless, the enumeration and characterization of the MYBs within Z. officinale Roscoe remains unknown. This \nstudy embarks on a genome \u2011wide scrutiny of the MYB gene lineage in ginger, with the aim of cataloging all ZoMYB  \ngenes implicated in the biosynthesis of gingerols and curcuminoids, and elucidating their potential regulatory \nmechanisms in counteracting abiotic stress, thereby influencing ginger growth and development.\nResults In this study, we identified an MYB gene family comprising 231 members in ginger genome. This ensemble \ncomprises 74 singular \u2011repeat MYBs (1R\u2011MYB), 156 double \u2011repeat MYBs (R2R3\u2011MYB), and a solitary triple \u2011repeat MYB \n(R1R2R3\u2011MYB). Moreover, a comprehensive analysis encompassing the sequence features, conserved protein motifs, \nphylogenetic relationships, chromosome location, and gene duplication events of the ZoMYBs  was conducted. We \nclassified ZoMYBs into 37 groups, congruent with the number of conserved domains and gene structure analysis. \nAdditionally, the expression profiles of ZoMYBs  during development and under various stresses, including ABA, cold, \ndrought, heat, and salt, were investigated in ginger utilizing both RNA\u2011seq data and qRT \u2011PCR analysis.\nConclusion This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the MYB family in ginger and lays the foundation \nfor the future investigation of the potential functions of ZoMYB  genes in ginger growth, development and abiotic \nstress tolerance of ginger.\nKeywords  Ginger, ZoMYB, Rhizome development, Abiotic stress, Expression patterns\nBackground\nThe plant Zingiber officinale Roscoe, commonly known \nas ginger, belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and plays \na significant role in the pharmaceutical and food indus -\ntries. The therapeutic attributes of ginger are well-docu -\nmented, encompassing anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, \nand neuroprotective properties [1\u20133]. The rhizome of \nginger, a revered culinary spice and a staple in dietary \nsupplements, boasts a rich composition of essential \namino acids, minerals, vitamins, dietary fibers, and fla -\nvonoids [4]. The development of the ginger rhizome is a \ndelicately regulated biological process, underpinned by a \nsuite of genes pivotal to its morphogenesis and matura -\ntion [5]. Moreover, with the release of the ginger genome *Correspondence:\nHai\u2011Tao Xing\nxinght@cqwu.edu.cn\nHong\u2011Lei Li\nlihonglei215@cqwu.edu.cn\n1 College of Landscape Architecture and Life Science/Institute of Special \nPlants, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences, Chongqing 402168, \nChina\n2 Biological Sciences Research Center, Academy for Advanced \nInterdisciplinary Studies, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China\n3 Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, \nChina\n4 Chongqing Key Laboratory for Germplasm Innovation of Special \nAromatic Spice Plants, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences, \nChongqing 402168, China\nPage 2 of 18 Xing\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \nsequence [6], has spurred explorations into transcrip -\ntion factor (TF) families, such as AP2/ERF and GRAS, \nposited to influence rhizome ontogeny [5, 7]. Despite \nthese advances, such factors constitute but a fraction of \nthe elaborate transcriptional network governing rhizome \ndevelopment in ginger.\nMYB transcription factors, one of the most expansive \nand functionally versatile TF families in eukaryotes, are \ncharacterized by a conserved MYB DNA-binding domain \n(DBD) at the N-terminus, typically composed of one to \nfour imperfect repeats (R). These R units, each span -\nning 51-52 amino acids, form a helix-turn-helix (HTH) \nstructural motif [8\u201310]. MYB proteins are stratified \ninto four subfamilies based on the number of R repeats: \nMYB-related (1R-MYB, featuring a single or partial R \nrepeat), R2R3-MYB, R1R2R3-MYB (encompassing three \nR repeats), and the less understood 4R-MYB proteins. \nThe C-terminal region of MYB proteins is notably diver -\ngent, reflecting the family\u2019s broad regulatory spectrum \n[11\u201313]. The R2R3-MYB subfamily, distinguished by two \ncontiguous R domains, is recognized as the most popu -\nlous and functionally significant within the MYB constel -\nlation. Evolutionary theories suggest that the R2R3-MYB \nlineage may have evolved following the loss of the R1 \nrepeat or, as posited by Jiang et\u00a0 al. (2004), through an \nintragenic duplication event that appended the R1 repeat \nto pre-existing R2R3 MYB genes [14, 15]. Conversely, \nthe 4R-MYB subfamily, the smallest contingent, remains \nenigmatic in its functional roles [13].\nMYB TFs exhibit a widespread distribution in higher \nplants. Prolific research has illuminated their regula -\ntory involvement in primary and secondary metabo -\nlism, as well as cell morphogenesis [16, 17]. Misra \net\u00a0al., (2010) illustrated that the ectopic overexpression \nof AtMYB12 in tobacco resulted in enhanced resist -\nance to insect pests Spodoptera litura and Helicov -\nerpa armigera, attributed to elevated rutin levels [18]. \nSimilarly, AtMYB11, AtMYB12, and AtMYB111 have \nbeen shown to individually augment genes within the \nphenylpropanoid pathway, such as those encoding \nflavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), chalcone isomerase \n(CHI), chalcone synthase (CHS) and flavonol synthase \n(FLS) proteins, thereby amplifying flavonol biosynthe -\nsis [18\u2013 21]. In Epimedium sagittatum, the R2R3-MYB \nregulator MYBF1 was found to activate the EsF3H (fla -\nvanone 3-hydroxylase) and EsFLS  (flavonol synthase) \npromoters, with its overexpression in tobacco lead -\ning to an increase in flavonol and a decrease in antho -\ncyanin levels in flowers [22]. In Malus domestica, the \nMYB factors MdMYBA , MdMYB1, and MdMYB3 have \nbeen identified as key determinants in the biosyn -\nthesis of red-pigmented anthocyanins in apple peel \n[23\u201325]. Moreover, MYB TFs have been implicated in the secondary metabolism of lignin. In Arabidopsis, \nSND1 , associated with the cell wall formation, directly \ntargets MYB83 and MYB46, inducing their expression, \nwhich in turn activates MYB58, MYB63, and MYB85. \nThese MYBs interact with AC elements in the promot -\ners of lignin biosynthesis genes, driving their expres -\nsion [26\u2013 28]. Chen et\u00a0al., (2017) highlighted the role of \nRep-MYBs, a repressor-type R1R2R3-MYB, in inhibit -\ning G2/M-specific genes in response to DNA damage in \nArabidopsis [29].\nThere is growing evidence indicating that MYB TF \nalso has a crucial function in plant responses to abi -\notic stress [30]. In Arabidopsis, AtMYB2 is induced \nby dehydration, salt stress, and exogenous ABA, with \nits overexpression in transgenic plants leading to the \nup regulation of drought-responsive genes RD22 and \nADH1, suggesting a role in ABA-mediated drought \nstress responses [31]. Wyrzykowska et\u00a0al., (2022) iden -\ntified MYB33, MYB65, and MYB101 as key players in \nthe Arabidopsis drought response via the ABA sign -\naling pathway [32]. AtMYB2 is also implicated in salt \nstress tolerance, as evidenced by the enhanced resist -\nance of AtMYB2-OE (Overexpression of AtMYB2) lines \nto salinity [33]. Furthermore, increased AtMYB44 levels \nhave been associated with improved salt stress resist -\nance [34]. The induction of\u00a0 AtMYB41 and AtMYB96 by \ndrought, ABA, and salt stress in Arabidopsis [35, 36], \nthe overexpression of OsMYB3R-2 in rice enhancing \nresistance to freezing, drought, and salinity [37], and \nthe response of AtMYB68 to high temperatures [38] \ncollectively underscore the multifaceted role of MYB \nTFs in stress adaptation. OsMYB55 has been observed \nto bolster amino acid metabolism, contributing to high-\ntemperature tolerance in rice [39].\nGinger, with its substantial economic importance as a \nmedicinal and culinary crop, is often challenged by abi -\notic stresses such as extreme temperatures, salinity, and \ndrought, which hinder rhizome cultivation and reduce \nyields [40, 41]. The identification of MYB as a master \nregulator of multiple pathways in plants has been estab -\nlished. However, despite its identification in numerous \nplant species, comprehensive cataloging of MYB in Z. \nofficinale Roscoe has not been conducted. The success -\nful sequencing of the ginger genome has enabled the \ngenomic analysis of ginger MYB genes [6]. This study \naims to delineate the MYB gene family in ginger by iden -\ntifying the signature MYB repeats, cataloguing candidate \ngenes, and probing their coding proteins in ginger data -\nbases. Additionally, we have embarked on an analysis of \nthe evolutionary and expression dynamics of the MYB \nfamily in ginger, with the anticipation that our findings \nwill enrich our understanding of MYB genes\u2019 roles in this \neconomically significant plant.\nPage 3 of 18\n Xing\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \n \nMaterials and\u00a0methods\nGene identification and\u00a0classification\nIn light of the genomic data from our ginger genome \nproject, previous methodologies have elucidated the \npresence of a copious MYB gene repertoire within the \nZingiber  genome [6]. Candidate genes were selected \nusing BLASTP , with a score value of \u2265100 and e-value of \n\u2264 e-10. The MYB domain HMM profile (PF00249) was \nobtained from the Pfam protein family database (http:// \npfam. xfam. org/). HMMER 3.1 was used to perform a \nHMM search against the Z. officinale genome database. \nA\u00a0 manual\u00a0 assessment\u00a0 was\u00a0 conducted\u00a0 using the Pfam \ndatabase\u00a0( http:// pfam. janel ia. org/)\u00a0to verify all the\u00a0puta -\ntive candidate MYB genes.\nArabidopsis MYB protein sequences were obtained \nfrom the TAIR database (https:// www. arabi dopsis. \norg/). The derived MYB proteins from ginger and those \nof Arabidopsis were aligned using MAFFT version 7 \nwith default parameters [42], followed by manual exci -\nsion of non-homologous regions within the alignment.. \nA maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis was \nconducted using FastTree with the JTT+G substitution \nmodel, incorporating 1000 non-parametric bootstrap \n(BS) replicates. Gaps within the data were treated as \nmissing information [43, 44].\nSequence analysis\nPhysicochemical properties of each MYB gene, including \nopen reading frame (ORF) length, protein length, exon-\nintron distribution, isoelectric point (pI), and molecular \nweight (MW) for were analyzed using online ExPASy \n(http:// www. expasy. ch/ tools/ pi_ tool. html). In addition, \nwe determined the conserved motifs of the MYB proteins \nfrom ginger, using the MEME (http:// meme-  suite. org/) \nprogram.\nChromosomal distribution and\u00a0duplication of\u00a0ZoMYB \ngenes\nThe physical distribution map of ZoMYB  genes on chro -\nmosomes was generated according to position informa -\ntion provided by the ginger genome [6]. Gene duplication \nevents of ZoMYBs  were analysed by MCScanX. The \nMYB syntenic relationship between ginger and Arabi -\ndopsis thaliana, Solanum tuberosum, Musa acuminata, \nand Oryza sativa were determined by Dual Systeny Plot -\nter software of TBtools [45]. Non-synonymous (Ka) and \nsynonymous (Ks) substitution rates were calculated using \nthe KaKs_Calculator (http:// code. google. com/p/ kaks- \ncalcu lator/ wiki/ KaKs_ Calcu lator) [46].\nPromoter cis\u2011regulatory element analysis\nThe 2000 bp upstream regions of the start codon of \nZoMYB  genes were obtained from the Z. officinale Roscoe genome. cis-acting regulatory elements within the ZoMYB \ngenes were identified using the online tool PlantCARE \n(http:// bioin forma  tics. psb. ugent. be/ webto  ols/ plant  care/  \nhtml/). The outcomes were visualized using the Simple \nbiosequence view feature of TBtools [45].\nPlant materials\nThe ginger cultivar \u2018LAIWU No.2\u2019 were used in this \nstudy. Seedlings approximately six months of age, includ -\ning leaves (third position from the apical to basal stem), \nroots, leaf buds, rhizome buds, flower buds, mature flow -\ners, basal stems, flower petioles,  1st,  2nd, and  3rd rhizome \ninter-nodes,were collected for the expression analyses of \nZoMYB  genes. In order to examine the role of ZoMYB \ngenes in response to various abiotic stress responses, \ntwo-month-old seedlings underwent drought and salt \nstress treatments. The seedlings were exposed to a 15% \nPEG6000 solution and a 200 mM NaCl solution, respec -\ntively, for watering purposes. A 0.1 mM ABA solution \nwas sprayed onto ginger leaves. Heat and cold stress \ntreatments were administered at 40\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C, respec -\ntively. Leaf samples were harvested at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, \nand 48 hours post cold, drought, and salt treatments, \nrespectively. Each response was replicated thrice. For \nheat treatment, leaf samples were collected at 0, 1, 3, 6, \n12, and 24 hours. Collected samples were immediately \nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nSubcellular location analyses\nThe subcellular localization of ZoMYBs were predicted \nusing the WoLF PSORT online web server (https:// wolfp \nsort. hgc. jp/). To confirm the location of ZoMYB#188 and \nZoMYB#149, their fulllength coding sequence (CDS) \nwithout stop codon were cloned into pCAMBIA1300 and \nfused at the C-terminal of the green fluorescent protein \n(GFP) using the primer pairs CDS-BamH I -Faw/noTAA-\nBamH I-Rev, respectively. The resulting ZoMYB-GFP \nfusion expression vectors were sequenced and introduced \ninto Agrobacterium GV3101 using the freeze\u2013thaw \nmethod. The vector GV3101 (A. tumefaciens) carrying \n35S::GFP-ZoMYB and a control vector (35S::GFP) were \nthen infiltrated into tobacco epidermal leaves. Green \nfluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence driven by the 35S \npromoter was observed 36\u201348\u00a0 h post-infiltration using \na confocal microscope (Olympus FV1200). Plant nuclei \nwere visualized by staining with 4, 6-diamidino-2- phe -\nnylindole (DAPI).\nExpression analysis of\u00a0ZoMYB genes by\u00a0RNA\u2011seq \nand\u00a0qRT\u2011PCR\nRNA-seq was performed on samples acquired 12\u00a0 h post \nABA, heat, cold, salt, and drought treatments.The transcrip -\ntome data were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive \nPage 4 of 18 Xing\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \n(Project Accession Number: SRP064226). Expression levels \nin RNA-Seq were analyzed using FPKM values. TBtools \nwas used to transform the FPKM values to  log2 (FPKM + 1) \nvalues and generate an expression heatmap for the ZoMYB  \ngenes [45]. Total RNA was extracted from collected samples \nusing the Plant RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, \ncDNA was synthesized utilizing the PrimeScript RT reagent \nKit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Dalian, China). Quantitative \nreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) \nwas conducted on a TP800 Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time \nSystem (Takara) using SYBR Premix ExTaq (Takara, Kyoto, \nJapan). The total reaction volume was 10 \u03bcL, comprising 5 \n\u03bcL of SYBR mix, 0.4 \u03bcL of primer mix (10\u00a0\u03bcM), 0.5 \u03bcL cDNA \ntemplate, and 4.1 \u03bcL  ddH2O. The qRT-PCR amplification \nconditions were as follows: 95\u25e6 C for 1\u00a0min, followed by 40 \ncycles at 95\u25e6 C for 10\u00a0s and 60\u25e6 C for 30\u00a0s. A melting curve \nranging from 60 to 95\u25e6 C was generated to verify primer \nspecificity. The ZoTUB2 gene as the internal reference. \nThree biological replicate experiments were conducted. Rel -\native expression levels of ZoMYBs  were determined using \nthe  2\u2212\u0394\u0394 CT method [47]. qRTPCR primers were designed \nusing DNAman software (Supplementary Table\u00a09 ).\nResults\nComprehensive identification of\u00a0ZoMYB gene family \nin\u00a0ginger\nA total of 231 ZoMYBs  were identified in Z. officinale after \nremoving redundant repetitive sequences. These genes, \nnow designated ZoMYB#1 through ZoMYB#231, were \nchromosomally mapped and systematically renamed in \naccordance with their chromosomal positioning. The \nZoMYB family is categorized into three distinct subfami -\nlies: 156 R2R3-MYB proteins (2R-MYB sub family), 1 \nR1R2R3-MYB protein (3R MYB subfamily), and 74 MYB-\nrelated proteins (MYB related subfamily). Notably absent \nwere representatives of the 4R-MYB class. Detailed attrib -\nutes including coding sequence, protein sequence, sub-\ncellular localization, isoelectric point (PI), and molecular \nweights (MWs) are meticulously compiled in Supplemen -\ntary Tables S1 . ZoMYB#49 ( Maker00069396) encodes the \nlargest protein sequence with 1649 amino acid (aa), while \nZoMYB#97 ( Maker00078016) encodes the most com -\npact protein at 73 aa, reflective of its singular MYB DBD \ndomain. The molecular weights of the proteins span from \n8243.9\u00a0 Da (ZoMYB#97) to 182,772.28\u00a0 Da (ZoMYB#49), \nwith isoelectric points ranging from 4.38 (ZoMYB#97) to \n9.96 (ZoMYB#215), respectively.\nPhylogenetic insights into\u00a0MYB genes in\u00a0ginger \nand\u00a0Arabidopsis\nA phylogenetic reconstruction was undertaken using \nthe amino acid sequences of the full complement of 231 ZoMYB and 197 AtMYB proteins to elucidate evolu -\ntionary relationships. Based on the phylogenetic tree, \n231ZoMYB  genes in ginger were divided into 37 groups \n(Z1-Z37) (Fig.\u00a0 1, Supplemetary Document S1). Rely -\ning on the group classification of R2R3-MYB in Arabi -\ndopsis, the R2R3-MYBs were mainly belong to groups, \ndesignated Z2, Z3, Z6, Z7, Z8, Z9, Z10, Z11, Z12, Z13, \nZ14, Z15, Z17, Z18, Z20, Z21, Z22, Z23, Z24, Z25, Z27, \nZ28, Z32, Z33, and Z34. The MYB-related genes were \nmainly belong to Z1, Z26, Z29, Z30, Z31, Z35, Z36, and \nZ37. Notably, clades Z7, Z9, Z13, Z14, Z18, Z19, Z21, \nZ22, Z23, Z25, Z31, and Z32 have both MYB-related and \nR2R3-MYB genes. For example, clade Z6 included two \nMYB related type proteins, ZoMYB#56 and ZoMYB#77, \ntogether with other 7 R2R3 MYB proteins (ZoMYB#134, \n#152, #167, #181, #205, #231, and #214). Clade Z27, with \n21 members, emerged as the most populous, while clades \nZ5 and Z16 were the least diverse, each containing a sin -\ngle membe.\nDivergence in\u00a0gene structure and\u00a0motif composition \nwithin\u00a0ZoMYBs\nAn intricate examination of the exon\u2013intron architecture \nof ZoMYB transcription factors (TFs) in ginger was under -\ntaken to elucidate the sequence diversity inherent to this \ngene family. The sequence structure of 1R-MYB, R1R2R3-\nMYB and R2R3-MYB in ginger were demonstrated sepa -\nrately. Illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 2a, the 74 genes of the 1R-MYB \ncategory alongside a singular R1R2R3-MYB gene exhibited \na range of exon counts, extending from a minimum of two \nto a maximum of 19. The intricacies of this exon\u2013intron \nstructural variance among the 74 1R-MYB genes, as well \nas the sole R1R2R3-MYB gene, are depicted in Fig.\u00a0 2a. \nThe exon tally for the 1R-MYB genes varied from one to \n16, with the lone R1R2R3-MYB gene (ZoMYB#197) com -\nprising a total of 19 exons. A notable proportion of the \n1R-MYB genes predominantly possessed two (25.68%, \n19/74) or three exons (29.73%, 22/74), while configura -\ntions of 10, 11, 15, and 16 exons were unique occurrences. \nAs delineated in Fig.\u00a0 4a, the ensemble of 156 R2R3-MYB \ngenes was characterized by a disparity in exon numbers, \nwhich spanned from one to 11. A majority of the R2R3-\nMYBs in ginger conformed to the canonical splicing \npattern of three exons (60.26%, 94 of 156 R2R3-MYB) \ninterspersed by two introns (20.51%, 32/156). The CDS of \nmost ZoMYB  genes were interrupted by introns, with the \nexception of six ZoMYBs  genes (ZoMYB#47, ZoMYB#122, \nZoMYB#151, ZoMYB#163, ZoMYB#171, ZoMYB#201) \nwhich remained uninterrupted. In addition, when viewed \nin conjunction with the phylogenetic tree classification, \nmembers of the ZoMYB  gene family that clustered within \nthe same phylogenetic clade generally shared similar or \nPage 5 of 18\n Xing\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \n \nidentical exon counts, notwithstanding variations in exon \npositioning. For instance, the ZoMYB  gene groups Z19 \nand Z20 both contained three exons, whereas the Z8 clade \nexhibited a range of two to six exons (Supplementary Table \nS1). In sum, the exon numbers of ZoMYB  genes from gin -\nger are quite divergent, however, the closer phylogeneti -\ncal relationship is indicative of a greater homogeneity in \nsequence structure.\nTo illuminate the conserved domains within ZoMYB \nproteins, motif analysis via MEME suite was performed, identifying twenty motifs across the 1R-MYB, R1R2R3-\nMYB and R2R3-MYB proteins of ginger (Figs.\u00a0 3b, \nand\u00a0 4b). As shown in Fig.\u00a0 3b and Supplementary Fig -\nure S2, motif 2 and motif 6 were ubiquitous across the \n1R-MYB proteins, whereas motif 1, 2, 3, and 7 were inte -\ngral in encoding the MYB DNA-binding domain (DBD) \nwithin the R2R3-MYB proteins. In 1R-MYB types, differ -\nent groups had different motifs, and motif 2 was common \nin all 1R-MYB proteins in Fig.\u00a0 3b. The members from \ngroups Z1 group were characterized by the presence of Fig. 1 Phylogenetic analysis of MYB proteins from ginger and Arabidopsis.

Group Z31 was distinguished by motifs \n5, 2, 6, and 1, and group Z8 by motifs 2, 6, and 3. This \nmotif distribution underscores the lower sequence simi -\nlarity among 1R-MYB proteins across different phy -\nlogenetic clades. Within the subset of 156 R2R3-MYB \nproteins, 85 were found to contain motifs 4, 3, 7, 1, and 2. \nZoMYB#131 was exclusively composed of motifs 3 and 7. \nA unique motif signature, comprising motifs 6, 3, and 5, \nwas identified in the R2R3-MYB proteins associated with \nthe Z33 and Z32 clades. The 3R-MYB (ZoMYB#197) has \nthree conserved motifs 2, 5 and 6, with motifs 2 repeated \nfour times, and motifs 6 and 5 each being duplicated \nwithin this protein structure. Moreover, specific motif \npatterns unique to ZoMYB were discerned. For instance, \nZoMYB#31 and ZoMYB#84 were solely characterized by \nmotifs 2 and 5, respectively.\nAnalysis of\u00a0cis\u2011acting elements of\u00a0ZoMYB promoters\nA total of 57 cis-acting elements were identified in the \npromoter region (upstream 2000 base pair) of ZoMYBs , \nwhich could be classified into five categories: phytohor -\nmones (ABA responsiveness elements, Auxin respon -\nsiveness elements, Gibberellin responsiveness elements, \nMeJA responsiveness elements, SA responsiveness elements), \nenvironmental stress (Drought-inducibility elements, Defense and stress responsiveness elements, Low-temperature \nresponsiveness elements, Anaerobic induction elements), \nphoto-responsive elements (Light responsiveness ele -\nments, phytochrome down-regulation expression ele -\nments), growth and developmental elements (Cell cycle \nregulation elements, Circadian control elements, Root \nspecific elements, Seed-specific regulation elements, \nEndosperm expression elements, Meristem expression \nelements) and secondary metabolic elements (MYB bind -\ning site involved in flavonoid biosynthetic genes regula -\ntion, Zein metabolism regulation), as delineated in Fig.\u00a0 4, \nSupplementary Table S2, and Supplementary Table S3. \nThe majority of ZoMYB  genes exhibite the presence \nof a minimum of one phytohormone-responsive ele -\nment within their promoter regions. A total of twelve \nphytohormone-responsive cis-acting elements were dis -\ncerned, including ABRE, AuxRR-core, TGA-element, \nTGA-box, P-box, GARE-motif, TATC-box, TGACG-\nmotif, CGTCA-motif, TCA-element, SARE, and O2-site. \nThe cis-acting elements play a crucial role in regulating \nthe responsiveness to ABA, auxin, gibberellin, methyl \njasmonate, salicylic acid, and zein metabolism. Mean -\nwhile, the ABRE responsiveness elements were the \nmost common in the ZoMYB  gene promoters. Further -\nmore, 34 cis-acting elements play a role in light respon -\nsiveness. Eight cis-regulatory elements associated with \nFig. 4 Regulatory elements in the promoter of ZoMYBs . a Regulatory elements in 1R and 3R\u2011MYB genes promoter. b Regulatory elements in R2\u2011R3 \nMYB genes promoter, with Different colors denoting different cis\u2011acting elements\nPage 9 of 18\n Xing\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \n \nresponse to abiotic stresses were identified, including the \nlow-temperature responsive element (LTR), anaerobic \ninduction elements (ARE), drought-inducibility element \n(MBS), defense and stress responsive element (TC-rich \nrepeats), and circadian control element (circadian).The \nLight responsiveness elements (2873), MeJA-respon -\nsiveness elements (934), ABA responsiveness elements \n(574), Anaerobic induction elements (351), Gibberellin \nresponsiveness elements (228), Drought-inducibility ele -\nments (185) was observed in the majority of the 1R-and \n2R-ZoMYB  genes. The 3R-ZoMYB  gene (ZoMYB#197) \nis notably enriched with light-responsive elements (15 in \ntotal) and possesses a modest array of stress-responsive \nelements, including two MeJA-responsiveness elements, \ntwo ABA responsiveness elements, and two anaerobic \ninduction elements. The MSA-like element, associated \nwith cell cycle, was uniquely present in 10 ZoMYB  genes \n(ZoMYB#220, ZoMYB#44, ZoMYB#154, ZoMYB#89, \nZoMYB#18, ZoMYB#102, ZoMYB#68, ZoMYB#27, \nZoMYB#26, ZoMYB#74). A quartet of meristem expres -\nsion elements were identified in each of ZoMYB#186, \nZoMYB#133, and ZoMYB#25. Furthermore, a singular MYB \nbinding site, integral to the regulation of flavonoid bio -\nsynthetic gene elements, was found within ZoMYB#205, \nZoMYB#124, ZoMYB#207, ZoMYB#147, ZoMYB#88, \nZoMYB#117, ZoMYB#65, ZoMYB#132, ZoMYB#48, \nZoMYB#24.\nChromosomal distribution, gene duplication, and\u00a0synteny \nanalyses of\u00a0ZoMYB genes\nChromosomal allocation studies revealed a heterogene -\nous dispersal of ZoMYB  genes across the 11 chromosomes \nof ginger (Supplementary Figure S4 ). Chromosomes \n10, 6, and 8 harbored the highest contingents of ZoMYB  \n(29, 27, and 27 genes, respectively), whereas chromo -\nsome 2 presented with a minimal assemblage of 9 ZoMYB  \ngenes. Proliferation of the ZoMYB  gene family has pre -\ndominantly been propelled by gene duplication events. \nIt\u00a0was\u00a0found\u00a0that\u00a034 ZoMYB  genes are clustered into 15 \ntandem duplication regions among ginger\u00a0chromosomes 4, \n5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11(Supplementary Figure S 4 and Sup -\nplementary Table S4 ). Three tandem-duplicate\u00a0gene pairs \nwere found on\u00a0chromosome 6, ( ZoMYB#87-ZoMYB#88, \nZoMYB#93-ZoMYB#94, ZoMYB#89-ZoMYB#90) and \nchromosome 10 (ZoMYB#188-ZoMYB#189, ZoMYB#184-\nZoMYB#185, ZoMYB#193-ZoMYB#194); Addition -\nally, two tandem-duplicate gene pairs were detected on \nchromosome 5 (ZoMYB#66-ZoMYB#67, ZoMYB#75-\nZoMYB#76), chromosome 8 (ZoMYB#147-ZoMYB#148, \nZoMYB#138-ZoMYB#139-ZoMYB#140), chromosome 9 \n(ZoMYB#165-ZoMYB#166, ZoMYB#170-ZoMYB#171) and \nchromosome 11 (ZoMYB#225-ZoMYB#26, ZoMYB#210-\nZoMYB#211), with a sole tandem-duplicate gene pair on chromosome 4 (ZoMYB#42-ZoMYB#43). Among these \ntandem duplicated gene pairs, eight exhibited identical \n(ZoMYB#66-ZoMYB#67, ZoMYB#75-ZoMYB#76) or homolo -\ngous (ZoMYB#89-ZoMYB#90, ZoMYB#42-ZoMYB#43, \nZoMYB#138-ZoMYB#139-ZoMYB#140, ZoMYB#147-\nZoMYB#148, ZoMYB#87-ZoMYB#88, ZoMYB#184-\nZoMYB#185) motifs. And the remaining seven pairs \ncontained different motifs (ZoMYB#93-ZoMYB#94, \nZoMYB#165-ZoMYB#166, ZoMYB#170-ZoMYB#171, \nZoMYB#188-ZoMYB#189, ZoMYB#193-ZoMYB#194, \nZoMYB#225-ZoMYB#226, ZoMYB#210-ZoMYB#211). \nBeyond tandem duplications, 82 pairs of segmentally duplica -\ntions were found within the ginger genome (Supplementary \nTable S4 ). The synteny analysis highlighted a conservation of \nMYB transcription factors across ginger chromosomes, with \nnumerous homologous genes situated on disparate chromo -\nsomal tracts (Fig.\u00a05 ).\nEvolutionary analysis of\u00a0ZoMYB genes\nIn\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0gain\u00a0a\u00a0deeper\u00a0understanding\u00a0of the phylogeny \nof the MYB\u00a0family,\u00a0we conducted a comprehensive syn -\nteny analysis comparing the ginger genome with those \nof four divergent plant species, including two monocots \n(M.acuminata and O.sativa), and two dicots (A. thaliana \nand S. tuberosum). The analysis revealed that a total of \n75 ZoMYB  genes exhibit syntenic relationships with 91 \ncorresponding genes in M.acuminata, This was followed \nby 14 syntenic relationships with O.sativa, and a single \nsyntenic relationship with an A. thaliana gene (Fig.\u00a0 6 \nand Supplementary Table\u00a0 S5). There were 91, 15, and 1 \npairs of orthologous genes identified between ginger and \nM. acuminata, O. sativa, and A. thaliana, respectively. \nZoMYB#153 (Maker00037045) was found to be syntenic \nwith three gene pairs in M.acuminata, while ZoMYB#216 \n(Maker00052236) corresponded with four M. acuminata \ngene pairs. The ZoMYB  genes demonstrated a significant \ndegree of orthology with the reference genomes, with\u00a0 M.\nacuminata\u00a0 demonstrated a significant degree of orthol -\nogy with the reference genomes, following by O.sativa \nwhich displayed 15 orthologous gene pairs scattered \nacross chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and A. thaliana, \nwith a single orthologous gene pair on chromosome \n2. However, no syntenic relationships were identified \nbetween ginger and S. tuberosum\u00a0(Fig.\u00a0 6 and Supplemen -\ntary Table\u00a0S5). Further examination of the syntenic rela -\ntionships between ginger and M. acuminata MYB genes \nrevealed that 10 ZoMYBs  were linked to two syntenic \ngene pairs each, 2 ZoMYBs  were identified to be associ -\nated with 3 syntenic gene pairs each, and 1 ZoMYB  gene \nwas linked to 4 syntenic gene pairs.\nTo enrich our comprehension of the evolution -\nary pressures imposed upon the MYB gene lineage, \nan analysis of the nonsynonymous to synonymous \nPage 10 of 18 Xing\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \nsubstitution rate ratio (Ka/Ks) for MYB gene pairs was \nundertaken. As delineated in Supplementary Table S6 , \nit was observed that the Ka/Ks ratios for all tandemly \nand segmentally duplicated ZoMYB  gene pairs, as well \nas the majority of orthologous MYB  gene pairs, were \ndiscerned to be less than one, indicative of purifying \nselection acting upon these sequences.Expression profiling of\u00a0ginger ZoMYB genes in\u00a0different \ntissues\nTo explore the potential function of the ZoMYB  genes at \ndifferent stages of ginger development, RNA-sequencing \ndata were utilized to ascertain their expression profiles \n(Fig.\u00a0 7a and Supplementary Table S7).

BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \n \nanalyses were carried out on 12 representative sam -\nples for 12 selected ZoMYB  genes (Fig.\u00a0 7b). Among the \n231 ZoMYB family genes, three ZoMYBs  (ZoMYB#92, \nZoMYB#94, ZoMYB#100) were not detected in any \ntested samples, suggesting the possibility of highly \nspecialized spatio-temporal expression patterns that our \ndataset did not capture, or alternatively, these may \nrepresent pseudogenes. Among the 12 samples tested, \nthe expression of 100 ZoMYB  genes were detected \n(FPKM  > 0), and 26 ZoMYB genes were constitutively \nexpressed (FPKM > 1 in all samples). Eight ZoMYB  genes \n(ZoMYB#98, ZoMYB#53, ZoMYB#208, ZoMYB#213, \nZoMYB#145, ZoMYB#167, ZoMYB#101, and ZoMYB#95) \nare preferentially expressed in roots, one gene in flower bud (ZoMYB#12), four in young flower (ZoMYB#41, \nZoMYB#11, ZoMYB#152, ZoMYB#215), two in mature \nflower (ZoMYB#149 and ZoMYB#73), three in shoot api -\ncal bud (ZoMYB#74, ZoMYB#72 and ZoMYB#66), one \nin leaves (ZoMYB#227) shown relative higher expression \nlevel than other ZoMYBs . The expression pattern of some \nZoMYBs  exhibited divergent tendency during different \nstage of development. For example, the expression levels \nof ZoMYB#143/182/155/202 were gradually increased, \nwhereas that of ZoMYB#34/230/61/161/ 22/23/158/162 \nwere gradually decreased during the rhizome development \nstages (Fig.\u00a0 7a). Eight ZoMYBs  were randomly selected to \nvalidate RNA-seq result by qRT-PCR. The results showed \nthat the results are consistent with the RNA-seq (Fig.\u00a0 7b).\nFig. 6 Synteny analysis of MYB  genes between ginger and other four representative plant species.

BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \nExpression profiles of\u00a0ZoMYB genes under\u00a0abiotic stress \nconditions\nTo elucidate the potential roles of ZoMYB  genes under \nvarious abiotic stresses, we analyzed RNA-seq data to \ndetermine their transcriptional responses to heat, cold, \nsalt, drought, and ABA treatments. A total of 154 ZoMYB  \ngenes were induced or reduced in response to at least one \nstress treatment compared with time 0 (CK) (Fig.\u00a0 8a). \nConcisely, exposure to cold stress prompted the upregu -\nlation of 39 ZoMYBs , drought stress influenced 37, heat \nstress affected another 37, ABA treatment modulated \n48, and saline conditions altered the expression of 62 \ngenes (Supplementary Table S8). A subset of 8, 1, 4, and \n9 ZoMYBs  exhibited unique enhancements in response \nto ABA, cold, heat, and salt stress, respectively. Notably, \ndrought stress did not uniquely induce any ZoMYB  gene. \nA total of 13 ZoMYBs  exhibited an upregulated expres -\nsion pattern across all five abiotic stress treatments. \n(Supplementary Figure S5). Ten of these 13 ZoMYBs  \nare R2R3-MYB types, while the remaining three are \nMYB-related types. These include three genes from the \nZ34 group, three from Z18 group, and two from Z25 group. ZoMYB#51 was enhanced in drought, heat and \nABA stress treatment. Conversely, 49, 32, 40, 25, and 24 \nZoMYB  members were down-regulated by cold, drought, \nheat, ABA, and salt treatments, respectively. Ten ZoMYBs  \nwere reduced in all the five abiotic stress treatment, with \nfour belonging to the Z34 group (R2R3-MYB type) and \nthe Z10 group (MYB-related type). Distinct decreases \nwere observed in 3, 10, 4, 1, and 1 ZoMYBs  in response \nto ABA, cold, heat, drought, and salt stress, respec -\ntively. (Supplementary Figure S6). Nine ZoMYBs  were \nreduced in both drought and heat stress. Among these \ndifferentially expressed genes, ZoMYB#3, ZoMYB#177, \nZoMYB#221, belong to Z34 group were induced, while \nfour genes, namely ZoMYB#60, ZoMYB#5, ZoMYB#105, \nand ZoMYB#202 also belong to Z34. Furthermore, we \nevaluated the expression patterns of 41 randomly selected \nZoMYB  genes under heat, low temperature, drought, salt \nand ABA stress conditions using qRT-PCR. Each of the \n41 chosen ZoMYB  genes manifested significant upregula -\ntion at one or several time points during stress exposure \n(as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 8b), corroborating the expression \ntrends observed in the RNA-seq analysis.\nFig. 7 ZoMYB  gene expression profile analysis in ginger. a Hierarchical cluster analysis of ZoMYB  gene expression profiles in 12 different tissues \nand developmental stages of ginger as determined by RNA\u2011seq.

BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \n \nSubcellular localization of ZoMYB proteins\nThe subcellular localization of ginger MYB proteins \nfrom ginger was initially predicted using WoLF PSORT \n(Supplementary Table S1). Among the ZoMYB pro -\nteins, a substantial majority of 90.48% (209/231) were \npredicted to to localize to the nucleus. Additionally, \n5.19% (12/231) were predicted to be chloroplastic, 1.30% \n(3/231) mitochondrial, another 1.30% (3/231) peroxi -\nsomal, 0.865% (2/231) cytoplasmic, and the remaining \n0.865% (2/231) cytoskeletal. To verify these predictions, \ntwo genes, ZoMYB#149 and ZoMYB#188, which exhib -\nited pronounced responsiveness to elevated tempera -\ntures and were specifically expressed in certain tissues, \nwere selected for empirical validation through a transient \nexpression assay. The fusion proteins ZoMYB#149-GFP \nand ZoMYB#188-GFP were observed to accumulated in \nthe nuclei of epidermal cells. This was in stark contrast \nto the control GFP alone (vector control, 35::GFP), which \nwas distributed throughout both the cytoplasm and \nthe nucleus of the epidermal cells (Fig.\u00a0 9). The empiri -\ncal findings were congruent with the predicted subcel -\nlular localizations, reinforcing the accuracy of the initial \npredictions.\nDiscussion\nThe MYB transcription factor (TF) family constitutes one \nof the most expansive TF contingents within the plant \nkingdom. Comprehensive characterizations of the MYB \ngene clan have been executed across a diverse array of \nplant species, such as A. thaliana [48], Z. mays [49], O. \nsativa [48], and S. tuberosum [16], wherein these MYB genes have been implicated in an array of physiological \nprocesses, encompassing both primary and secondary \nmetabolism, cell cycle regulation, and the response to \nabiotic and biotic stressors [50\u201353]. Z. officinale Roscoe, \na medical and vegetable plants, commands a pivotal role \nin the pharmaceutical and food industries. Despite the \nunveiling of the ginger genome in 2021 [6], the explora -\ntion of MYB proteins within ginger has remained nas -\ncent. Given the pivotal role of MYB proteins within the \nbotanical realm, this study represents the inaugural com -\nprehensive investigation of the MYB gene family predi -\ncated on the sequenced genome of Z. officinale Roscoe.\nIn this study, a screening of the ginger genome yielded \na total of 231 members, including 156 R2R3-MYBs, 74 \n1R-MYB proteins, and one R1R2R3-MYB member. How -\never, none of the 4R-MYB members were identified in \nginger genome (Supplementary Table S1). The R2R3-\nMYB subfamily is preeminent within ginger, suggesting \nthat the expansion of this gene family might elucidate \nthe profusion of ZoMYB memebers. Gene duplication \nevents are an important mechanism that results in the \nevolutionary expansion of gene families. Within the con -\ntext of ginger, the analysis of gene duplication revealed \n15 gene pairs resulting from tandem duplication and 82 \npairs resulting segmental duplication. Similarly, in Casu -\narina equisetifolia and Pyrus bretschneideri, duplication \nevents have precipitated the expansion of the MYB gene \nfamily within their genomes, indicating that tandem and \nsegmental duplication have collectively facilitated the \nexpansion of the MYB gene family across diverse plant \nspecies throughout evolutionary history [54, 55]. The Ka/\nFig. 8 Expression profiles of ZoMYB  genes under various abiotic stress treatments. a ZoMYB  genes expression in response to various abiotic \nstress as determined by RNA\u2011seq.

BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \nKs ratios observed amongst the MYB gene pairs indicate \nthat the MYB gene family in ginger may have undergone \nstrong purifying selective pressure during its evolution -\nary history (Supplementary Table S6).\nThe physical parameters of MYBs across different \nplants exhibit considerable. The MWs of the ZoMYB \nproteins ranged from 8.24 (ZoMYB#97) to 182.77\u00a0 kDa \n(ZoMYB#49), with predicted pI values range from 4.38 \n(ZoMYB#97) to 9.96 (ZoMYB#215). The MW of rice \nMYB proteins ranged from 7.61 to 170.492\u00a0 kDa, with \npI values from to 3.99 to 12.26, whereas the MW of \nArabidopsis MYB (AtMYB) proteins ranged from 7.57 \nto 158.27\u00a0kDa, with pI values from to 4.16 to 10.24 [56]. \nThese findings suggest a conserved evolutionary trajec -\ntory for the MYB gene family.\nTo study the intron distribution in the Z. officinale \nRoscoe genome, we investigated the exon-intron struc -\nture of ZoMYB  genes. Within a given clade, the number \nof introns and exons was either identical or exhibited \nsimilarity. As shown in Figs\u00a0 2a and 3a, a substantial \n93.40%(225/231) of ZoMYB  genes were disrupted by \nintrons, with the majority harboring between one to \neighteen introns. Among the ZoMYB  genes analyzed, it \nwas found that 22.51% (52/231) and 50.22% (116/231) \npossessed two or three exons, respectively. This feature of MYB gene structures was similar to the numbers of \nintrons in Arabidopsis and rice [56].\nGene duplication not only augments gene families but \nalso fosters functional diversification. In the context of gin -\nger, the analysis of gene duplication revealed 15 gene pairs \nstemming from tandem duplications and 82 pairs from \nsegmental duplications. This suggests that ZoMYB has \nundergone gene expansion due to genomic duplications \n(Figure\u00a0 5). The Ka/Ks ratios observed amongst the MYB \ngene pairs indicate that the MYB gene family in ginger may \nhave been subject to intense purifying selective pressures.\nNotably, ZoMYB#3/4/5 were found to be associated \nwith 26, 14, and 13 segmental duplication gene pairs, \nrespectively, indicating their potential conservation \nand antiquity. The expression of numerous duplicated \nZoMYBs across different tissues suggests that these \ngenes may have redundant or specific cellular func -\ntions during the growth and development of ginger. The \nexpression patterns of ZoMYB#89 and ZoMYB#90 pro -\nvide evidence for potential differences between dupli -\ncated gene pairs. ZoMYB#90 exhibited high expression \nlevels in the rhizome bud, young flower bud, and root, \nwhereas ZoMYB#89 was not expressed in any organs \nor tissues. Notably, ZoMYB#89 expression was sig -\nnificantly enhanced under ABA, cold, drought, heat, \nFig. 9 Subcellular localization of seven GFP \u2011fused ZoMYB proteins.

Scale bars = 50 \u03bcm\nPage 15 of 18\n Xing\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \n \nand salt treatments. Despite exposure to stress signals, \nZoMYB#90 exhibits minimal changes in response. In \nZoMYB#90, the motifs Motif-3, Motif-1, and Motif-2 \nremain identical in composition and position, as depicted \nin Fig.\u00a0 3. Consequently, we infer that the duplication of \nthe ZoMYB  gene has led to the emergence of novel func -\ntions and expression patterns. Furthermore, functional \ndivergence may result in differential expression profiles \nof gene pairs. For instance, ZoMAYB#3 exhibited high \nexpression levels in the rhizome bud, while ZoMYB#167 \npeaked in roots, as indicated in Supplementary Table \nS7. ZoMYB#3 gene (motif-4, motif-3, motif-7, motif-1, \nmotif-2, motif-8) exhibited the presence of motif 4 and \nmotif 8, whereas ZoMYB#167 (motif 3, motif 7, motif 1, \nmotif 2) lacked these motifs (Fig.\u00a0 3), suggesting that motif \ncomposition changes due to segmental duplication may \ncontribute to functional divergence. Preliminary pre -\ndictions of gene function can be made through analysis \nof gene expression patterns [57]. The results of the tis -\nsue expression patterns analysis revealed that a total of \n36.49% (27/74) of 1R-MYB genes, 52.56% (82/156) of \nR2R3-MYB genes, and one 3R-MYB gene were expressed \nin all the tested tissues, as depicted in Fig.\u00a0 7 and Supple -\nmentary Table S7. Notably, 16 ZoMYBs  exhibited higher \nexpression levels in roots compared to other tissues, \nwhich is consistent with findings in other plant species \n[58]. Furthermore, the flowering mechanism in ginger \nremains unclear. Our study reveals that ZoMYB  genes, \nspecifically 13, 21, and 24, are highly expressed in floral \nbuds, young flowers, and mature flowers, respectively. \nNotably, ZoMYB#22/63 are abundant in floral buds, \nwhile ZoMYB#41/11/60/106 were more prevalent in \nyoung flowers, and ZoMYB#73/84/149/122 were more \nabundant in mature flowers. It is noteworthy that genes \nthat are high homologous in the same clade of a phyloge -\nnetic tree tend to have high sequence similarity and may \nperform similar functions [59, 60].\nBased on phylogenetic analysis, ZoMYB#92 exhib -\nited significant homology with AtMYB80. In Arabidop -\nsis, cotton, and Brassica, MYB80 homologs have been \nrevealed to play roles in the regulation of tapetal and pol -\nlen development, thereby providing a potential avenue \nfor elucidating the function of ZoMYB#92 [61]. In ginger, \nZoMYB#92 was exclusively expressed in mature flowers, \nsuggesting it may play a role in regulating flower devel -\nopment. Further investigation is warranted to determine \nwhether ZoMYB#92 is also involved in the control of \ntapetal and pollen development in ginger. The flowering \ntime in Arabidopsis is negatively affected by by MYR1 \nand MYR2 under reduced light intensity, as reported in \n[62]. In the case of ginger, the promoter of ZoMYB#170, \nwhich is the homolog of MYR1  and MYR2 , contains nine \ncis-elements that are responsive to light. This suggests that ZoMYB#170 may be involved in regulating the flow -\nering time of ginger in response to light signals.\nGiven that rhizome expansion is a crucial factor affect -\ning ginger production and thus has garnered signifi -\ncant attention in cultivation. Zhuang et\u00a0 al. (2022) have \nreported that in Arabidopsis, MYB42 and MYB85 are \njointly responsible for the negative regulation of hypoco -\ntyl cell elongation [63]. Through phylogenetic analysis, it \nhas been established that ZoMYB#94/125 are orthologs \nof MYB42/85. ZoMYB#94/125 were also highly expressed \nin the internodes of the rhizome, which is likely associ -\nated with rhizome elongation. Gingerols and curcumi -\nnoids are considered the most significant medicinal \ncompounds in ginger. The rhizome of ginger contains a \ngreater abundance of gingerols and curcuminoids com -\npared to other organs. Li et\u00a0al. (2021) reported that the \nexpression patterns of seven MYB genes were similar to \nthose of the enzyme genes involved in the biosynthesis \nof gingerols and curcuminoids [6]. Our study revealed \nthat ZoMYB#34/55/96/158/64/113 exhibited a gradual \nreduction from the young node (1st internode) to the old \nnode (3rd internode) during rhizome development, while \nZoMYB#2/59/182/202 a gradual increased (Fig.\u00a0 7). These \nfindings suggest that these ZoMYBs may play roles in regu -\nlating the biosynthesis of gingerols and curcuminoids com -\npounds. According to cis-element analysis, it was found that \nfive R2R3-MYB genes (ZoMYB#205/147/88/132/48) and \nfive MYB-related genes (ZoMYB#24/124/207/117/65) \npromoters contained flavonoid biosynthetic regulation \nelement, indicating their regulatory function in flavonoid \nbiosynthesis (Fig.\u00a04).\nThe regulatory role of MYB TFs in plant responses \nto environmental stress has been extensively investi -\ngated [ 30, 51, 52]. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 4 and Supplementary \nTable\u00a0S2, most of the ZoMYB  gene promoters contained \nhormone-related regulatory elements and abiotic stress-\nrelated regulatory elements, such as low temperature \nresponsiveness, drought-inducibility, defense and stress \nresponsiveness. These findings suggest ZoMYB  genes \nmay directly or indirectly modulate the response of ginger \nto abiotic stress. In general, environmental responsive -\nness elements, as as lower temperature, drought, and so \non, were the most common in ZoMYB  gene promoters. \nHowever, none of ZoMYB  genes contained salt respon -\nsiveness element (Fig.\u00a0 8 and Supplementary Table\u00a0 8). \nThese result suggest that the transcriptional regulation \nof different ZoMYB  genes is diverse, indicating the multi-\nfunctionality of MYBs in ginger. In the present investiga -\ntion, the expression patterns of selected ZoMYB  genes \nexhibited significant fluctuations under various stress \ntreatments, including ABA, cold, heat, drought, and salt. \nThese findings suggest that these ZoMYBs  may play key \nroles in ginger\u2019s resistance to these stresses. Increasing \nPage 16 of 18 Xing\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:460 \nevidence suggests that specific MYB  genes are involved in \nthe response to multiple stresses. For instance, MYB49-\noverexpressing tomato plants exhibited significant resist -\nance to Phytophthora infestans, as well as tolerance to \nsalt and drought stresses [64]. Similarly, in Arabidop -\nsis, MYB41 expression was not detected under normal \ngrowth conditions, but was found to be upregulated in \nresponse to high levels of drought, ABA, and salt stress \n[65]. Overexpression of MYB41 in transgenic plants \nresulted in improved salinity tolerance during germina -\ntion and root growth. In ginger, ZoMYB#53/118 were \nalso classified into this group.\nZoMYB#53 and ZoMYB#118 exhibited significant \ninduction in response to salt, ABA, cold, and drought \nstress. Furthermore, ZoMYB#118 also displayed induction \nin response to heat stress, while ZoMYB#53 did not exhibit \nany response. The expression patterns of ZoMYB#53 \nand ZoMYB#118 differed in response to salt stress, with \nZoMYB#118 exhibiting a rapid response at 1 h, peaking at \n12 h, and gradually decreasing within 24-48 h. In contrast, \nZoMYB#53 exhibited no response until 3 h after salt stress, \nand gradually increasing from 6 to 48 h, peaking at 48 h \n(Fig.\u00a0 8b). Our analysis revealed that in ginger, the expres -\nsion of ZoMYB#11/36/105/204 gradually increased in \nresponse to salt from 1 to 48 hours, while ZoMYB#60/202 \ngradually decreased. AtMYB44 is activated under diverse \nabiotic stresses, including low temperature, dehydra -\ntion, salinity, and ABA. Overexpression of AtMYB44 lines \nresulted in a reduced rate of water loss and significantly \nimproved tolerance to salt and drought stress compared \nto WT plants [34]. ZoMYB#122/163/201 exhibited close \nhomology with AtMYB44. In ginger, the expression of \nZoMYB#163 was significantly upregulated in response to \ncold and salt stress, while exhibiting negligible response to \nABA, drought, and heat stress. Conversely, ZoMYB#122 \nwas markedly induced by all five stressors (ABA, cold, \ndrought, heat, and salt), with cold stress instigating an \namplification in expression exceeding 500-fold. On the \nother hand, ZoMYB#201 displayed minimal variation \nin expression levels in response to these abiotic stresses. \nOverexpression of AtMYB75 in transgenic lines led to a \nnotable increase in flavonoid accumulation, which exhib -\nited potent antioxidant activity and improved tolerance \nto abiotic stresses such as oxidative and drought stresses \n[66, 67]. In ginger, ZoMYB#84, ZoMYB#193, ZoMYB#31, \nand ZoMYB#97 were grouped together with AtMYB75. \nZoMYB#84 exhibited a significant increase in expression \nlevels in response to all five stressors except for salt stress, \nwhereas ZoMYB#31, ZoMYB#97, and ZoMYB#193 were \nonly significantly induced by heat and salt stress. These \npatterns of gene expression intimate that the ZoMYBs  may \nhave a crucial function in responding to various stressors.Conclusions\nThis study conducted a methodical examination of the \nMYB family genes within Z. officinale Roscoe, culminat -\ning in the identification of 231 distinct MYB genes. These \ngenes were unevenly distributed across 11 chromosomes. \nPhylogenetic analysis revealed the clustering of ZoMYBs \ninto 37 subgroups, each characterized by congruent gene \nstructures and motif compositions. Additionally, the syn -\nteny analysis demonstrated that ZoMYB  genes had the \nhighest number of orthologous gene pairs with MYB \ngenes in Musa acuminata, followed by Oryza sativa. \nThe findings of this study suggest that ZoMYB  genes are \nintegral to the developmental processes of ginger. Specifi -\ncally, the gradual decrease in ZoMYB#34/230/61/161/22\n/23/158/162 during rhizome developmental stages indi -\ncates their potential relevance in this biological process. \nMoreover, the analysis of RNA-Seq datasets revealed that \n41 ZoMYB genes exhibited responses to abiotic stress. \nNotably, 39 ZoMYBs  were induced by cold, 37 by drought \nand heat, 48 by ABA, and 62 by salt. In summary, these \nfindings pave the way for further exploration of the func -\ntional roles of individual MYB  genes in ginger.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1186/ s12864\u2011 024\u2011 10392\u20111.\nSupplementary Material 1.\nSupplementary Material 2.\nSupplementary Material 3.\nSupplementary Material 4.\nSupplementary Material 5.\nSupplementary Material 6.\nSupplementary Material 7.\nSupplementary Material 8.\nSupplementary Material 9.\nSupplementary Material 10.\nSupplementary Material 11.\nSupplementary Material 12.\nSupplementary Material 13.\nSupplementary Material 14.\nSupplementary Material 15.\nSupplementary Material 16.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nConceptualization, H\u2011 T.X., and H\u2013L.L; Methodology, H\u2011 T.X; Software, H\u2011 T.X. \nS\u2011Q.Y; Validation, H\u2011 T.X., J\u2011 Y.S., S\u2011 Q.Y., J\u2011L.L., and Q \u2011H.W; Formal Analysis, H\u2011 T.X.; \nInvestigation,H\u2011 T.X., and H\u2013L.L; Resources, H\u2011 T.X., and H\u2013L.L.; Data Cura\u2011\ntion, H\u2011 T.X.; Writing \u2013 Original Draft Preparation, H\u2011 T.X; Writing \u2013 Review & \nEditing, H\u2011 T.X.; Visualization, H\u2013L.L; Supervision, H\u2011 T.X., and H\u2013L.L; Project \nAdministration,H\u2011 T.X; Funding Acquisition,H\u2011 T.X.
