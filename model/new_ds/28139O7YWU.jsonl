Willis4, Charles Wood5, Chipepo Kankasa1and Concetta C. DiRusso3*\nAbstract\nBackground: Nut butter-based Ready to Use Supplemental Foods (RUSF) are an effective way to add nutrients and\ncalories to diets of malnourished and food insecure populations. The RUSF formulations have been further modified\nto add micronutrients including iron and folic acid needed during pregnancy and lactation. Because\ndocosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) enhances fetal development and birth outcomes, it has been suggested\nthat perhaps RUSF formulations for pregnancy should also include this Omega 3 fatty acid. The goal of the present\nstudy was to gain an understanding of Zambian women \u2019s knowledge of nutritional needs in pregnancy through\nstructured focus group discussions, and to formulate and determine the acceptability of a RUSF with DHA.\nMethods: Structured focus group sessions were conducted among women attending an antenatal clinic at the\nUniversity Teaching Hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia. Dietary and nutrition knowledge was surveyed through structured\ndialogue that was recorded by audio and transcribed verbatim. An RUSF containing 400 mg DHA from fish oil in 50\ng RUSF was designed and assessed for fatty acid content and product stability. Participants then sampled the RUSF-\nDHA, provided feedback on taste, and were surveyed about willingness to consume the novel formula using a\nstandardized hedonic instrument.\nResults: The participants \u2019knowledge of foods recommended for use in pregnancy included fruits, vegetables, meat,\nand fish. Most women reported eating fish at least once per week, although the specific type of fish varied. Most\ndid not have prior knowledge of the importance of consuming fish during pregnancy or that some fish types were\nmore nutritional than others as they included omega 3 fatty acids. The participants were uniformly accepting of the\nRUSF-DHA for the purpose of enhancing birth and developmental outcomes, but were critical of the aroma in\nhedonic testing.\nConclusions: Women were committed to consuming a healthy diet that would impact the outcome of pregnancy,\nand were receptive to advice on the importance of consuming foods such as fish as a source of DHA. The RUSF-\nDHA formulation was acceptable due to the potential benefits for the developing infant, however, the fishy odor\nmay be limiting for long-term daily use.\nKeywords: Ready to use supplemental foods (RUSF), Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Omega 3, Focus groups,\nHedonic assessment, Malnutrition, Food insecurity, Zambia, Pregnancy\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:93 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-2783-8\nBackground\nMaternal, infant, and child nutrition is accepted as a key\ndeterminant of health that is vital to human capital\ndevelopment and, as such, is a high priority for Sub-\nSaharan Africa [ 1,2]. Zambia has a population of ap-\nproximately 16 million and about half of these are\nwomen of reproductive age (15 \u201349) [ 1]. More than a\nthird of women give birth to their first child before age\n18 and 50% by the age of 20. Additionally, 10% of\nwomen aged 15 \u201349 are underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2),\n) and 14.3% of women in Zambia are living with HIV.\nLow pre-pregnancy BMI, short stature and HIV are\namong the risk factors for poor birth outcomes. In the\nunder-five age group, 14.8% are underweight and 40%\nare stunted, with 17% severely stunted. It is estimated\nthat only 11% of children aged 6 \u201323 months are fed ad-\nequately based upon recommended feeding practices [ 1].\nAbout 72,000 children (0 \u201314 years) are infected with\nHIV. Due to the high rates of both malnutrition and\nHIV infection in Zambia, it is essential that nutrition be\noptimized to maximize development, growth, and the\nability to resist and fight infectious disease [ 2,3].\nImproving maternal and infant nutrition and health is\na major focus of the Zambian Government to ensure the\npopulation reaches its full potential [ 1,4]. However, the\ndietary diversity for women and children in Zambia is\nhighly dependent upon socioeconomic status, such that\na low diversity index correlates with malnutrition and\nfood insufficiency [ 5,6]. Animal-source foods are limited\nand the diet is highly dependent on starchy staples such\nas the corn-based porridge, nshima . Therefore, the basic\ndiet of the very low income population has limited diver-\nsity, contributing to insufficient daily protein and micro-\nnutrient intake, and minimal consumption of long chain\npolyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids [ 1]. Fish is an important\nstaple in the Zambian diet and fish intake correlates with\ndietary diversity and lower levels of stunting [ 2,5,7].\nThe small sardine-like fish species, kapenta , are a rich\nsource of DHA and native to Zambia [ 7]. However, in\nrecent years, fish has become expensive and availability\nmore limited, especially in urban Zambia where the bulk\nof the population resides.\nIn cases of undernutrition, intervention and recovery\nprograms can help to improve nutritional status. These\noften include Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF)\nthat are formulated to treat moderate (MAM) and severe\nacute malnutrition (SAM) [ 8,9]. The base of one class\ncalled lipid nutritional supplements (LNS) is nut paste,\ngenerally peanut butter, that is supplemented to meet\ndaily macro- and micro-nutrient requirements including\nthe essential fatty acids [ 8,10,11]. When first developed,\nthe sole purpose of these lipid based RUTFs was short-\nterm use in SAM to raise the individual \u2019s body weight\nover 3 \u20134 weeks after which the patient could betransitioned to a conventional diet [ 10]. In actuality, due\nto pervasive malnutrition and food insecurity, the thera-\npeutic foods are used over months to supplement the\ndiet of children with MAM and SAM under the age of\nfive and pregnant or lactating women [ 11,12]. This has\nled to the development of Ready to Use Supplemental\nFoods (RUSF) that provide the daily requirement for es-\nsential micronutrients, and a lesser amount of the mac-\nronutrients, to bring added value to the daily food intake\nand enhance, but not replace, a conventional diet.\nOne point of concern with the lipid-based RUTFs is\nthat the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids in these\nfood supplements are from plant oils and include only\nlinoleic acid (LA n-6) and linolenic acid (LN n-3). These\ntwo fatty acids must be further processed in the body to\nmake the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids arachi-\ndonic acid (AA n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA n-3)\nand docosahexaenoic acid (DHA n-3). This biological\nprocess is inefficient in humans [ 13]. Because DHA is a\nbuilding block for fetal brain growth, large amounts are\nrequired during fetal development and for 24 months\nafter birth [ 14]. When a pregnant woman is food inse-\ncure, her fetus, and later her infant, are at risk for sub-\noptimal brain development and function. If both food\ninsecure and living with HIV, fetal brain development\nand function are further at risk [ 2,15,16]. Therefore,\nthere is much interest in developing dietary supplements\nthat include DHA, during pregnancy and lactation, to\nsupport neuronal development [ 17,18].\nGiven the high rate of malnutrition and stunting in\nZambia and the value of RUSF for use in addressing\nsome of the nutritional problems of women and their in-\nfants, we developed an RUSF with fish oil to supply the\nDHA crucial to fetal and infant brain growth. The goals\nof the present study were to assess the knowledge of\npregnant women about what foods are required during\npregnancy for maximizing fetal development and, more\nspecifically, to address knowledge about the need for es-\nsential fatty acids including DHA in the diet for brain\ndevelopment. Employing focus group discussions sur-\nrounding nutrition and health, as well as hedonic testing\nof the RUSF-DHA, the current study presents findings\non nutrition knowledge for pregnancy and the accept-\nability the peanut butter-based RUSF with fish oil to\npregnant women in Zambia.\nMethods\nStudy site\nThis work was a collaboration between the University\nTeaching Hospitals (UTHs), Lusaka, Zambia and the\nUniversity of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.A. Ex-\nperimental design, ethical conduct of the research, and\nthe data sharing plan were approved by Institutional Re-\nview Boards at each institution to comply with ZambianChunda-Liyoka et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:93 Page 2 of 14\nand US laws (UNZAREC IRB #00005948 and UNL IRB\n#20170416833FB). Experimental design met NIH pol-\nicies regarding conflict of interest, biosafety, human par-\nticipant research, data collection and analysis, and\nconfidentiality.\nThis study took place in Lusaka, Zambia, at the UTHs,\nwhich are part of a complex of hospitals that include the\nWomen and Newborn Hospital, Children \u2019s Hospital,\nAdult and Emergency Hospital, Eye Hospital and Cancer\nDiseases Hospital. Lusaka is the largest city in Zambia\nwith a population of about 2.4 million inclusive of the\nmetropolitan area, which is 15% of the total national\npopulation. The UTHs comprise the largest health care\ncenter in the country. The Women and New Born Hos-\npital of the UTHs facilitate approximately 60 \u201380 ante-\nnatal clinic screenings performed per day and 900 \u20131000\ndeliveries per month, on average, providing a large pa-\ntient population pool for the studies reported here.\nParticipants\nAll participants were recruited from the antenatal clinic\nof the Women and Newborn Hospital in Lusaka. The in-\ndividuals were selected for participation in the focus\ngroup at random from a pool of approximately 150\nwomen being recruited for a larger preclinical trial. The\nparticipant pool was made up of women of reproductive\nage who were pregnant and of a typical pre-pregnancy\nbody mass, i.e., between 18 and 25 kg/m2and neither\nover- or under-weight. Referral for participation was\nmade through collaborating medical doctors in the UTH\nWomen and Newborn Hospital antenatal care clinic\n(ANC). Information about the study was verbally given\nto potential participants by study nurses and/or doctors.\nThose that understood and accepted the invitation were\nasked to provide written informed consent to be in-\ncluded in the study.\nFocus group site and procedures\nThe sessions were held in the ANC meeting and training\nroom. The room was an open space with rows of\nbenches used for antenatal lessons and clinic appoint-\nment registration holding about 60 \u201380 persons at cap-\nacity. The focus groups were held at times when the\nroom was not scheduled for other purposes. However,\nthe outside entrance was at the back of the room, conse-\nquently, some individuals who were not participating\ncould enter or exit during focus group sessions. The\nnumber of non-participants never exceeded 5 \u201310 and\nthese individuals stayed at the back of the room away\nfrom the discussions. Non-participants were instructed\nto remain silent during session conversations.\nThree focus group sessions with 7 \u201310 participants (to-\ntaling 27) were held on 3 different days between Septem-\nber and November 2017. This number was consideredadequate to engage participants in a conversation with-\nout inhibiting more reticent individuals [ 19]. A core\nteam of professionals ran the sessions and included two\nphysicians (authors MKL and MI), one study nurse and\none nutritionist. All had experience in conducting ses-\nsions of this type for the purpose of teaching and re-\nsearch. Only the nutritionist was male, and although\nsession leadership roles varied, the same professionals\nparticipated in all 3 sessions using the same script. The\npredominant language used during focus groups was\nNyanja with some English, which was understood by\nmost participants. In one of the groups, there was a cli-\nent who could not understand Nyanja /English, so\nBemba had to be used as well. An audio recording was\nmade of each session after informing the clients that dis-\ncussions would be recorded. The 3 session recordings\nwere translated to English by a professional translator\nand verified by one investigator (MKL). Additionally, a\nvideo recording was made of one session for archival\npurposes.\nFocus group discussion guides\nThe transcript of the focus group discussion is available in\nAdditional file 1and is outlined in Table 1.B r i e f l y ,t h ei n t r o -\nduction welcomed the participants and instructed them on\nt h ep u r p o s eo ft h em e e t i n g ,t h e manner in which discussions\nwere to be conducted, and explained that the sessions would\nbe recorded by audio taping. Then the discussion proceeded\naround questions about food consumption patterns and nu-\ntritional intake during pregnan cy, as well as the intake of fish.\nSubsequently, the RUSF-DHA was offered for hedonic as-\nsessment and discussion of probable acceptance and use as a\ndietary supplement in pregnancy.\nAnalysis of Focus Group Responses.\nThe transcripts from the 3 focus group sessions were\nassessed independently by 3 of the study investigators\nusing content analysis methods [ 20]. The coding units\nwere established a priori for the quantitative data and the\nscript of the sessions was based on the various categories\ndeveloped into questions as listed in Table 1. Coding cen-\ntered on 4 themes: knowledge of nutritional needs in\npregnancy; knowledge of fish intake for omega 3 DHA\nconsumption; familiarity with RUSF; acceptability and pal-\natability of new RUSF-DHA. After the 3 analysts rated the\nresponses independently, a summative response database\nwas generated and then employed to yield Table 2.\nTo assess the acceptability of the RUSF-DHA, each\nparticipant was offered a 50 g sachet to taste the product\nand asked to verbally express their response for aroma,\ntexture, flavor, aftertaste, and overall attributes. Each\nparticipant also recorded their response on a 9-point he-\ndonic testing instrument. The data were assessed using\nleast squares means.Chunda-Liyoka et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:93 Page 3 of 14\nFormulation and analysis of the RUSF-DHA\nThe Ready to Use Supplemental Food with DHA\n(RUSF-DHA) formulation was based on World Health\nOrganization guidance [ 8]. The base was peanut butter\nand supplements were formulated as in iLiNS [ 21]. A\ndosage of 400 mg DHA in 50 g RUSF was selected, based\non previous studies that recommended this level of\nDHA to maximize birth outcomes [ 22]. To supply thislevel of DHA, the RUSF was supplemented with 5.22%\nMeg-3 \u2122\u201830\u2019n-3 Food Oil, a highly refined tuna oil that\nhas a minimum of 9% EPA and 12.5% DHA (DSM Nu-\ntritional Products, Inc.). The formulation was prepared\nin the factory of Edesia Nutrition, Inc. (Kindstown, RI)\nand transported to Zambia by express shipping.\nEach batch of RUSF-DHA was evaluated for fatty acid\ncontent after Folch extraction, acid hydrolysis and con-\nversion to methyl esters using gas chromatography and\nmass spectrometry as is standard in the DiRusso labora-\ntory [ 23]. A commercial thiobarbituric acid reactive sub-\nstances (TBARS) analysis kit was used to measure lipid\nperoxidation (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) of the\nRUSF-DHA product.\nResults\nFocus group assessment regarding dietary practices and\nknowledge of nutrition\nParticipants were enrolled during antenatal clinic visits\nfor sessions being held that day. In total, 3 sessions were\nconvened. Twenty seven women, 7 in the first session,\nand 10 in sessions two and three, participated in the\nfocus group and subsequent RUSF-DHA taste test. All\nparticipants were between 18 and 41 years of age, 16 to\n34 weeks of gestation, and 18 to 25 kg/m2of body mass\nindex. Approximately 50% of the women had completed\nsecondary schooling, while 18% had completed only pri-\nmary school. The remaining participants had some ter-\ntiary education and training. An outline and summary of\nthe Interview Guide procedures and questions for the\ndiscussions are presented in Table 1and the complete\nfocus session transcript appears in Additional file 1.\nThe knowledge of the participants regarding nutri-\ntional needs during pregnancy was assessed by querying\ninformation about what special foods and supplements\nincluding vitamins should or should not be ingested dur-\ning pregnancy. There was a general consensus in each\nfocus group session that non-fatty foods, dairy products\nas a source of calcium, and foods containing iron should\nbe consumed on a daily basis (Table 2). The foods cited\nas containing these nutrients included milk, yogurt, liver,\nfish or kapenta . Other foods noted that should be eaten\nduring pregnancy included fruits and vegetables, ground\nnuts, beans and nshima , a corn-meal based porridge that\nis a staple of the local diet.\nAll participants acknowledged that vitamin supple-\nments are recommended during pregnancy for the\nhealth of the child, and further reported that these were\nprovided at no cost at the antenatal clinic or might be\npurchased at a pharmacy. Referring to the free vitamin\nsupplements, one participant commented that,\n\u201cYes, always when someone is pregnant they are\ngiven vitamins although we can \u2019t know what they doTable 1 Layout of the Interview Guide\n1.

A respondent stated,\n\u201c\u2026 there is no need to take since we already have a\ngood appetite for food \u201d.F02-R1\nParticipants indicated that s ome foods and beverages should\nbe avoided, including those that are high in salt and fat, soft\ndrinks, and alcohol. Smoking was also discussed for its nega-\ntive health impacts. One participant commented that,\n\u201cshe can eat anything unless if its causing her to\nhave nausea. \u201dF01-R2\nThis comment initiated a discussion of the negative im-\npact on appetite of strong odors and flavors during preg-\nnancy. There was also a discussion in one group about the\npractice of eating dirt or clay, a practice that is common\nin some cultures [ 24\u201326]. The participants acknowledged\nthat this practice was discouraged by healthcare workers.\nAssessment of fish consumption and knowledge of health\nbenefits of fish\nCertain fish species are a natural nutritional source of\nDHA [ 7,27]. Therefore, fish intake was extensively\nqueried and discussed. Thos e participants that ate fish\ndid so on average 2 \u20133 times per week; one participant\ns a i ds h ee a t si te v e r yd a ya n do n ed i dn o te a tf i s ha ta l l .\nFish was acknowledged as being a good nutritional\nstaple during pregnancy, bu t not specifically as related\nto brain or cognitive development of the fetus or infant.\nThat information was provided by the focus group fa-\ncilitators as part of the introduction describing the pur-\npose of the focus group and importance of DHA intake\nfor infant development (Additional file 1). The com-\nmon fish species purchased and consumed were:\nbream made up of common types of cichlidae similar\nto tilapia; mpulungu buka (Lates stappersi );kapenta ,a\ntype of fresh water sardine ( Limnothrissa miodon and\nStolothrissa tanganicae ); and chisense (Neobola nwer-\nuensis ). One participant mentioned eating mackerel.\nOf these, kapenta ,chisense and mackerel contain sig-\nnificant amounts of DHA (10% or more of the total\nfatty acids) [ 7,27].Kapenta intake was specifically\nqueried in the survey for this reason. Intake varied\nfrom none to 2 \u20133 times per week. It should be notedmost respondents who ate fish generally mentioned\nbream and buka, which are not significant sources of\nDHA [ 27,28].\nRUSF formulation\nA major goal of this work was to develop and assess an\nRUSF to contain fish oil as a method to deliver macro-\nnutrient and micronutrient supplements and DHA to\nwomen at risk for food insecurity and malnutrition dur-\ning pregnancy and lactation since this is a concern in\nZambia [ 5,29]. The lipid based nutrient supplements\nare deemed a valid delivery vehicle for DHA as the oils\nare miscible in the nut paste, low in water, as well as air\nand light tight, which helps to maintain the integrity of\nthe highly unsaturated fatty acids to prevent or reduce\noxidation [ 30]. The base of the RUSF-DHA developed\nfor this study was peanut butter, supplemented with\nnon-fat milk and whey powders, sugar, and mixed nat-\nural tocopherols as preservatives with a vegetable oil\nmixture as listed in Table 3. Additional micronutrients,\nincluding minerals and vitamins, were added as recom-\nmended [ 8]. Preliminary formulation tested DHA levels\nat 300, 600 or 900 mg per 20, 50 or 75 g of RUSF. We\nsought the highest dose palatable, based on aroma and\ntaste in small group tastings at Edesia, Inc. and UNL.\nThe 300 \u2013600 mg doses were equally accepted, while the\n900 mg dose was rated as having the strongest \u201cfishy \u201d\nodor and aftertaste. The final formulation of approxi-\nmately 400 mg DHA per 50 g supplement was selected\nto reach levels informed by studies in the US and else-\nwhere as suitable for optimal birth and infant develop-\nmental outcomes [ 14,22,31\u201335].\nFatty acid analysis of the final product indicated about\nhalf of the fat was monounsaturated, primarily oleic acid\nand about 13.5% was the saturated fatty acid palmitate\n(Table 4). The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (lino-\nleate and linolenate) comprised about 50% of the total\nfatty acids and the long chain highly unsaturated PUFA\nwere 3% total. As expected of the latter, arachidonic acid\nlevels were low at 0.24 mol% since an enriched source of\nthis long chain PUFA was not added, while EPA and\nDHA were 0.57 and 2.3 mol% total FA, respectively,\nfrom the fish oil. Since oxidation of DHA and other un-\nsaturated fatty acids could lead to reduced palatability\nand unfavorable odors (i.e. \u201cfishiness \u201d), a commercial\nassay was performed, which demonstrated no significant\nincrease in oxidized lipids over 6.5 months storage with\ntemperature (Fig. 1).\nComments on the RUSF-DHA while sampling the food\nAfter the discussion of diet and nutrition information, the\nparticipants were offered a 50 g sachet of the RUSF-DHA\nto taste, smell, and sample. Impressions of the food prod-\nuct were recorded and transcribed from the discussionsChunda-Liyoka et al.

BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:93 Page 10 of 14\nThe answers varied from only once per week, because of\nthe smell, to three times a day if the fish odor could be\nlimited. Most participants agreed that the RUSF-DHA\nwould be more likely to be acceptable for every day intake\nif mixed with another food such as rice or eaten as a\nspread on bread.\nWhile many participants expressed some concern\nabout the smell and flavor, it was generally agreed that\nthe health benefits to the developing child would take\nprecedence over taste and smell to drive the individuals\ntoward acceptance. In hedonic testing, the flavor actually\nrated quite high at 7/9, while the aftertaste was rated as\nmoderate at 4/9 on a scale of 9 (like extremely) to 1(dis-\nlike extremely) (Table 4). Generally, the participants\nagreed that if the RUSF-DHA provided nutritional bene-\nfit to the child \u2019s development, then it would be accept-\nable to pregnant and lactating women. One stated,\n\u201cI like it because it \u2019s important for the child \u2019s health\nwhich is critical, mothers should take it \u201d,F01-R6\nand another,\n\u201cI don \u2019t like it but just the nutrients will make me\ntake it .\u201dF02-R6\nAdditionally, it was mentioned that the smell might be\nless objectionable during lactation, rather than during\npregnancy when certain foods and odors can initiate\nnausea:\n\u201cI think the ones who are breastfeeding can like the\nproduct more than the pregnant mothers because\npregnant mothers become too choosey with food .\u201d\nF02-R3\nDiscussion\nIn the present work, we interrogated knowledge about nu-\ntrition during pregnancy and eating habits of pregnant\nwomen in an antenatal clinic population in Zambia where\nthere are high rates of food insecurity, malnutrition, and\nstunting. We also developed and evaluated acceptability of\na lipid based-RUSF formulation that contained fish oil to\nprovide a source of DHA. The RUSF-DHA was designed\nfor use by malnourished women during the first 1000\ndays, from conception through 24 months, during the crit-\nical period of brain and neuronal development [ 14]. The\nDHA dosage was based on studies in the U.S. and else-\nwhere that were aimed at evaluating DHA for improved\nbirth, cognitive, and developmental outcomes for women\nand their infants [ 15,34,36\u201338].\nDuring the focus group sessions, participants generally\nexpressed knowledge that certain food groups are re-\nquired for the health of the developing child, includingvegetables, fruit, milk and dairy products, beans, corn\nmeal porridge, meat, and fish. The responses reflected\nthe fact that the importance of a nutrient-rich diet dur-\ning pregnancy was generally acknowledged. Nutrition\ncounseling is routinely incorporated as part of the pre-\nnatal program offered by the UTH ANC in Lusaka.\nThus, the women were receptive of a relatively new con-\ncept that certain fats, namely DHA, were also important\nfor brain development of the child before and after birth.\nIn fact, the value of the nutrient, DHA, drove the accept-\nability of the RUSF, even though the sensory testing re-\nvealed a dislike for the smell of the food and some\naspects of the taste including an aftertaste.\nSince the supplement should be consumed daily over\nmonths during pregnancy and lactation, we also sought\nto determine acceptability in a population at high risk\nfor food insecurity. The final formulation contained ap-\nproximately 400 mg DHA per 50 g serving. The most\ncommon criticisms of the product were that it had a\nfishy smell and taste. Despite this finding, the product\nwas found to be acceptable because of its potential value\nto healthy birth and developmental outcomes for the\nchild. Ultimately, the development of the child took pre-\ncedence over the mothers \u2019tastes. It was generally agreed\nthat the 50 g supplement would be consumed for this\nreason, especially if added to another component of a\nstandard diet such as rice or bread.\nIt is noteworthy to mention that, while the RUSF-\nDHA product was designed for use by individuals at risk\nfor chronic malnutrition, the participants in this study\nwere not clinically malnourished as all fell within the\nrange of body-mass index (BMI) between 18 and 24 pre-\npregnancy. However, the need for the product by this\nclinic population overall is justified as it was determined\nduring enrollment that within the general client base of\nthe clinic, 23% (168/735) of women visiting for the first\nprenatal screening were clinically malnourished with a\npre-pregnancy BMI \u226416. The national population aver-\nage in Zambia for malnutrition is 17%, thus these mal-\nnourished women were excluded from the focus group\npanels to meet the inclusion criteria. However, the mal-\nnourished population is the ultimate target for the RUSF\nbeing developed to provide one supplement that will\nmeet all the various micronutrient needs of women dur-\ning pregnancy and lactation [ 24]. Additional studies are\nunderway in Zambia to assess the DHA status of preg-\nnant women and to examine the possible additional con-\nsequences of infectious disease including Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) where prevalence is 22%\nof pregnant women [ 1].\nBoth women and children diagnosed with severe or\nmoderate malnutrition have positive outcomes when\nprovided Ready to Use Therapeutic or Supplemental\nFoods (RUTF and RUSF, respectively) as part of theirChunda-Liyoka et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:93 Page 11 of 14\ntherapeutic care [ 8,12,24,39,40]. Studies surrounding\nsuch small quantity lipid based nutritional supplements\n(LNS) were the focus of the International Lipid-Based\nNutrient Supplements Project (iLiNS), which sought to\nevaluate a wide variety of impacts using various formula-\ntions of small quantity LNS (i.e. 20 g total daily) [ 11].\nEncouraging outcomes of some these trials included, for\nexample, increased birth size and length of infants of\nprimiparous women in Ghana taking a small quantity\n(20 g) RUSF daily from 20 weeks gestation until delivery\n[21,41,42]. Thus, RUSF are often recommended in\nchronic malnutrition to add essential nutrients to the\nstandard diet during food insecurity. Supplemental feed-\ning projects like the completed Rainbow Project in\nZambia further provide evidence for the value of RUTF\nuse [ 43]. Overall, in the present study the participants dis-\nplayed a general knowledge of the types of food that are\nrecommended for consumption during pregnancy to pro-\nvide adequate nutrient intake for mothers and infants.\nSome of this nutritional advice had been provided by the\nstaff of the ANC during clinic visits. While eating fish to\nprovide specific nutrients like DHA was not necessarily a\ncomponent of the participants \u2019prior knowledge base, fish\nare part of the standard diet for the population and are\neaten by most 2 \u20133 times per week. However, the type of\nfish purchased and consumed was variable and some com-\nmonly mentioned types including bream and buka that\nare not a good source of DHA [ 7,27].\nCommon sources of high DHA oils include certain species\nof fish (e.g. salmon, tuna, sardines) and/or algae [ 44\u201346]. In\nWestern cultures, dietary DHA levels are generally very low\nand dietary supplementation for pregnant and lactating\nwomen and infants is highly recommended [ 14,16,47]. No\nstudies have evaluated RUTF or RUSF supplemented with a\nDHA containing oil and only one has evaluated the combin-\nation of RUTF and fish oil capsules in a clinical trial setting\n[48]. Therefore, it remains controversial as to whether or not\nthere is value in adding DHA and/or limiting the ratio of n-6\nto n-3 fatty acids to improve health outcomes with these\nfood supplements. Additionally , not all food insecure popula-\ntions may require DHA supplementation. For example, if the\ntraditional diet includes fish high in DHA as a dietary staple,\nas is true in Malawi, such supplementation would be un-\nnecessary [ 49]. Therefore, it will be important to test the\nneed for the product based on assessment of the omega 3\nindex in blood in the underweight and malnourished popula-\ntion of Zambian women. If low, then supplementation with\nthe RUSF-DHA for outcomes related to fetal and infant de-\nvelopment, as well as birth outcomes, must also be evaluated\nin future studies.\nThere were limitations to this focus group study, includ-\ning the small numbers of participants. The size of the\ngroups was kept low at 7 \u20139 individuals to encourage con-\nversation and participation by all members of the group.The final number at 27 individuals followed recommenda-\ntions for this type of survey of climate and knowledge sur-\nrounding dietary behaviors and knowledge of nutrition\n[19]. The room chosen for the discussion sessions was also\nsuboptimal as non-participants could not be excluded\nfrom the room. The population of participants was limited\nto the greater urban area of Lusaka. Additional focus\ngroups are planned for rural locations in the future. Lan-\nguage may also have been a barrier to some individuals as\nthe introduction and discussion questions had to be trans-\nlated by the group facilitators to accommodate all partici-\npants. Despite these limitations, this study provided useful\ninsight into the beliefs and practices of nutrition in preg-\nnancy among ANC UTH clients.\nConclusions\nThe participants expressed willingness to accept new in-\nformation regarding the need for essential fatty acids,\nparticularly DHA, for the health of their infants during\npregnancy and lactation. It was apparent that additional\nknowledge regarding the benefits of fish as a source of\nprotein, vitamins, and essential fatty acids is needed as\npart of the nutrition and clinical services provided. Spe-\ncifically, there should be education about including those\ntypes of fish that are high in DHA such as kapenta in\nthe standard diet. As mentioned above, it is also critical\nto conduct additional studies to evaluate DHA supple-\nmentation as the RUSF-DHA for food insecure and mal-\nnourished women in pregnancy and lactation. For the\nwell-nourished population, increased levels of DHA in-\ntake should be encouraged by counseling to eat kapenta\nand other high DHA-containing fish.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10.\n1186/s12884-020-2783-8 .\nAdditional file 1.
