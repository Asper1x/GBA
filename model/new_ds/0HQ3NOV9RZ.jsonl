Due to its highmoisturecontentandsusceptibilitytomicrobialattack,freshginger spoils quickly. Inappropriate storage conditions can\nreduce the quality of fresh ginger, characterised by drying\nloss,senescence,andputrefaction[2].Teprimarycausesofspoilage are improper postharvest handling, the growth ofspoilage microbes, the action of naturally existing enzymes,chemical reactions, and structural changes during storage[3]. Fresh ginger is generally preserved using modifed andcontrolledatmospherepackaging,chemicaltreatmentssuchas colour fxing agents or inorganic salts, low temperature,and edible coatings, all of which are similarly used forfruit and vegetable preservation [4]. Furthermore, manyeco-friendly postharvest treatments have been utilized forpreservation of vegetables and fruits as well as stress re-duction, including chitosan, oligochitosan [5], eugenol [6],humic acid, and methyl jasmonate [7, 8].\nChitosan is a linear polysaccharide made up of glu-\ncosamine and N-acetylglucosamine, connected by \u03b2-1,4-\nglycosidic linkages. It is obtained by partial deacetylation ofchitin. Te main distinction between chitin and chitosan isthe proportion of acetyl groups in their chemical structures\n[9]. It is frequently utilized as a material to produce bio-\ndegradable flms and microbe-resistant food preservatives.Te presence of positively charged amine groups in thepolymerstructurehasantibacterialproperties.Chitosanaidsin the preservation of fruits and vegetables by acting asa barrier to moisture, O\n2, and CO 2[9]. Chitosan and oli-\ngochitosan can suppress the rotting of ginger rhizomesduring storage because they can increase the activity ofdefence enzymes in ginger [5]. When applied to plants,chitosan exhibits three activities: (i) elicitation of hostWiley\nScientifica\nVolume 2024, Article ID 2054943, 8 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2024/2054943\ndefences, (ii) antimicrobial action, and (iii) formation of\nflms on the treated surface [10].\nAnother potential coating material is beeswax. Beeswax\ncoating can maintain the moisture content and quality ofrhizomes. Waxes are esters of long-chain unsaturated fattyacids with long-chain monohydrate alcohols or sterols [11].\nTebeeswaxcoatingstudy,whichincludedacombinationof\n4% beeswax coating with the addition of paclobutrazol(1,500ppm),wasabletosuppressafairlylargepercentageofwhite ginger rhizome sprouts when stored at a temperatureof 20\u201322\n\u00b0C for three months [12]. Te diferent storage\nfacilities have reportedly impacted physicochemical prop-erties such as pH, total soluble solid (TSS), total solid (TS),acidity, and water activity [3].\nPolysaccharides and proteins are outstanding materials\nto form coatings and flms, displaying extraordinary me-chanical properties. However, they have a limited barrier\nagainst moisture transfer. Tis limitation does not apply to\nlipids with high melting points, such as beeswax and car-nauba wax [13]. Lipid-based compounds have been widelyused as coating formers that efectively reduce loss of waterand fruit surface erosion, enhance mechanical rigidity, andcontrol inner gas composition [14].\nCoatings can be formulated using either a single com-\npound or a combination of compounds using the layer-by-layer method, producing a multilayer coating with highreliability under varied environmental stresses [15]. A bi-layercoatingthatcombineschitosanwithcarnaubawaxhasbeen tested on strawberries and demonstrated positive ef-\nfects in conserving frmness and reducing weight loss [9].\nOther research suggested that coating blueberry fruits withchitosan and aloe vera efectively reduced mold contami-nation and water loss compared to uncoated fruits [16].\nStorageisanimportantstageinpostharvestginger,as\nproper storage ensures that its quality is maintained fora long period of time. Cold storage is recommended as itsignifcantly extends the shelf life of the commodity. Teoptimal storage conditions for fresh ginger are 13\u2013 15\n\u00b0C\nwith a relative humidity of 90\u201395% [17]. Casimero et al.[18]suggestthattheappropriatetemperatureandrelative\nhumidity for storing fresh ginger are 12\n\u00b0C and RH 75%.\nTerefore, the availability of cold storage facilities is es-\nsential to preserve the quality of ginger. However, theimplementation of cold storage is prohibitively expensivefor most ginger producers, particularly small-scalefarmers, due to the required postharvest infrastructureand facilities. Consequently, this research proposes theutilization of moderate temperatures (around 18\n\u00b0C)\nachievable through more afordable air conditioning(AC), providing a feasible alternative compared to coldstorage. Fresh ginger will be negatively afected when the\nstoragetemperatureexceeds18\n\u00b0C,asthegerminationrate\nincreases.To date, no information has been found regarding the\nefectofthedoublelayercoatingofchitosanandbeeswaxon\nthe physicochemical properties of ginger during storage,namely,themoistureandphenoliccontent,weightloss,TSS,and surface morphology. Tis study aims to evaluate thephysicochemicalpropertiesofthegingerbilayercoatedwith\nchitosan and beeswax during storage at diferent tempera-\ntures (18 and 25\n\u00b0C) for up to 6months.\n2.Materials and Methods\n2.1. Preparation of Coating Solution. Te coating solution\nconsisted of chitosan solution and beeswax emulsion. Achitosan solution was prepared by referring to the methoddeveloped by Liu et al. [5]. Chitosan was dissolved in HClsolution(1%)atconcentrationsof1.5and3%.TepHofthesolution was adjusted to 5.5 with the NaOH solution.\nBeeswax emulsion was prepared according to the\nmethoddevelopedbyYulianietal.[19].Beeswaxwasmeltedat 95\u00b15\n\u00b0C and then mixed with Tween 80 at a ratio of 1:1.\nOleicacidandtriethanolamine(eachatapercentageof50%\nofbeeswax)wereaddedwhilestirredwithamagneticstirrer.\nTe resulting solution was added to the hot distilled water(95\u00b15\n\u00b0C)whilemixingwithanultra-turraxhomogenizerat\na speed of 11,000rpm to form an emulsion solution.\n2.2. Application of Coating Solution. Te coating solution\napplication was performed by immersion and spraying. Te\nginger rhizome was dipped into chitosan solution (A; A1:1.5%and A2: 3%) for 10minutes and then air-dried (25 \u00b12\n\u00b0C, RH\n82%\u00b11%).Tesecondlayerofcoatingwasappliedbyspraying\nthebeeswaxemulsion(B;B1:3%andB2:6%)onthesurfaceofthe air-dried chitosan-coated ginger rhizomes. Te double-coated ginger was then air-dried with the help of a fan over-night.Teair-drieddouble-coatedginger(500g)waspackedinperforatedpolyethyleneplasticbags(diametersof2-3mm)andstoredatroomtemperature(25 \u00b12\n\u00b0C,RH82%\u00b11%)andinan\nair-conditioned room (18\u00b0C). Ginger without coating or\npackaging was also stored as a control sample.\n2.3. Physicochemical Property Analysis\n2.3.1. Moisture Content. Moisture content was measured\nusing a gravimetric method (drying in an oven). Te ginger\nsample(20g)wasplacedintoapreweightedaluminiumcup.Te sample was then dried in an oven (Memmert type UN\n55, Germany) at 105\n\u00b0C. Drying was carried out until there\nwas no further weight loss, or around 24hours. Te dried\ngingers were then cooled in a desiccator for 15minutes andthenweighed.Temoisturecontentwascalculatedusingthefollowing equation [20] and expressed as a percentage ona wet basis (%, w.b.):2 Scientifca\nmoisturecontent (%,wetbasis) \ufffdinitialweight \u2212finalweight\ninitialweight\u00d7100%. (1)\n2.3.2.TotalPhenolicContent. Tetotalphenoliccontentwas\ndetermined according tothe method of Singletonand Rossi\nwith [21] slight modifcations. An extract sample and\nmethanol were mixed to create a 500mg/L solution. After\nthat, 40\u03bcL of the mixture was put into a well plate, and\n150\u03bcL of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu was added. Following a 5-\nminute rest period, 150 \u03bcL of 6% Na 2CO3was added, and it\nwas then left at room temperature for an additional90minutes.Inthisanalysis,gallicacidwasusedasastandardof measurement to calculate the amount of gallic acidequivalent/g of extract (GAE mg/g). With an Elisa ReaderSynergy HTX, the absorbance of the extract at awavelengthof 725nm was determined.\n2.3.3.TotalSolubleSolid(TSS). TeTSSwasmeasuredusing\nthe method described by Milosenic et al. [22]. Te TSS was\nmeasured from extracted ginger juice in triplicate using theAtago DR-A1 digital refractometer (Atago Co. Ltd., Tokyo,Japan) at a temperature of 28 \u00b11\n\u00b0C. Te TSS was expressed\nin Brix.\n2.3.4.GingerPeelSurfaceStructure. Tesurfacestructureof\nthe ginger peel was observed using the technique developed\nby Konarska [23] with slight modifcations. First, thegingerpeelwasdriedbyafreezedryeratatemperatureof \u221255\n\u00b0Cfor\n24hours and sliced into 5mm \u00d75mm in size. Next, the\nsamples were coated with gold (Au) using a sputter coater(Merck Quorum Type Q150R ES, sputter time: 60seconds,sputter current: 20mA). Finally, the samples were observedby scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a Merck ZeissType Evoima10 with an electron high tension (EHT) of16kV.\n2.3.5.DataAnalyses. Teresultswereexpressedwithaone-\nway analysis of variance at each storage period. Te data\nwerereportedasthemean\u00b1standarddeviation(Sd)ofthree\nreplications. All statistical analyses were carried out usingthe SAS Portable 9.13 software.\n3.Results and Discussion\n3.1. Moisture Content. Tere were changes in the physico-\nchemical properties of coated ginger during storage atdiferent temperatures. Te moisture content of gingershowed signifcant diferences, both coated and uncoated,andbothstoredat18\n\u00b0Cand25\u00b0C(Figure1).Gingerstoredat\n18\u00b0Chadhighermoisturecontentsthanthosestoredat25\u00b0C.\nAfter six months of storage, ginger coated with 3% chitosanand 6% beeswax had the highest moisture content, bothstoredat18and25\n\u00b0C(74.85%and60.05%,respectively).Te\ncoating of ginger can maintain moisture, its natural colour,texture, and aroma [24, 25]. Chitosan coating aids in thepreservationoffruitsandvegetablesbyactingasabarriertomoisture, O\n2, and CO 2[9].\n3.2.WeightLoss. Gingerstoredatatemperatureof25\u00b0Clost\nmore weight than that stored at an 18\u00b0C temperature\n(Figure 2). Commonly, during storage, the weight lossincreases due to the physiological processes of respiration,\ntranspiration, and other processes by which ethylene gas\nand some volatile compounds may be lost [26]. Te res-pirationprocessproducesCO\n2gas,water,andenergy[27].\nTese activities continue during storage and cause thepercentage of weight loss to increase. Storage at 18\n\u00b0C\nresulted in much smaller weight loss than that at 25\u00b0C\n(Figure 2). According to Taghavi et al. [28], the storage ofrhizomes at low temperatures may prolong storage andreduce weightloss andsprouting; however, this may resultin a higher pathogen incidence than storage at ambienttemperature. In addition to the efects of temperature, the\nresults of this study may indicate a protective function of\nchitosan and beeswax coatings. Te chitosan and beeswaxcoatings cover the stomata on the surface of the ginger,creating a barrier and thus reducing the rate of transpi-ration and respiration. Foo et al. [29] revealed thatchitosan-beeswax coating successfully reduced weight lossand microbial infection while maintaining total solublesolids, fruit frmness, and skin colour of sapodilla fruits.Sultan et al. [30] also obtained similar results on Le Contepears coated with chitosan-beeswax-pollen grains, whichsignifcantly reduced weight loss compared to uncoated\nsamples (control).\n3.3. Phenolic Content. Phenolic compounds are charac-\nterised by the nearness of phenolic hydroxyl, which is in-\ncluded in polyphenols, which are an imperative portion of\nbioactive compounds [31]. Phenolic compounds in gingerinclude gingerol and its derivatives, which have antioxidantactivities [1, 32]. Te presence of phenolic compounds isusually used against pathogen attacks or in response tostressfulenvironments [33].Te phenoliccontenttendedtodecrease during storage at all temperatures (Figure 3). Tephenolic content of ginger stored at 18\n\u00b0C was higher than\nthat stored at 25\u00b0C. Tis was diferent from that observed in\nginger coated with konjac glucomannan, in which the totalphenols decreased during the frst 3days and then slightly\nincreasedattheendofstorageforthe15-daystorageperiod\n[8]. A similar trend was found in the total phenols of theuncoated ginger, which tended to be higher than that in thecoated one for the entire storage period, especially at theambient temperature. After 6months of storage at 18\n\u00b0C,\nginger coated with 3% chitosan and 6% beeswax had thehighest phenolic content (27.56mg/100g). Te coatingcould delay the release of bound phenolic during storage,resulting in a higher phenolic content over time [34].Te phenolic content ranged from 14.99mg/100g toScientifca 3\n27.56mg/100g and 17.56mg/100g to 23.85mg/100g of\nginger stored at 18\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C, respectively.\n3.4.TotalSolubleSolid(TSS). Te total soluble solids (TSS)\ntendedtofuctuateduringstorage(Figure4).TedecreaseinTSSduringstoragewascausedbythelevelsofsimplesugars,which changed to alcohol, aldehydes, and amino acids [35].Te phenolic compounds also contain organic acids, amino\nacids, and pectin besides sugar [36]. Te temperature was\none of the factors that afected the increase in TSS. Gingerstored at 18\n\u00b0C had signifcantly higher TSS than the other\nstored gingers in the ffth week of storage [18]. Te increasein TSS might also be associated with a reduction in productmoisture content during storage time [37]. Ginger stored at25\n\u00b0CshowedhighervaluesofTSSthanthosestoredat18\u00b0C.\nFurthermore, after 6months of storage, the TSS rangedbetween4and6\n\u00b0Brixat18\u00b0C.Tenat25\u00b0Ctemperature,TSS\nwas found 8.5 to 11\u00b0Brix. Te hydrolysis process of poly-\nsaccharides into monosaccharides and oligosaccharides willincrease the TSS content [38]. Te coating treatment of 3%chitosanand6%beeswaxinfreshgingerdelaysthedecreaseof TSS during storage at 18\n\u00b0C. It shows that this treatment\ndelays amino acid and antioxidant degradation.\n3.5.GingerPeelSurfaceStructure.

Te coating of ginger with3% chitosan and 6% beeswax could maintain the moistureand phenolic content, delay weight loss, and delay the in-crease in TSS and cell compartment size for 6months ofstorage. Furthermore, these results indicate the industrialapplication potential of the coating treatment and storagetemperature conditions in maintaining the qualityof gingerduring long-term storage. Future research can expand ourunderstanding of the efects of coating on broader gingerproperties and explore various coating formulations andapplication techniques to enhance their efectiveness inextending the shelf life of ginger and other products.\nData Availability\nTe data used to support the fndings of the study are in-\ncluded in the article.\nConflicts of Interest\nTe authors declare that they have no conficts of interest.\nAuthors\u2019 Contributions\nH,SY,andCWdesignedthestudyandtheoutline.H,ABA,\nCH, and TH carriedout thereview, drafted themanuscript,\nTreatment Surface of ginger Cross-sectional sections of the ginger\nA1B1\nA1B2\nA2B1\nA2B2\nControlFigure5:Imagesofscanningelectronmicroscopes(SEM)ofgingerpeel,bothsurfaceandsectionalsections,withamagnifcationof100x.6 Scientifca\nperformedthestatisticalanalysis,coordinatedthestudy,and\ncontributed to the write-up of the manuscript.
