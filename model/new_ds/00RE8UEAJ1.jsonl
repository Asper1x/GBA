The interaction of macromolecular polymers is a significant \nissue in the formulation of fabricated products, for instance, the tex -\nture of dairy products (Benichou et al., 2007; Corredig et al., 2011; \nGuzey & McClements, 2006; Naji-  Tab asi et al., 2019; Schmitt \net al., 1998; Tolstoguzov, 1997).\nPolysaccharides are hydrophilic compounds without surface \nactivity used in the aqueous phase due to the thickening agents to \nmodify the rheological behavior of food products. One of the hy -\ndrocolloids which is widely used in food industries is xanthan gum \n(XG). It is an extracellular anionic polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 106 Da, which is created by Xanthomonas campestris  \n(Bertrand & Turgeon, 2007). XG aqueous solutions generate high \nviscosity and pseudoplastic behavior. They have remarkable effi -\nciency and stability over wide pH, temperature, and salt content \nranges surveyed in further research ( Murad et al., 2019; Naji \net al., 2012). The interaction of XG with other polysaccharides \nlike galactomannans or by cross-  linking in the presence of metal \nions formed a gel. The molecular structure prohibits gel formation \nby itself ( Bertrand & Turgeon, 2007). Also, the hydrophobic and \nelectrostatic interaction between XG and protein has been proved. \nThe formed hybrids can provide synergistic effects on the emulsi -\nfying and abilities of biopolymers and increasing the steadiness of \nemulsion droplets against coalescence and flocculation ( Benichou \net al., 2007).Received: 27 July 2021\u2003 |\u2003 Revised: 15 September 2021\u2003 |\u2003 Accepted: 16 September 2021\nDOI: 10.1002/fsn3.2624  \nORIGINAL RESEARCH\nInfluence of calcium chloride and pH on soluble complex of \nwhey protein-  basil seed gum and xanthan gum\nMozhdeh Sarraf1\u2003|   Sara Naji-  Tabasi2\u2003|   Adel Beig-  babaei1\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creat  ive Commo  ns Attri  bution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, \nprovided the original work is properly cited.\n\u00a9 2021 The Authors.

One way to control the \npolysaccharide\u2013  protein interaction is the variation of acidic and ionic strength. In this \nresearch, the different amounts of pHs (3\u2013  7) and calcium chloride (5\u2013  20 mM) were \ninvestigated on a soluble complex of whey protein concentrate (WPC) with xanthan \ngum (XG) and basil seed gum (BSG). The complex characteristic was investigated ac -\ncording to turbidity, viscosity behavior, and electrostatic interactions. The turbidity \ntest showed that WPC:BSG and WPC:XG absorbance increased at pH 3.5 and 4.5, \nrespectively, due to the formation of insoluble complex. pH 6 was the start point of \nthe turbidity increment, which showed the formation of soluble complexes between \nWPC and polysaccharides. The FTIR analysis confirmed creation of soluble complex \nat pH 6. The absorbance raised with increasing the molar of CaCl2 to 10 mM, but no \nsignificant difference was observed by turbidity test in the range of CaCl2<10 mM. \nAlso, the highest viscosity value was obtained by 10 mM CaCl2.\nKEYWORDS\nhydrocolloid, ionic strength, rheological behavior, turbidity\n\u2003\u2002 \u2003| \u20036729\nSARRAF et Al.\nOcimum Basilicum,  commonly known as Basil, belongs to the \nLamiaceae family is a one-  year-  old herb with small shoots and a fa -\nvorable aroma ( Dode et al., 2003; Padel et al., 2009). The secondary \nwall of basil seeds is covered with mucilage ( Avlani et al.,). Basil seed \ngum (BSG) with high molecular weight (2,320 kDa) is used as a stabi -\nlizer, fat replacer, controller of ice crystal growth, suspending agent, \nand emulsion stabilizer in the formulation of pharmaceutical suspen -\nsions and food products ( Avlani et al.,; Razavi et al., 2011; Razavi & \nNaji-  Tab asi, 2017; Zeynali et al., 2019). The rheological behavior of \nBSG affects the improvement of the functional properties of foods \n( Razavi et al., 2007). Previous research showed that the BSG could \ncreate a weak gel in the environment and increase the yield stress, \nand create a reversible gel with heat ( Rafe et al., 2012).\nWhey protein is extensively used as a food ingredient due to \nits useful and nutritious characteristics ( Arriaga, 2011). Also, it is \napplied as an emulsifier and a gelling agent. It is an available and \ncheap ingredient of by-  products in the dairy industry with powers \nof thickening and water-  binding capacity. In addition, it is consid -\nered as a nutritional compound in the formulation. By adsorption at \nthe emulsion droplet surface, whey proteins stabilize the network \nby creating an electrostatic barrier against flocculation and coales -\ncence. Whey protein concentrate (WPC) is a type of whey protein \nthat commercially contains 35 to 95% protein. The proteins help in \nwater binding and sometimes add to the gel matrix ( Dickinson, 2003; \nNayebzadeh et al., 2007). One of the essential features of whey pro -\nteins is gelation that can be obtained in different ways. The cold \ngelation process is one of them. Many factors affect the stability \nof whey protein emulsions, such as ionic strength, pH, thermal pro -\ncessing, aqueous phase, and emulsifiers ( Ye & Taylor, 2009; Zhong \net al., 2021). Hydrocolloids-  protein interaction can improve pro -\nteins\u2019 functionality. The main factors affecting electrostatic-  driven \ninteractions between proteins and polysaccharides are biopolymer \nration, biopolymer concentration, ionic strength, and pH ( Hosseini \net al., 2013; Khoshmanzar et al., 2013; Neirynck et al., 2007; Schmitt \n& Turgeon, 2011; Yang et al., 2021).\npH is one of the significant parameters effective in interact -\ning with protein-  polysaccharide complexes, and varying elec -\ntrostatic interaction creates soluble complexes or insoluble ones \n( Raei et al., 2018; Weinbreck et al., 2003a; Ye, 2008). Proteins \ncarry positive and negative charges on the medium pH and the \nelectrical charges toward various amino acids in the protein mol -\necules and their ionization mode in different pHs ( Ghosh & \nBandyopadhyay, 2012). The other important factor in the interac -\ntion between two biopolymers is strength of ionic compounds like \nNaCl and CaCl2. They decrease interaction between protein mole -\ncules and raise aggregation. It is also involved in the formation of \ncross-  linking between unfolded protein chains resulting in network \nformation ( Mulvihill & Kinsella, 1988). Ca2+ ions use as chelating \nagents in xanthan chains and other charged polysaccharides ( Patel \net al., 2020).\nThe purpose of the study was to investigate the interactions of \nWPC: XG and WPC: BSG at different pHs and concentrations of cal -\ncium. The other target was a comparison of function between two \ngums used that come from two various sources.2\u2003| \u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1\u2003 |\u2003Material\nBasil seeds were purchased from a local market (Mashhad, Iran). \nXanthan gum (Sigma, Germany) and whey protein concentrated \npowder (WPC) (Westland, New Zealand) were purchased. In ad -\ndition, sodium azide, hydrogen chloride (HCl), sodium hydroxide \n(NaOH), and calcium chloride (CaCl2) were supplied from Merck Co. \n(German). Deionized water was used to prepare all solutions.\n2.2\u2003|\u2003Extraction of Basil Seed Gum\nThe extraction of BSG was done according to the procedure of Naji- \nTabasi et al. 2016 ( Razavi et al., 2011). In brief, the distilled water \nwas added to seeds in a ratio of 20:1. They were mixed for 20 min at \n68\u00b0C, after which, the separation of mucilage from seeds was con -\nducted by a lab extractor by scraping technique. Then the mucilage \nwas mixed with ethanol 96% (1:3) to precipitate the polysaccharide. \nAfter dissolving in distilled water, the extraction was dried in an air- \nforced oven (Memert-  UF55: German) at 40\u00b0C.\n2.3\u2003|\u2003Preparation of Protein: \npolysaccharide complexes\nBSG and XG stock dispersions (0.1% w/w) and WPC (2% w/w) were \nprepared with deionized water. They were stirred for 2 hr and put in \nthe refrigerator for 24 hr to complete their hydration. 0.02% (w/w) \nsodium azide was added to prevent bacterial growth. The mixtures \nof polysaccharide-  protein were prepared in a ratio of 1:1. The solu -\ntions were stirred for 30 min to mix completely. Before carrying out \nexperiments, their pHs were justified with HCl and NaOH 0.1 N in \nthe range of 3\u2013  7 by a pH meter (Metrohm, Switzerland) ( Khalesi \net al., 2016; Naji-  Tab asi & Razavi, 2017b).\nTo consider the influence of calcium ion concentration on the \nsamples, the different concentrations of CaCl2 (5\u2013 20 mM) were \nadded to the selected treatment (soluble complex) of the previous \nstep according to analysis.\n2.4\u2003|\u2003Determination of Turbidimetric\nThe turbidity of solutions was determined using a DR-  500 UV-  visible \nspectrophotometer (Hach, Germany) at a wavelength of 633 nm \n(Naji-  Tab asi et al., 2019). All measurements were done in the ambi -\nent room.\n2.5\u2003|\u2003Determination of \u03b6 - potentials\nElectrostatic interactions were measured to investigate surface \ndensity changes around the newly formed hybrids between protein \n6730\u2003 |\u2003 \u2003\u2002\nSARRAF et Al.\nand polysaccharide molecules. \u03b6 - potential measurements were per -\nformed using the electrophoretic light scattering of Zeta Potential \n(Zeta Compact CAD, France) at 25\u00b0C ( Naji-  Tab asi et al., 2019). Each \ntreatment is measured three times.\n2.6\u2003|\u2003Determination of rheological behaviour\nViscosity properties were investigated with a viscometer (Brookfield, \nLV DVIII Ultra, USA) in the shear rate range of 0.1\u2013  100 s- 1 at 25\u00b0C by \na heating circulator (Julabo, Model F-  12- MC, Germany). A computer- \ncontrolled program was used to shear solutions ( Naji-  Tab asi & \nRazavi, 2017a).\n2.7\u2003 |\u2003Determination of FT-  IR\nThe functional groups of protein, gums, and soluble complexes of \nWPC: BSG, and WPC: XG were evaluated in powder form by Fourier \nTransform Infrared Spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet AVATAR 370, \nUSA) between wavelength 400 to 4,000 cm- 1 ( Faria et al., 2011; \nNaji-  Tab asi et al., 2019).\n2.8\u2003|\u2003Statistical analyses\nThe complete randomized factorial design was used for statistical \nanalysis. The data were analyzed by SPSS (ver.11.0) according to \nANOVA. The significant difference was obtained by Duncan's multi -\nple range tests at level 95%. Three replications were used for treat -\nments. The curved plotted by the software Excel 2013.\n3\u2003| \u2003RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n3.1\u2003 |\u2003The effects of pH on the solution turbidity\nFigure 1 shows the turbidity of the system as a function of pH. The \nturbidity of hydrocolloid dispersions was stable in pH of 3\u2013  7. The \nreason for the turbidity of polysaccharides is high molecular weights; \na polymer with a high molecular weight gives a higher adsorption \ndensity ( Garcia Vidal, 2013).Results analysis of protein turbidity in the absence of polysac -\ncharides showed that WPC absorbance raised with increasing pH \ntoward 4.5. A protein and an anionic polysaccharide carry opposite \nnet charges at pH <IP of the protein, resulting in a maximum electro -\nstatic attraction ( Xia & Dubin,). The major peak of WPC turbidity \nwas at pH ~ 4.5 that it shows IP of protein ( Gulzar, 2011). After this, \nthe increasing pH led to a decrease in turbidity. The electrostatic \nforce is an essential driving force in the solution and effects on ag -\ngregation and agglomeration ( Sun et al., 2008).\nInsoluble complexes are generated by binding anionic poly -\nsaccharides to cationic proteins at pH <pI. The charge of the pro -\ntein changes from negative to positive when the pH decreases to \nlower than the pI  of protein. The binding initially causes charge \nneutralization, which leads to the formation of an insoluble aggre -\ngation complex. However, binding anionic polysaccharides with \nprotein at pH >pI resulted in forming soluble complexes ( Ghosh & \nBandyopadhyay, 2012; Schmitt et al., 1998).\nThe most absorbance of WPC:BSG and WPC:XG solutions were \nobserved at pH 3.5 and 4.5, respectively, because of the insoluble com -\nplexes formation. Complexes of WPC:BSG and WPC :XG were generated \nbetween oppositely charged electrolytes. That means the most interac -\ntion occurred, and the final charge of the system is weak. The system \nturbidity declined with decreasing pH value sharply in complexes of BSG \n(3.5>) and gradually in complexes of XG (4.5 >), which may be related to \ncomplex dissolution. The results agreed with the other reports ( Hefnawy \n& Ramadan, 2011; Malhotra & Coupland, 2004; Raoufi et al., 2017).\nIn pH values more than PI , protein and polysaccharide net \ncharges are the same and cause soluble complexes. The complexes \nhave enough negative to be soluble. Because fewer proteins can in -\nteract with the polysaccharide as fewer charged moieties are acces -\nsible ( Naji-  Tabasi et al., 2020). There were no significant oscillations \nin both the complexes diagrams from pH 6\u2013  7 (Figure 1 a,b). As the \npH decreased to 6, the system's turbidity gradually started to in -\ncrease. The start point of increment showed the formation of soluble \ncomplexes between WPC and polysaccharides.\n3.2\u2003|\u2003The effects of pH on the \u03b6 - \npotentials of solution\nThe \u03b6- potential of solutions at different pH values from 4 to 7 is \nshown in Figure 2. It showed pH ~5 is the critical point for WPC. The \nFIGURE 1\u2003Turbidity measurement of \nWPC, XG, WPC: XG (a), and WPC, BSG, \nWPC: BSG (b) as a function of pH (3\u2013  7)\n33 .544 .5 55 .566.5 700.511.522.5\nWPC\nXG\nWPC:XGAbsorbance \npH\n33 .544 .555 .566 .5700.511.522.5\nWPC\nBSG\nWPC:BSGAbsorbance\npH(a) (b)\n\u2003\u2002 \u2003| \u20036731\nSARRAF et Al.\n\u03b6- potential of WPC was the most positive in pH 3. The pH values \naltered from + 21.72 to \u221224.82 as the pH increased from 4 to 7.\nThe \u03b6- potential value of BSG was negative between pH 4 -  7 . The \n\u03b6- potential of BSG was the most negative in pH 4 (Figure 2). Also, the \n\u03b6- potential of XG was negative in all pH.\n\u03b6- potential value of complexes illustrated a decreasing trend of \n\u03b6- potential value with addition polysaccharide to the WPC solution \ndue to raising the number of carboxyl groups on the side chains \n(Shiroodi, 2014). Therefore, the groups reduced at pH >PI of WPC, \nfollowing, \u03b6- potential of mixes trend toward negative charges (Raoufi \net al., 2017).\nWhen the pH decreased from 7 to 4, the \u03b6 - potential of com -\nplexes were more positive than pure hydrocolloid solutions that \nindicated the electrostatic complexes\u2019 formation with positive \ncharges ( Raoufi et al., 2017; Shiroodi, 2014). According to Figure 2, \npH ~6 can be considered as the start point of the soluble com -\nplex. Both, protein and polysaccharides had negative charge, but \nthey created complexes. According to the results of electrostatic \ninteractions and turbidity, the formation of insoluble WPC:XG and \nWPG:BSG complexes occurred at pHC 4.5 and 3.5, respectively .  \nShiroodi (2014) reported that the formation of soluble WPI and \nXCHC (xanthan curdlan hydrogel complex) complexes is attributed \nto the interaction between oppositely charged biopolymers, the \npresence of positive surface charges of protein, and negatively \ncharged XCHC ( Shiroodi, 2014).\n3.3\u2003|\u2003The effect of pH on rheological behavior\nAs a result, the flow curve of shear rate and apparent viscosity at \ndifferent treatments are presented in Figures 3 and 4.\nThe viscosities of BSG and XG decreased with increasing shear \nrate, which indicates a shear-  thinning behavior (Figure  4a, b). This \nbehavior has been reported in previous studies ( Naji et al., 2012; \nNaji-  Tab asi & Razavi, 2017b). In addition, viscosities declined with \nthe change in the pH toward more H+. The maximum viscosity was \ngained around pH 7, where the shape of hydrocolloid chains is close \nto the rod conformational state ( Achi & Okolo, 2004). Also, the vis -\ncosity of BSG had a higher viscosity than XG at pH 7. In general, \ncarboxyl groups are gradually ionized, the coils are expanded with \nraising pH because of electrostatic repulsion between the functional \ngroups in hydrocolloids, which causes intermolecular binding, and \nthe viscosity of solution increased ( Feng et al., 2007).\nAccording to the results obtained from hydrocolloid solutions, \npredictable results were shown WPC:BSG and WPC:XG complexes \n(Figure 4a,b). A decrease in viscosity was also observed after com -\nplex formation. Therefore, the coacervates are generated from elec -\ntrostatic interactions between the WPC and hydrocolloids at low \npHs ( Bastos et al., 2010). In both gums, the viscosity trends were \ndecreasing, although the WPC:BSG viscosity was still higher than \nthe WPC:XG viscosity at all pHs. The viscosity decreased noticeably \nafter creation complexes of WPC:BSG, and the viscosities decreased \nin all complexes by decreasing pH. There was no difference be -\ntween pH 5 and 6. WPC:XG complexes in all pHs had shear-  thinning property and there was no difference between the viscosities in dif -\nferent pH values.\n3.4\u2003|\u2003FTIR analysis\nFTIR spectrum analysis was conducted on protein and hydrocolloids \npowders, and dried WPC: BSG, and WPC: XG complex in pH = 6 \n(Figure  5) to be sure about creating soluble complex in these pH value.\nAs Figure 5 shows, the absorption of WPC at 3,299 cm- 1 cor-\nresponds to stretching vibrations of OH linked to NH2. Bands \n~ 2,900  cm- 1 are related to CH2 groups. The absorption at the wave -\nnumber 1640 and 1538 cm- 1 are a distinct band of primary amide of \nthe group (-  CO- NH2) and secondary amide of the group (-  CO- NH), \nrespectively, that well were characterized in the whey proteins. Also, \n~ 900\u2013  1400  cm- 1 is related to CO, CC, and COH groups. The most \nsignificant peak was the corresponding absorption of the crystal \n(~2000  cm- 1) ( Gbassi et al., 2012).\nThe most substantial adsorption peaks at 3,435 and 3,427  cm- 1 in \nXG and BSG, respectively, show the axial deformation of hydrogen- \nbonded OH. The graphs of BSG and XG showed that the absorption \nat the wavenumber ~ 1600\u2013  1654  cm- 1 is related to free carboxylate \ngroups. The absorptions at wavenumber 1,400 and 1,600 cm- 1 are \nassigned to C\u2013  OO symmetric and asymmetric stretching, respec -\ntively, which confirmed the presence of uronic acid. The peak found \nat ~1,300 cm\u22121 showed the deflection angle of CH. The peak located \nat ~1,000  cm\u22121 showed axial deformation of CO ( Faria et al., 2011; \nLi et al., 2016; Mohsin et al., 2018; Moosavi-  Nasab et al., 2010; Naji- \nTab asi et al., 2019).\nAs Fig.5 is shown, a peak in ~1073 cm-  1 of the complexes of \nWPC:BSG and WPC:XG is observed , which was reduced by increas -\ning hydrocolloids that be attributed to the non-  esterified carboxyl \ngroup( Gnanasambandam & Proctor,  1999).\nThe FTIR result of the isolated soy protein and BSG combina -\ntion showed that BSG altered the infrared spectrum of the protein. \nThe frequencies of the bands remained constant in amide I and II \nregions with adding BSG. In addition, other peaks were observed in \nthe range of 1160\u2013  1600 cm- 1, which are related to the interaction \nbetween amide groups of protein and hydrocolloid ( Jung, 2000). \nThere was an individual peak around 2,800 cm- 1, which indicates \nthe OH stretching of water molecules. When complex polymers are \nthermodynamically compatible and intermolecular interactions pre -\ndominate, the FTIR spectra of the compounds differ from those of \nthe constituent polymers.\nOn the other hand, a combination of two incompatible polymers \nproduces the FTIR spectrum in which the two polymers are superim -\nposed. The FTIR result strongly indicates that the two polymers are \nthermodynamically incompatible because the amide I peak increases \nin the protein and hydrocolloids. When blended polymers are ther -\nmodynamically compatible and intermolecular interactions prevail, \nthe resultant FTIR spectra of the combinations differ from those of \nthe component polymers ( Rafe & Razavi, 2015). Based on the test \nresults on different pHs, interaction of soluble complex was adjusted \nat pH = 6 ( Pilevaran et al., 2021).\n6732\u2003 |\u2003 \u2003\u2002\nSARRAF et Al.\n3.5\u2003|\u2003Effect of Calcium Chloride on the solution \nturbidity in pH = 6\nThe reason for adding calcium ions to the solution is reducing re -\npulsive negative charges between protein molecules and increasing \nthe tendency toward aggregation. It also affects the generation of \ncross-  linking between unfolded protein chains network aggregation \n( Rafe et al., 2013).Therefore, the effect of Ca2+ ion on WPC:XG and WPC:BSG tur -\nbid were studied at different concentrations of 5,10,15, and 20 mM \nin pH = 6 that are shown in Figure 6.\nAs can be seen, the turbidity increased in both of the mix -\ntures with increasing concentration of CaCl2. The absorbance of \nBSG:WPC and XG:WPC in 5 mM were 0.318 and 0.245, respectively. \nBut the increase value of turbidity decreased with increasing Ca2+ \nconcentration and absorbance of BSG:WPC and XG:WPC showed \n0.357 and 0.312, respectively.

The strength of whey protein gels increased( Kuhn & \nFoegeding, 1991; Mulvihill & Kinsella, 1988). The presence of salt \nconcentrations in solution affects gelation and texture profile be -\ncause of electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged and \nunfolded protein molecules ( Ju & Kilara, 1998).\n3.6\u2003|\u2003The effects of ca+ ion on rheological \nbehavior of solutions in pH = 6\nThe rheological properties of WPC:BSG and WPC:XG complex (pH \n6) at different concentrations of CaCl2 was shown in Figure 7. The \nresults showed a shear-  thinning behavior in the presence of calcium \non all samples.\nAs displayed in Figure 7a, at the low shear rate, the highest \nviscosity was observed in 10-  mM. However, it decreased by rais -\ning salt to 15 and 20 mM. The increase of salt concentration usu -\nally led to generate a complex with compact structure. Also, the biopolymer concentration continuously declined with the rise of \nsalt concentration in coacervates, which was related to the elec -\ntrostatic interaction between protein, and polysaccharide ( Wang \net al., 2007). The viscosity of WPC:BSG decreased in shear rate \nfrom 10 to 20 s- 1, and it was approximately stable until 100 s- 1 \n(Figure 7a). The most and least viscosity were observed at 10 and \n20 mM CaCl2, respectively.\nAbout the trend of WPC:XG complex, at first, the viscosity was \nat the highest point, and then it decreased and continued stably \n(Figure 7b), which shows shear-  thinning behavior in all complexes. \nBy comparing the viscosity of both hydrocolloids, BSG generated a \ncomplex with more viscosity than XG. Also, screening the charge is \ninfluential on the formation of the complex due to the decreasing \ninteraction, while the results showed it is less at low concentrations \n( Weinbreck et al., 2003b; Ye et al., 2006).\nThe presence of salt reduced the viscosity of solutions at dif -\nferent pHs As the pH increases, the viscosity decreases due to the \nmolecular cross-  linking between hydrocolloids such as xanthan and \ncalcium ions ( Hemmatzadeh et al., 2011).\n4\u2003| \u2003CONCLUSION\nIn the research, the effect of different calcium concentrations and \npHs on interactions of WPC:XG and WPC:BSG were investigated. \nThe results showed soluble or insoluble complexes, dependent on \nthe pH, can be established. Insoluble complexes were generated \nbelow the isoelectric point of WPC, where the protein and poly -\nsaccharides had opposite electrical charges. Soluble complexes \nwere also created at pH =5.5\u2013  6, where hydrocolloids were nega -\ntively charged, and whey protein had a slight net charge (due to \nthe positively charged patches on the whey protein surface). The \nFTIR analysis confirmed creation of soluble complex at pH 6. The \naddition of gums shifted the zeta potential of complex toward the \nnegative charge. Also, the hydrocolloids increased the viscosity of \nsystem, and result in shear-  thinning behavior.
