All \npublications reporting clinical trials or prospective \nobservational studies involving definitions of PEx in \npeople with CF published in English from January 1990 to \nDecember 2022 were included. Data were then extracted \nfor qualitative thematic analysis.\nResults A total of 14 039 records were identified, with \n7647 titles and abstracts screened once duplicates were \nremoved, 898 reviewed as full text and 377 meeting the \ninclusion criteria. Pre- existing definitions were used in \n148 publications. In 75% of papers, an objective definition \nwas used, while 25% used a subjective definition, which \nsubcategorised into treatment- based definitions (76%) \nand those involving clinician judgement (24%). Objective \ndefinitions were subcategorised into three groups: those \nbased on a combination of signs and symptoms (50%), \nthose based on a predefined combination of signs and \nsymptoms plus the initiation of acute treatment (47%) \nand scores involving different clinical features each with \na specific weighting (3%). The most common signs and \nsymptoms reported in the definitions were, in order, \nsputum production, cough, lung function, weight/appetite, \ndyspnoea, chest X- ray changes, chest sounds, fever, \nfatigue or lethargy and haemoptysis.\nConclusion We have identified substantial variation in \nthe definitions of PEx in people with CF reported in the \nliterature. There is a requirement for the development of \ninternationally agreed- upon, standardised and validated \nage- specific definitions. Such definitions would allow \ncomparison between studies and effective meta- analysis \nto be performed and are especially important in the highly \neffective modulator therapy era in CF care.\nINTRODUCTION\nLung disease remains the major cause of \nmorbidity and mortality in people with cystic \nfibrosis (CF).1 This is characterised by inter -\nmittent episodes of increased symptoms \nknown as pulmonary exacerbations (PExs).2 PEx are typically managed with antibiotics and \nintensified chest physiotherapy.3 4 If a PEx is \nsevere, then hospitalisation may be required.5 \nMultiple studies have demonstrated the clin-\nical importance of PEx in people with CF. In \naround a quarter of patients, there is a failure \nto recover to baseline lung function after \na PEx.6 7 Furthermore, PEx frequency has \nbeen associated with the rate of lung func-\ntion decline in both adults and children.8 \nUltimately, people who experience frequent \nPEx have reduced survival.9 PEx also impact \nquality of life and are associated with a finan-\ncial burden in terms of healthcare costs and \ntime away from employment.10 11\nDue to the importance of PEx, they are \nfrequently used as a primary or secondary \noutcome measure in clinical trials,12 for \nexample, trials of recombinant human \nDNase,13 tobramycin,14 hypertonic saline,15 \nazithromycin16 and CF transmembrane WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC\n \u21d2Pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) are clinically im-\nportant in cystic fibrosis (CF) and are frequently used \nas outcome measures in clinical research studies.\n \u21d2Multiple definitions of PEx exist.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS\n \u21d2Substantial variation in the types of definitions used \nfor PEx in people with CF was identified in this scop-\ning review.\n \u21d2Common themes in these definitions were identified, \nalong with a lack of age- specific definitions.\n \u21d2This limits the comparison between studies and ef-\nfective meta- analysis to be performed.\nHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, \nPRACTICE OR POLICY\n \u21d2There is a requirement for the development of inter -\nnationally agreed- upon, standardised and validated \ndefinitions of PEx in CF that are age- specific.\n \u21d2This is especially pertinent in the era of highly ef-\nfective CF transmembrane modulator therapies for \nmany people with CF.\n2\nAlmulhem\u00a0M, et\u00a0al.

A \nscoping review was felt to be most appropriate to examine \nthe extent, nature, range and variety of evidence on this \nextensive topic.19 These findings will feed into the devel-\nopment of consensus- based age- specific definitions by \nthe European Cystic Fibrosis Society Pulmonary Exacer -\nbation Working Group.\nMETHODS\nOverview\nThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews \nand Meta- Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRIS-\nMA- ScR) checklist was used to report our findings.20 The \nresearch question was developed using the \u2018PICo tool,\u2019 \nwhere P stands for population, I for interest and Co for \ncontext.21 We formulated the following research ques-\ntion: \u2018What definitions are reported for PEx in people \nof different age groups with CF in primary research \nstudies?\u2019. Alongside this, we also asked: \u2018What are the \nmost common signs and symptoms reported in defini-\ntions of PEx in people with CF?\u2019.\nCriteria for including publications\nTo get a comprehensive understanding of the defini-\ntions used in primary research studies, all clinical trials \n(randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and non- RCTs) and \nprospective observational studies that reported PEx as \nan outcome were included. Publications had to be avail-\nable in English and clearly specify a PEx definition used \nin people with CF of any age group. Studies published \nin abstract form only were considered. Authors were \ncontacted by email if publications were not accessible. \nReview articles, retrospective studies, case reports and in \nvitro and in vivo experimental studies were excluded.\nSearch strategy\nEmbase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus and \nCINAHL databases were searched between January 1990 \nand December 2022. A comprehensive search strategy \nwas developed in consultation with a librarian special-\nising in health databases. Medical subject headings and \nkeywords were used with \u2018AND\u2019 and \u2018OR\u2019 to narrow or \nbroaden the search, depending on the search strategy \nfor each database. Specific details outlining the search \nstrategies for each database can be found in the online \nsupplemental material. The following search terms were \nemployed: \u2018cystic fibrosis\u2019 AND \u2018pulmonary exacerba-\ntion\u2019, limited to English language and 1990\u20132022. Several pilot searches were run in each database to ensure that \nkey articles were identified. All the references were then \nimported into Endnote 20 reference management soft-\nware (Clarivate, London, UK). Duplication was checked \nusing different field settings, as suggested by Bramer \net al.22 After removing the duplicates, all results were \nexported to the Rayyan website23 to screen the title and \nabstract.\nStudy selection and data charting\nThe titles and/or abstracts of studies retrieved were \nscreened by the primary reviewer (MA). Decisions about \nthe inclusion or exclusion of studies were made between \ntwo reviewers (MA and MB). Eligible studies were then \nretrieved and assessed in full by the primary reviewer \n(MA). A second reviewer (MB) screened 10% of the \nincluded articles to ensure accuracy and agreement. \nAn electronic data recording form was designed for the \nspecific methodology used in the review. The form was \npiloted on three articles and subsequently optimised.\nData synthesis\nA thematic qualitative synthesis was used for this study24 \nto facilitate the systematic identification of prominent \nthemes and summarise definitions under these themes in \na structured way. Thematic synthesis has three stages: the \ncoding of text line by line, the development of descrip-\ntive themes and the generation of analytical themes.

BMJ Open Respir Res 2024;11:e002456. doi:10.1136/bmjresp-2024-002456 3Open access\ncharted data were pooled and then coded. Similarities \nand differences between codes were identified to begin \ngrouping them.25 Two main themes were developed from \nthe coded data based on clinical presentation and treat-\nment. For each theme, the frequencies of extracted defi-\nnitions were reported along with the signs and symptoms \nused.\nPatient and public involvement\nThere was no specific patient or public involvement in \nthis scoping review.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of articles identified by the search strategy\nIn total, 14 039 publications were identified by the search \nstrategy across all databases. The PRISMA flow diagram for the study is shown in figure 1. From these, 377 arti-\ncles met the inclusion criteria for the scoping review and \nwere included and analysed in the qualitative synthesis \n(the full list of included articles is provided in the online \nsupplemental material). These consisted of 272 obser -\nvational studies and 105 experimental studies. Most \nstudies were full articles, while 16 studies were available \nin abstract form only.\nThemes of definitions used for PEx\nTwo key themes were developed for PEx definitions \nused in the included articles. After manually coding the \ndefinitions, the definitions of PEx were categorised into \ntwo themes: those based on objective criteria and those \nusing subjective criteria, as per figure 2. The breakdown \nof studies: 94 (25%) studies used a subjective definition \nand 283 (75%) articles used an objective definition as \nshown in figure 3. The duration of signs and symptoms \nor length of the treatment course, was included in 23 \npublications. The duration of signs and symptoms varied \nfrom 3 days (nine studies), 5 days (four studies) or 7 days \n(five studies). Others delineated a minimum course of \ntreatment of 7 days to meet the criteria of PEx (three \nstudies), whereas others required the administration of \nan antibiotic course for 21 days (two studies).\nCommonly used definitions\nOut of the 377 articles reviewed, 148 studies used previ-\nously established definitions. There were six commonly \nused definitions that were identified from the analysis of \nthe articles, as shown in table 1. Full details of these defi-\nnitions are included in the online supplemental material.\nFigure 2 Pulmonary exacerbation definitions and themes.\nFigure 3 Frequency of pulmonary exacerbation definitions \nand themes reported in studies.\n4\nAlmulhem\u00a0M, et\u00a0al. BMJ Open Respir Res 2024;11:e002456. doi:10.1136/bmjresp-2024-002456Open access\nFuchs definition (1994)\nThe most commonly used definition was originally \npublished by Fuchs et al13 in a trial of nebulised recombi-\nnant human DNase. The Fuchs definition for PEx is based \non a combination of signs and symptoms (at least 4 out \nof 12 possible) and the need for intravenous antibiotics \nin people with CF aged >5 years. Various modifications of \nthe original Fuchs definition have been developed and \nused in studies. Typically, these involve an alteration of \nthe criteria for intravenous treatment or variations in the \nsigns and symptoms required.\nThese include:\n \u25baThe definition proposed by the EuroCareCF Working \nGroup in 2011.26\n \u25baThe \u2018expanded Fuchs criteria/definition\u2019 broadens \nthe definition to any oral, inhaled and/or intrave-\nnous antibiotics prescribed in response to the pres-\nence of 4 out of the 12 Fuchs criteria.18\n \u25baThe \u2018modified Fuchs criteria\u2019 involve only the pres-\nence of 4 out of 12 signs and symptoms without a \nspecified requirement for treatment.\nThese subtly different definitions have led to some \ninconsistency in their use and meaning in the literature. \nFor example, some studies use \u2018modified Fuchs\u2019 for the \nEuroCareCF Working Group definition,26 while others \nuse \u2018modified Fuchs\u2019 to mean the criteria described \nabove, where there is no requirement for intravenous \nantibiotic treatment.27 28 Another modified Fuchs defini-\ntion excludes one of the original 12 signs/symptoms.10 \nDue to this variation in terminology, some articles were \nexcluded from this review if they did not specify clearly \nwhich Fuchs definition was used (original, modified or \nexpanded).29 30\nUS CF Foundation (CFF) definition\nIn 2005, the CFF Microbiology and Infectious Disease \nConsensus defined a PEx as 3 out of 11 signs or symp-\ntoms being present. There was no specification of the \nage of the patient in the original definition. Studies \nhave used this definition in paediatric patients aged \n2\u201312 years,31 although it requires a measurement of \nforced expiratory volume in 1 s usually done for 6 years \nold and above only.\nThe Early Pseudomonas Infection Control (EPIC) definition\nThe EPIC definition published by Treggiari et al in 2009 \nis based on signs and symptoms and specifically applies \nto children with CF aged 1\u201312 years.32 It divides signs and \nsymptoms into four major and six minor criteria. A pres-\nentation involving one major and/or two of the minor \ncriteria signs or symptoms for a specified duration fulfils \nthe definition of a PEx. Some studies have also used the \nEPIC definition in adults and children aged over 12 \nyears.33 34 Another adjustment to the EPIC definition in \nsome studies is to shorten the duration of symptoms for \nthe minor criteria from 5 to 3 days.35 36Akron Pulmonary Exacerbation Score (PES) definition\nAn alternative method to objectively define a PEx is to \nuse a scoring system where each sign or symptom has a \nspecific weighting, with a total score greater than a prede-\nfined value being diagnostic of a PEx. The Akron PES37 \nwas designed for people with CF aged over 6 years. This \nscore contains 14 elements that are divided into systemic, \npulmonary signs and symptoms, and objective measure-\nments. A score of 5 or greater is required to meet the \ncriteria for a PEx. Although the original PES definition \nwas developed for a population aged over 6 years, it has \nbeen used in studies for participants down to the age of 6 \nmonths, for example, by Hoen et al.38\nRosenfeld definition\nThe Rosenfeld definition39 is another example of a score- \nbased method that involves two models. This score is \ndesigned for use in a population aged 6 years and above. \nIt was used in four publications that we identified.\nDefinitions used in different age groups\nOut of a total of 377 articles, only one of the included \nabstracts did not report participant age clearly. We subse-\nquently divided these populations into three groups: \nadult (aged \u226518 years), paediatric (<18 years) and mixed \nfor studies applying definitions to both age groups. We \nfound that in the specific paediatric and adult groups, \nan objective definition, defining PEx based on signs \nand symptoms, was the most commonly used. However, \na predefined combination of signs and symptoms and \nthe initiation of an acute treatment definition were used \nmost often in studies with a mixed age group (figure 4). \nA breakdown of the definitions used in studies involving \nthe different age groups is provided in table 2.\nCommonly used signs and symptoms in PEx definitions\nThe second aim of this review was to examine the signs \nand symptoms used in the different definitions of PEx. \nOut of the 377 included publications, 288 defined PEx \nusing signs and symptoms. The frequency of these \ndifferent signs and symptoms is shown in figure 5.

BMJ Open Respir Res 2024;11:e002456. doi:10.1136/bmjresp-2024-002456 5Open access\nCommon signs and symptoms (in 75% of included \nstudies) used in defining PEx were mainly respiratory \nsigns and symptoms such as an increase in the amount \nof sputum, increased cough and a decline in lung func-\ntion, followed by systemic features such as weight loss and \ndecreased appetite.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this scoping review highlight large \namounts of variation in definitions reported and used \nfor PEx in CF primary research literature. Some studies \nproposed their own novel definition of a PEx, with the \nremainder instead using definitions or elements derived \nfrom previous studies. This heterogeneity and lack of an \naccepted and validated standardised definition make it \nchallenging to design clinical trials with PEx as a clin-\nical outcome and limit meta- analysis and comparison of \nstudies. It may be argued that the lack of standardised \ndefinitions reduces the effectiveness and applicability of \nclinical research in CF at present.\nUsing a predefined combination of signs and symp-\ntoms is the most frequently used method to define PEx. \nThis approach has some objectivity and depends on clin-\nical presentation and parameters rather than clinical \ninterventions. However, there may still be inconsistencies in the symptoms and their duration used to define PEx. \nAnother factor that should be considered is the differ -\nence in clinical presentations between adults and chil-\ndren when determining which clinical characteristics \nbest define a PEx. The difference in reported signs and \nsymptoms in different age groups is illustrated by various \nstudies in this review.40\u201342 Arguably, there is no single \ndefinition that will fit all age groups, and criteria must \nbe age specific to be truly clinically relevant. Adult and \npaediatric populations vary in their ability to perform \nspirometry reliably, typical presenting symptoms40 41 and \nthe preferred route of treatment.43\nThe need for a change in treatment, most commonly \nprescribing antibiotics, is frequently part of the defini-\ntions used for PEx.44 45 Few would disagree that this is a \ncrucial intervention relevant to both patients and multi-\ndisciplinary clinical teams. However, there is variation \nin the threshold for recognising and treating PEx at \nmultiple levels in reality.46 Indications for oral, inhaled \nor intravenous antibiotics also vary between centres \nand individual clinicians. For these reasons, the use of \ntreatment- based definitions was not recommended by \nthe EuroCareCF Group26 and CFF,47 arguing that treat-\nment as a definition of PEx in CF should not stand alone \nbecause of rapid changes in treatment modalities.

This method was used in nine publications \nincluded in this review. This type of definition is open to \nvariability and bias depending on physicians\u2019 preferences \nand backgrounds. Such a definition is ineffective as a \nclinical outcome in clinical trials. Two scoring systems to \ndefine PEx were found in the included literature. These \nscores were based on clinical assessment and were inde-\npendent of treatment decisions.37 39 The advantage of \nthese scoring methods is that they do not rely on thera-\npeutic decisions as recommended by the CFF Consensus \nConference on Outcome Measures for Clinical Trials47 \nand the EuroCareCF Group26 because of rapid develop-\nments in treatment modalities.\nRather than definitions based on clinical presentation \nand/or treatment, patient- reported indicators of PEx \nhave been suggested to help recognise PEx at an earlier \nstage and facilitate prompt intervention.40 41 Abbott and \ncolleagues40 interviewed adults with CF who experienced \nexacerbations. They asked them to report symptoms \nexperienced during PEx and how they consequently \nrecognised when these had resolved.40 For many patients, \nthe onset of an exacerbation was recognised by fatigue \nand alterations in sleep, cough, sputum, appetite, mood \nand daily activities. When describing the improvement, \nthey reported enhancement mainly in the activity level, ability to sleep, cough and less sputum production. Abbott \nand partners extended their work to include children, \nusing the same method.41 They found that, in general, \nthe most frequently reported symptoms for the onset of \nexacerbations were tiredness and increased cough and \n\u2018cold\u2019 symptoms, while in moderate or severe disease, \nactivity- induced breathlessness, sleep disturbances and \nmood fluctuations were most common.41 Those with \nsevere disease also reported increases in sputum produc-\ntion and lack of appetite.41 The child- reported indicators \nof PEx tended to map onto those reported by adults, with \nsome exceptions.41 Although these findings support the \nconcept that there are similarities between reported indi-\ncators of PEx across the CF lifespan, developing tools to \nmonitor the progression of the disease, requisite inter -\nvention and progression of treatment that are applicable \nto all ages is likely to be challenging.49\nThis scoping review\u2019s strengths involve the comprehen-\nsive search strategy of five large and reliable databases \n(Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus and \nCINAHL) and seek to summarise the entire range of PEx \ndefinitions reported in the primary research CF litera-\nture. The review covers a long period from 1990 to 2022, \nand we performed an extensive review of the reference \nlists from relevant studies to avoid missing other poten-\ntially important papers. However, the review was limited \nto studies in English only, potentially missing some rele-\nvant non- English papers.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis scoping review affirms that there is no single unified \ndefinition of PEx in people with CF used in the research \nFigure 5 Most common signs and symptoms used in pulmonary exacerbation definitions.\nAlmulhem\u00a0M, et\u00a0al. BMJ Open Respir Res 2024;11:e002456. doi:10.1136/bmjresp-2024-002456 7Open access\nliterature. Rather, several unvalidated definitions are \ncommonly used, with considerable variation between \nthe different definitions. This inconsistency in defining a \nPEx is almost certainly detrimental to clinical research by \nmaking comparisons of studies challenging and limiting \nmeta- analysis. There is a need for internationally agreed- \nupon and age- specific definitions of PEx that include \nspecific signs and symptoms and the need for treatment. \nMoving forward, definitions should reflect the impact of \nhighly effective CFTR modulators on the clinical charac-\nteristics of PEx in people with CF who are eligible.50 We \nsuggest that consensus- based definitions for PEx could be \nreached by integrating the criteria of the PEx definitions \nfound in this review together with the opinion of multi-\ndisciplinary experts, practising healthcare professionals \nand people with CF themselves.\nX Malcolm Brodlie @malc_brod\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge support from the European Cystic Fibrosis \nSociety Working Group on Pulmonary Exacerbation.
