During ontogeny, changes in the epigenetic state that\nshape morphological and functional differentiation of several brain areas can affect embryonic fetal\ndevelopment. Many epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation,\nhistone modi\ufb01cations, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs control brain gene expression,\nboth in the course of neurodevelopment and in adult brain cognitive functions. Epigenetic alterations\nhave been linked to neuro-evolutionary disorders with intellectual disability, plasticity, and memory\nand synaptic learning disorders. Epigenetic processes act speci\ufb01cally, affecting different regions based\non the accessibility of chromatin and cell-speci\ufb01c states, facilitating the establishment of lost balance.\nRecent insights have underscored the interplay between epigenetic enzymes active during embryonic\ndevelopment and the presence of bioactive compounds, such as vitamins and polyphenols. The fruit\nofManilkara zapota contains a rich array of these bioactive compounds, which are renowned for their\nbene\ufb01cial properties for health. In this review, we delve into the action of each bioactive micronutrient\nfound in Manilkara zapota , elucidating their roles in those epigenetic mechanisms crucial for neuronal\ndevelopment and programming. Through a comprehensive understanding of these interactions,\nwe aim to shed light on potential avenues for harnessing dietary interventions to promote optimal\nneurodevelopment and mitigate the risk of neurological disorders.\nKeywords: vitamins; phytochemicals; neurodevelopment assessments; maternal health outcomes; microbiota\n1. Introduction\nNeurodevelopment is a \ufb01nely orchestrated process starting from gestation that con-\ntinues until adulthood [ 1]. For the correct formation of the nervous system, the prenatal\nphase is extremely sensitive to lifestyle habits and environmental stimuli because of dy-\nnamic neurobiological events that occur during gestation. The maternal diet signi\ufb01cantly\nin\ufb02uences the development of a healthy brain in the growing fetus, exerting a profound\nimpact on its future functionality [ 2]. Variations in nutrition have potentially long-period\nconsequences on offspring health and tendency to disorders later in life [ 3]. The epigenome\nbegins to be encoded in the uterus and, during this period, the developing fetus is ex-\ntremely vulnerable to nutritional status. During ontogenesis, variations in epigenetic status\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16142225 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 2 of 22\nimpact differentiation of precursor cells into their mature state [ 4], affecting embryo\u2013fetal\ngrowth, and shaping the morphological and functional differentiation of the various brain\nregions. Additionally, it organizes embryo\u2013fetal tissues and organs in response to the\nchanging extra-uterine milieu by the modulation of metabolic\u2013immuno\u2013neuro\u2013endocrine\npathways [ 5]. Epigenetic machinery connects genes, the environment, and susceptibility\nto diseases. It embraces all those heritable modi\ufb01cations such as histone tail modi\ufb01ca-\ntions, DNA methylation, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs\nthat cause variations in gene expression without altering DNA coding sequences [ 6], in\nthis manner in\ufb02uencing gene transcription arrangements via various mechanisms and\nby controlling the reachability of genomic loci to numerous regulatory factors such as\nenhancers, silencers, and transcription factors [ 4]. Nowadays, there is an extraordinary\nfocus on identifying available periconceptional nutrients that can affect the epigenetic\nstate of the offspring and understanding how they can impact phenotypically. The critical\nwindow of vulnerability spans the \ufb01rst 1000 days from conception to the end of age 2, a\nperiod during which epigenetic mechanisms can signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uence neurodevelopmen-\ntal stages, namely neurogenesis, cell migration, differentiation, and synaptogenesis [ 7].\nNeurulation starts in embryonic life, occurring on day 18 after conception and continuing\nuntil day 28 [ 3]. The sequence of cellular processes includes neurogenesis at day 42 to\nmid-gestation, followed by migration, differentiation, synapse formation, and apoptosis [ 8].\nIn the course of neurodevelopment, the epigenetic program organizes the development of\nthe embryonic structures of the central nervous system, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity.\nAltered epigenetic programming has been involved in the etiology of numerous neuro-\nlogical development conditions. Neurodevelopment is a particularly vulnerable phase\nto speci\ufb01c nutritional de\ufb01ciencies [ 9]. Therefore, malnutrition in the early stages of life\ncan favor dramatic and long-lasting alterations in development, leading to neurological\ndiseases [ 10]. Nutritional de\ufb01cits can be involved in molecular and cellular dysfunction,\nwhich trigger oxidative stress and in\ufb02ammation, and can impact neuronal death, synapse\nand myelin formation, neurotransmitter metabolism, cell differentiation, plasticity, astro-\ncytes, and axonal and dendritic growth. Overall, these events culminate in motor de\ufb01cit\nand learning dif\ufb01culties caused by delayed development of cognitive and motor skills [ 2].\nConsequently, introducing important bioactive compounds early in development could\nbe a determining factor in facilitating optimal neural plasticity during brain development\nand improving clinical outcomes [ 2]. Such compounds could in\ufb02uence the development\nand function of the brain and be involved in the fetal\u2013neonatal disturbances predisposing\nto neurological delay or mental syndromes including autism spectrum disorder (ASD),\nattention-de\ufb01cit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy, anxiety, depression, cogni-\ntive dysfunction, visual impairment, motor de\ufb01cits, and neural tube defects, such as spina\nbi\ufb01da or anencephaly [ 11,12]. In recent years, it has been discovered that several epigenetic\nenzymes active during embryonic development require the presence of cofactors such\nas vitamins and polyphenols for their activity. Moreover, given the increasing incidence\nof neurodegenerative disorders, it is imperative to achieve signi\ufb01cant advancements in\nthe treatment of neurodegeneration by adopting different approaches. This includes the\nidenti\ufb01cation of nutrients that play an important role in either contributing to or being\nessential for the reduction of neurodegenerative disorder development.\nOne promising avenue involves investigating the potential of natural sources, such\nas the Manilkara zapota fruit, also known as \u201cchicozapote\u201d. This fruit is rich in bioactive\ncompounds with a wide range of biological functions, such as antioxidant, antidiabetic,\nantimicrobial, anti-in\ufb02ammatory, and cytotoxic agents. The bene\ufb01cial properties of this\nfruit help prevent chronic and degenerative diseases, including cancer and diabetes, as well\nas neurological, infectious, and cardiovascular diseases.

Micronutrients of Manilkara Zapota: As Essential as Complex \nManilkara Zapota fruit is a rich source of micronutrients such as minerals and \nvitamins, including vitamin A, B complex, C, folate, niacin, and pantothenic acid [13]. The mineral content of 100 g of Manilkara Zapota fruit has been analyzed, and consists of 193 \nm g  o f  p o t a s s i u m ,  2 1  m g  o f  c a l c i u m ,  1 2  mg of magnesium, and same amount for \nphosphorus. Manilkara Zapota phytochemica l compounds are princi pally polyphenols, \n\ufb02avonoids, and tannins [14], which consist of ellagitannins and gallot annins [15] (Figure \n1). The nutritional value of 100 g of Manilkara Zapota fruit consists of 83 calories, 5.3 g total dietary \ufb01ber, 0.4 g protein, 1.1 g fat, and 20 g carbohydrates. Terpenes, alkaloids, \nsaponins, steroids, and glycosides are also pr esent [16]. The great ca lorie value is because \nof its rich carbohydrate level [17].

Micronutrients of Manilkara zapota : As Essential as Complex\nManilkara zapota fruit is a rich source of micronutrients such as minerals and vitamins,\nincluding vitamin A, B complex, C, folate, niacin, and pantothenic acid [ 13]. The mineral\ncontent of 100 g of Manilkara zapota fruit has been analyzed, and consists of 193 mg of\npotassium, 21 mg of calcium, 12 mg of magnesium, and same amount for phosphorus.\nManilkara zapota phytochemical compounds are principally polyphenols, flavonoids, and tan-\nnins [ 14], which consist of ellagitannins and gallotannins [ 15] (Figure 1). The nutritional value\nof 100 g of Manilkara zapota fruit consists of 83 calories, 5.3 g total dietary fiber, 0.4 g protein,\n1.1 g fat, and 20 g carbohydrates. Terpenes, alkaloids, saponins, steroids, and glycosides are also\npresent [ 16]. The great calorie value is because of its rich carbohydrate level [ 17].Manilkara zapota\ncontains nearly 24 polyphenolic antioxidant compounds comprising methyl chlorogenate, myric-\nitrin, (+)-catechin, ( \u0000)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin, kaempferol, and dihydromyricetin [ 18,19]\nMethyl-4- O-galloylcholorogenate and 4- O-galloylchlorogenic acid have high antioxidant capac-\nity [20].Manilkara zapota has a total phenolic content (TPC) of 99.00 \u000612.30 mg of gallic acid\nequivalent (GAE)/(100 g) in fresh pulp [ 21], whereas TPC and total flavonoid content (TFC) in\nthe peel is 1151.40 \u000632.3 GAE/(100 g) and 564.50 \u000630.50 quercetin equivalent (QE)/(100 g),\nrespectively [ 22]. Therefore, Manilkara zapota is an excellent source of antioxidants. Us-\ning the 2,20-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay , it has been re-\nported that chicozapote fruit has an ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) of\n3396\u0006387.9 mg/kg [ 23]. According to the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay , the\nelements with the highest degree of antioxidant capacity isolated from methanolic fruit extract\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 4 of 22\nwere methyl-4- O-galloylchrologenate and 4- O-galloylchlorogenic acid [ 24]. Fresh pulp extract\nshowed a DPPH potential that was more robust than dried fruit, implying that the drying\nprocedure can influence antioxidant potential [ 25]. The shelf life of the fruits at 12\u201316\u000eC is\nreported to be 3 weeks at 85\u201390% relative humidity [26].\nVarious food products from Manilkara zapota such as jam, gelatins, chutney, dehydrated\nslices, candy, syrup, and mixed Manilkara zapota juices can be created to manage the\nperishability and preserve the wealth of its bioactive compounds [27].\n3. Bioactive Compounds De\ufb01ciency: Still Lacking the Crucial Knowledges\nBioactive compound de\ufb01ciency may affect the maternal immune response and\nmetabolic decompensation, which are essential factors responsible for epigenetic dys-\nregulation [ 28]. In cooperation, the maternal immune response and epigenetic mechanism\ncontrol ontogenesis and neurodevelopment. Maternal immune activation affects the remod-\neling of some chromosomal areas, transforming gene expression in the brain of offspring\nand generating changes with long-term effects [ 28]. Maternal metabolic imbalance also\ntriggers strong cellular alterations, with variations at the molecular level. Supplementation\nof biologically active compounds such as polyphenolic substances, vitamins, and minerals\ncan in\ufb02uence molecular/cellular processes, reducing oxidative stress, epigenetic modi\ufb01ca-\ntions, and alterations in lysosomal activity modulating gene expression or protein content,\nwhich preserves neurodevelopment [ 29]. In the same way as developmental neurogenesis,\nadult neurogenesis is controlled by extrinsic and intrinsic in\ufb02uences such as micronutrients\nin\ufb02uencing epigenetic phenomena [ 30]. In adults, micronutrient shortage can promote sev-\neral neurological illnesses such as depression, confusion, dementia, optic neuropathy, and\nnumbness and tingling in limbs [ 31]. Additionally, bioactive compound de\ufb01ciency is linked\nwith cognitive disorders. Although not fully con\ufb01rmed, some researchers assume that\nbioactive compound de\ufb01ciency can constitute an opportunity for the development of sev-\neral neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy,\nand subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord and peripheral neuropathy [31].\n4. Bioactive Compounds Are Valuable in Epigenetic Machinery\nBioactive compounds regulate the epigenetic remodeling of fetal genes. Their bene-\n\ufb01cial effects are evident from the implant, affecting placental development and nutrient\ntransfer [ 32]. Bioactive compounds control the biological functions that in\ufb02uence neu-\nrodevelopment modifying DNA methylation con\ufb01gurations [ 33]. DNA methylation is a\nreversible and active process mainly responsible for long-lasting gene silencing. Further-\nmore, DNA methylation allows the gene expression regulation, affecting various biological\nfunctions comprising embryonic growth, genomic imprinting, and aging. DNA methylation\ntakes place when a methyl group is positioned on the cytosine of a phosphodiester-bonded\ncytosine\u2013guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sequence. The covalent addition of a methyl group\nfrom S-adenosyl- L-methionine (SAM), to the C-5 position of cytosine bases occurs via the\naction of a group of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs) [ 34]. SAM is produced by\none-carbon metabolism, including the folate and methionine cycles, embracing the transfor-\nmation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is catalyzed\nby methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). In the context of DNA methylation,\nDNMTs function as \u201cwriters\u201d, whereas methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MECPs),\nwhich recognize methylated CpGs, function as \u201creaders\u201d [ 35]. Some bioactive compounds\nofManilkara zapota , such as folate, choline, betaine, methionine, and vitamin B 6, participate\nin one-carbon metabolism, contributing to SAM production, and are linked with DNA\nmethylation (Figure 2) [ 36]. Other compounds, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)\nand quercetin, are potent inhibitors of DNMTs. They act by binding the active site of the\nenzymes and, thus, reducing DNA methylation [37].\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 5 of 22\nNutrients 2024 , 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 23 \n \n methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MECPs), which recognize methylated CpGs, \nfunction as \u201creaders\u201d [35].

Its metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), is \nrequired in various processes in di \ufb00erent tissues. RA is crucial for brain and neural system \ndevelopment starting from the embryonic stage [38]. In neurons, RA regulates \ndi\ufb00erentiation, tissue formation, and synaptic pl asticity through its binding with retinoic \nacid receptors (RARs), sited in the promoter regions of RA-responsive genes, and a \ufb00ecting \nthe binding of other transcription factors [39]. RA molecular signaling pathways involved \nin neuronal di \ufb00erentiation are intricate. In particular, through the homeobox  (Hox ) gene \nclusters control several developmentally important genes [40]. Following RA stimuli, \nheterodimers of RAR \u03b3 and retinoid X receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1) recognize and bind RA-\nresponsive DNA elements (RAREs), thereby a \ufb00ecting epigenetic variations on histones, \ngenerating heritable alterations in chromati n responsiveness (Figur e 3) [41].

Role of Vitamin A in Brain Epigenetic Phenomena\nVitamin A is transported in the blood as retinol. Its metabolite, retinoic acid (RA),\nis required in various processes in different tissues. RA is crucial for brain and neural\nsystem development starting from the embryonic stage [ 38]. In neurons, RA regulates\ndifferentiation, tissue formation, and synaptic plasticity through its binding with retinoic\nacid receptors (RARs), sited in the promoter regions of RA-responsive genes, and affecting\nthe binding of other transcription factors [ 39]. RA molecular signaling pathways involved\nin neuronal differentiation are intricate. In particular, through the homeobox ( Hox) gene\nclusters control several developmentally important genes [ 40]. Following RA stimuli, het-\nerodimers of RAR \rand retinoid X receptor \u000b(RXR \u000b) recognize and bind RA-responsive\nDNA elements (RAREs), thereby affecting epigenetic variations on histones, generating\nheritable alterations in chromatin responsiveness (Figure 3) [ 41]. Vitamin A de\ufb01ciency\n(VAD) is a public health concern, especially in some developing countries. VAD is found in\nabout 19 million pregnant women and 190 million children worldwide [ 42]. During the\nembryo or postnatal period, VAD generates disorders of the RA signaling pathway. VAD-\nrelated genetic and molecular defects linked with low serum levels of RA, beta-carotene,\nand retinal dehydrogenase 1 have been found in children with ASD [ 43]. During pregnancy,\nlow VA serum levels in ADS children are often accompanied by multivitamin de\ufb01ciency\nand by atypical eating patterns such as pickiness, food refusal, and diet restriction, which\nmay further exacerbate nutritional de\ufb01ciencies [ 44]. Stem cell treatment with RA modu-\nlates many enzymes that modify the histones engaged in the transcriptional activation\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 6 of 22\nof certain genes. In particular RA, by binding to the RARs, modi\ufb01es connections of the\nRARs with proteins belonging to the transcription complex on numerous genes in stem\ncells. Some of these elements of the transcriptional complex insert or remove epigenetic\nmarks on histones, modifying the chromatin structure and inducing the exodus from the\nself-renewing pluripotent stem cell condition [ 45]. It has been found that crucial gene\nexpression modi\ufb01cations, facilitated by miRNAs, support the regulation of embryonic stem\ncell (ESC) RA-associated differentiation [ 45]. It has been suggested that histone demethy-\nlases expedite DNA demethylation in the promoter region of miR-219, thus promoting\nmiR-219 expression and neural differentiation. High expression levels of miRNA-219\nmay be critical during the early stage of RA-induced neural directional mESC differentia-\ntion [ 46]. During neural differentiation, Foxj3 and Zbtb18, which are two target genes of\nmiR-219, are known to be responsible for inducing oligodendrocyte differentiation and\nin part rescuing oligodendrocyte differentiation failure produced by total miRNA defeat.\nHowever, Olig1 and Olig2 are also crucial components in the neural differentiation of ESCs.\nOlig1 /2-knockdown ESCs, cultured in the presence of RA or transfected with miR-219\nmimic, were unable to differentiate into neural cells.

Therefore, SIRT1 is important, starting from the early phases of neuronal\ndifferentiation. SIRT1 behaves as a co-repressor of nucleolar RAR, and its shortage in-\ncreases the acetylation condition of cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABPII),\nstimulating differentiation of murine cells ESC through RA signaling [ 48].

It has different functions in the\nhuman hippocampus, as demonstrated by the \ufb01nding that several genes mediating retinol\ntransport, ATRA synthesis, and ATRA metabolism are compromised in hippocampal tissue\nfrom post-mortem AD brains [ 51]. Activation of NFKB1 and NFKB2 is linked to neuroin-\n\ufb02ammation following oxidative stress. Interference between Nrf2- and RAR-mediated\nsignaling reduction by the action of VA has been reported, suggesting that VA can act as an\nantioxidant. ATRA de\ufb01ciency can be related to age-dependent epigenetic silencing [ 52]. It\nhas been found that an enhanced expression of HDACs and abnormal epigenetic silencing\ninduces the downregulation of RAR- and Nrf2-dependent genes in AD. Therefore, VA\nsupplementation inhibiting HDAC inhibition could avoid AD (Figure 3) [53].\n6. Role of Vitamin B Complex in Brain Epigenetic Phenomena\nDuring pregnancy, exposure to water-soluble complex B vitamins in\ufb02uences the epige-\nnetic signature in neurodevelopment. These effects are linked with varied gene expressions\nassociated to brain development, axon guidance, and oxidative stress in the hypothalamus\nof newborns. Complex B vitamins comprising B2 and B3 exert anti-in\ufb02ammatory effects,\nmodulating genes such as NF- \u0014B activation, IL1B, IL6, IL10, iNOS, COX2, NF \u0014B, GSK-3 \f,\nTNF, APP , and several miRNAs stimulated by diacetyl benzene (DAB) in human neuroblas-\ntoma SH-SY5Y cells [ 54]. DAB is a molecule that passes through the blood\u2013brain barrier\n(BBB), producing neuroin\ufb02ammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cognitive de\ufb01ciency\n(Figure 3).\n6.1. Vitamin B2\nVitamin B2 or ribo\ufb02avin reduces cognitive impairment via antioxidative stress and\nanti-in\ufb02ammation properties. This vitamin is engaged in the modi\ufb01cation of epigenetic\nsignatures. Vitamin B2 de\ufb01ciency generates modi\ufb01cations in the methylation process.\nVitamin B2 facilitates the one-carbon group metabolism essential for histone function\nand the S-adenosylmethionine reaction [ 55]. Vitamin B2 controls histone methylation by\ninducing lysine-speci\ufb01c demethylase 1 (LSD1), which causes deletion of methyl groups\nfrom the H3 element of histone (Figure 2). This epigenetic effect is facilitated by the action\nof LSD1 via redox reactions. Oxygen molecules lead to the oxidation of FADH2 into FAD.\nLSD1, removing mono and dimethyl groups by oxidative separation, reduces \ufb02avin in\n1,5-dihydro \ufb02avin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) [56].\n6.2. Vitamin B3\nVitamin B3 or niacin plays an important role in the functioning of the nervous system,\nand is involved in cell differentiation and apoptosis. Vitamin B3 promotes numerous\ncellular pathways, such as cell signaling, redox reactions, activation of nucleotide syntheses,\nand folate-dependent enzymes [57], and facilitates transcriptional activity, recombination,\nDNA repair, and genome stability [ 58]. Vitamin B3 de\ufb01ciency leads to DNA fragility and\ndamage [ 57]. Therefore, niacin supplementation mitigates genomic instability [ 59]. Vita-\nmin B3 is deemed as a cofactor of NAD+-dependent enzymes, including PARPs, SIRTs,\nand ADP-ribosyl transferase. Both calorie control and oxidative stress impact the action\nof these enzymes by varying the NAD+/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide +hydrogen\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 8 of 22\n(NADH) ratio [ 60]. SIRTs are NAD+-dependent enzymes involved in deacetylation and\nADP-ribosyltransferase activities required by transcription factors, co-regulation factors,\nhistones, and enzymatic reactions. The SIRT family includes SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7. They\npreserve genome integrity, supporting DNA repair and genome con\ufb01guration, whereas\nSIRT2 contributes to cell cycle regulation [ 61]. SIRT1 function is regulated by nicotinamide\nadenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is consequently sensitive to the redox condition and\ncellular metabolism. SIRT1 activation has been shown to be related to a shift into the\nastroglial lineage in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) [ 62]. A reduction in NAD levels may\nbe associated with reduced SIRT1 activation in promoting neuron differentiation. In addi-\ntion, Sirt1-de\ufb01cient mice display severe neural failings such as interrupted neuroretinal\nmorphogenesis and exencephaly [ 63]. SIRTs cooperate with PGC1- \u000band PPAR \ras key\ntranscription factors (Figure 3). The activities attributed to PARPs include poly ADP ribose\nsequence generation [ 64], protection against chronic genotoxic stress, protection of chromo-\nsome endpoints to preserve genome integrity, and telomerase regulation. SIRT proteins\ncontrol epigenetic pathways modulating histone acetylation and chromatin-associated\nenzyme activities.\n6.3. Vitamin B6\nVitamin B6 is one of the critical factors for homocysteine (Hct) metabolism. Hct is\nan important amino acid available from a daily diet. It is produced in the metabolism\nof methionine. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHct) is triggered by several factors, such as\ngenetic de\ufb01cits, and vitamin B6 and folic acid de\ufb01ciency. A recessively inherited defect\nproducing a de\ufb01ciency of the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)\nis the origin of one form of hyperhomocysteinemia. Severe MTHFR de\ufb01ciency generates\nneurological manifestations, in particular neurodevelopment abnormalities and evolution\nof neuropsychiatric disorders such as ASD, schizophrenia, and epileptic seizures. Taking\ninto account the important role of vitamin B6 as a cofactor of enzymes involved in SAM\ngeneration, its de\ufb01ciency impacts the epigenetic con\ufb01guration of the genome via the\nmethylation pathway [ 65] (Figure 3). In addition to DNA hypomethylation, vitamin B6\nde\ufb01ciency, due to decreased levels of thymidine in the DNA, causes increased chromosomal\nbreakdown and impairment of DNA excision repair [ 66]. This evidence indicates that\nmethyl donor availability can in\ufb02uence epigenetic modi\ufb01cations and oligodendrocyte\ndifferentiation [67].\n6.4. Vitamin B9\nFolate is involved in the one-carbon group\u2019s metabolism and methionine synthesis [ 68].\nIts primary function lies in cell division activities, such as synthesis, expression, and DNA re-\npair [ 69]. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate ( N-5,10 mTHF) is the metabolically active form of folate\nformed by the transformation of serine into glycine in the course of the insertion of a methylene\ngroup from tetrahydrofolate. Acting as a crucial coenzyme, N-5,10 mTHF governs the synthe-\nsis of DNA precursors, serving as a rate-limiting factor [ 57]. Additionally , it supplies methyl\ndonors for all methyltransferase enzymes such as hydroxy indole- O-methyltransferase, catechol-\nO-methyltransferase, and phenylethanolamine- N-methyltransferase [ 69]. The bioactive metabolite\n5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF , L-methylfolate) stabilizes the synthesis of the monoamine neu-\nrotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin via the tetrahydrobiopterin pathway [ 70].\nFolate is involved in chromatin remodeling, in micro-RNAs, and post-translational modification\nof histone proteins [ 71]. The methylation of CpG-dinucleotides is essential in the regulation of\ntranscription pathways and cell division, growth, and differentiation [72].\nFolate de\ufb01ciency causes DNA hypomethylation, in all regions of DNA breakage\nand inactivated repair [ 73], and in speci\ufb01c genes involved in genomic stability affecting\nthe occurrence of severe neurological abnormalities such as tumors and cerebrovascular\ndiseases [ 74]. In the course of brain development, folate is required for neural stem cell\n(NSC) proliferation and differentiation. Studies on primary embryonic cells isolated from\nrat fetuses indicate that maternal folic acid de\ufb01ciency reduces cell proliferation, impairs\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 9 of 22\nmitosis, and increases apoptosis [ 75]. Notably, folate de\ufb01ciency is not only the main cause\nof neural tube defects but it has also been found in several congenital defects including\ncognitive dysfunction and ASD, and also in dementia and AD [ 76]. Experimental evidence\nsuggests that folate de\ufb01ciency can induce neuronal immaturity via DNA methylation.\nPrimary mouse NSCs/NPCs in a low-folate medium exhibited reduced SAM levels and\nDNA hypomethylation in the CpG islands within the promoters of genes crucial for\nneuronal functions, including Neurog1 ,Eomes , and Neurod1 [77]. Another study showed that,\nduring gestation, folic acid de\ufb01ciency reduces NSC proliferation and increases apoptosis\nin the fetal brain [ 78]. Maternal folic acid de\ufb01ciency further damages NSC differentiation\nand induces apoptosis of neurons in the fetal brain via ERK1/2 gene pathways [ 79]. During\npregnancy and lactation, folic acid de\ufb01ciency induced plasma peptide YY and POMC gene\nexpression in rat offspring, leading to anomalous leptin, ghrelin, and insulin secretions,\naffecting hypothalamic neurodevelopment [ 80]. Moreover, post-weaning dietary folic\nacid content affects hypothalamic neurodevelopment through epigenetic mechanisms\nattenuating the decrease in Pomc mRNA expression and gene POMC promoter DNA\nmethylation levels [ 77] (Figure 3). A large amount of folic acid (10 times more than\nrecommended) in the offspring diet changes 5-Htr2a ,5-Htr2c, and Pomc hypothalamic gene\nexpression [77].\nThis suggests that neurodevelopment plasticity of hypothalamic neuro-circuits in the\ncourse of the pre- and postnatal stages is susceptible to changes in the content of vitamins\nin the diet.\n7. Vitamin C in Brain Epigenetic Phenomena\nVitamin C is an important bioactive molecule in humans. Vitamin C is a cofactor\nof the demethylation of histone and DNA breakdown enzymes essential in the setting\nof epigenetic phenomena. Vitamin C in DNAm operates through the activation of TET\nhydroxylase enzymes [ 81]. The maximum quantity of vitamin C has been observed in\nthe brain, mainly in the course of embryonic development [ 82]. Vitamin C de\ufb01ciency\ncauses disorders of epigenetic patterns and incidence of neurodegenerative disorders [ 82].\nVitamin C enhances upregulation of FOXA2 and LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha\n(LMX1A) markers in the course of differentiation of neurons by increasing expression of the\nassociated genes, such as nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (NURR1), pituitary homeobox 3\n(PITX3), and neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) [ 83], and recovers defects in neurons due to degenerative\nbrain diseases [ 82]. Without a doubt, vitamin C induces mRNA expression of these genes\nduring the transcription phase. Vitamin C is also a cofactor of Fe2+-oxoglutarate-dependent\ndioxygenase enzymes (ten\u2013eleven-translocation) and jumonji (JmjC)-domain-containing\nenzymes in the demethylation of lysine residues of histone proteins [ 84]. In adequate\ndoses, vitamin C can preserve the action of histone H3 acetylation and Lys4 methylation\n(H3K4me3) [ 85] (Figure 3). A substantial correlation has been found between upregulation\nof TET enzymes and high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in CpG sites of the promoter\nregion [ 83]. It has been shown that TET1 and TET2 activities are displayed in DNAm\npatterns and enhance reprogramming capability [ 86]. In addition, vitamin C activates\nthe AlkB family protein, which mediates nucleic acid repair [ 86]. In particular, AlkB\nand its mammalian homologs, ABH2 and ABH3, facilitate DNA repair by oxidation of\n3-methylcytosine and 1-methyladenine [87].\n8. The Neuroprotective Effects of Polyphenols: A Story T old by Neuroinflammatory Disorders\nPolyphenols are heterogeneous compounds with strong antioxidant properties broadly\ndistributed in plants in the form of glycosides or aglycones. Chemically, they are molecules\ntypi\ufb01ed by at least two phenol rings and one or more hydroxyl substituents. Polyphenols\ncan be distinguished into many subclasses depending on the amount of phenolic units\ncontained in their molecular organization. For the substituent groups and/or the nature of\nbond between phenolic rings, they can be classi\ufb01ed into \ufb02avonoids and non-\ufb02avonoids.\nThe principal subclasses of polyphenols embrace phenolic acids, coumarins, stilbenes,\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 10 of 22\n\ufb02avonoids, tannins, and lignans [ 88]. It has been reported that polyphenol supplementation\nduring pregnancy and breastfeeding may moderate brain injury in embryonic, fetal, and\nneonatal subjects, as well as offspring, emphasizing the role of these organic substances in\ncontrolling adaptative responses involving phenotypical plasticity. The brain is predisposed\nto oxidative stress because of its elevated oxygen intake, low antioxidant aptitude, and\nhigh levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids which are susceptible to lipid peroxidation [89].\nPolyphenols restrain in\ufb02ammation and oxidative stress that origin permanent damages\nin movement, cognitive, and behavioral functions, such as cerebral palsy, hydrocephaly,\nblindness, and deafness [90].\nOne of the most signi\ufb01cant roles of phenols is their capacity to prevent free radi-\ncal formation. They operate as metal chelators, free-radical scavengers, reducing agents,\nenzyme regulators of various proteins, and transcriptional factors [ 91]. The antioxidant\npropriety of these molecules confers neuroprotective effects, thus delaying the onset or\ndecreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, Parkinson\u2019s (PD), dementia\nwith Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy [ 92]. Their bioactivity is also attributed to\ntheir capacity to inhibit the GABA receptor [ 93], prevent mitochondrial dysfunction [ 94],\nand control neuronal signaling pathways essential for monitoring neuronal resistance to\nneurotoxic oxidants, in\ufb02ammatory mediators, and chelation of transition metal ions [ 94].\nThe placenta, regulating the transition of nutrients between maternal and fetal blood, rep-\nresents a symbiosis point between the mother and the fetus. The placenta is the \ufb01rst fetal\nline of defense in the course of pregnancy. Furthermore, when the organism is particularly\nexposed to external stimuli, physiological barriers such as the BBB, which controls selective\npermeability, are crucial for healthy neurodevelopment. The BBB begins to be operational\naround the eighth week of gestation, while, at the twelfth week, tight junction proteins are\nexpressed [ 95]. The tight junctions providing semi-permeability act as an obstacle to the\nfree entrance of molecules from the early stages of brain development [ 95]. Polyphenols,\nlike some \ufb02avanones, can pass through the BBB and directly protect neurons because\nof their antioxidant properties and their direct effects on enzymes, proteins, receptors,\nand signaling pathways. Epigenetic modi\ufb01cations could activate genes related to the\nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. Histone\nand DNA methyltransferase changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a\nstrategic actor in epigenetic regulation. The remarkable ef\ufb01ciency of polyphenols is related\nto a number of signaling pathways involving AMPK, nuclear factor kappa B (NF- \u0014B), and\nPI3K. For instance, lack of oxygen is frequently linked with reduced AMPK expression,\nwhich may be induced by polyphenol supplementation, which increases levels of the an-\ntioxidant system\u2019s SOD, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase, and decreases the expression\nof in\ufb02ammatory mediators through NF- \u0014B suppression [96]. Treatment with polyphenols\nduring pregnancy [ 97] and lactation [ 98] improves locomotor activity, cognitive function,\nand anxiety behavior in offspring exposed to brain damage. Moreover, they can reduce\nfree radical formation and neuroin\ufb02ammation in the hippocampus [ 99], and ameliorate\nremyelination of motor neurons [ 100]. The neuroprotective activity exerted by polyphe-\nnols depends as well as on their antioxidant and anti-in\ufb02ammatory ability [ 101], and on\ntheir antimutagenic and antimicrobial activity in the activation of enzymes responsible\nfor antioxidant systems and xenobiotic detoxi\ufb01cation [ 102]. In\ufb02ammation is linked with\nincreased DNA methylation levels, [ 103], which disturb the expression of genes engaged in\nthe crosstalk between in\ufb02ammatory pathways and neural activity, \ufb01nally providing suscep-\ntibility to psychopathologies, including depression and anxiety [ 104]. Oxidative stress has\na double effect: on the one hand, it deactivates histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and, at the\nsame time, it activates the DNA methylating enzyme, DNMT1 [ 105]. Polyphenols in\ufb02u-\nence epigenetic alterations such as chromatin remodeling through modulation of histone\ndeacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) actions, which, therefore, can in-\nvert atypical gene expression [ 105]. Polyphenols trigger SIRT1 to deacetylate high-mobility\ngroup box-1 (HMGB1) thus reducing its translocation and preventing the in\ufb02ammatory\nresponse induced by the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway [ 106]. In addition,\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 11 of 22\npolyphenols protecting SIRT1 against oxidative stress effects prevent neurodegeneration\nand cognitive impairment [ 107]. Polyphenol antioxidant properties are dependent on the\ninhibition of NO and PGE2 release, and the consequent activation of NADPH oxidase and\nprevention of ROS formation in the brain. Furthermore, interacting with and activating the\nreceptor kinases ERK1/2, JNK, and p38, they interfere the Keap1/Nrf2 complex and induce\nthe translocation of nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2)-related transcription factors to the nucleus,\nwhere, by binding to receptors rich in adenylate and uridylate (ARE), they promote the\naction of antioxidant proteins and enzymes [ 108]. Epigenetic modi\ufb01cations could activate\ngenes linked to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling\npathway. It has been shown that, following insults, polyphenols restored the impaired\nP13K/Akt pathway, the dimensions of cerebral infarct and apoptosis interrupting caspase-3\nactivation, together with a decline in Bcl-Xl and Bcl-2 expression and proteolytic processing\nof post-lesion substrates [109,110] (Figure 4).\nNutrients 2024 , 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 23 \n \n ameliorate remyelination of motor neurons [100]. The neuroprotective activity exerted by \npolyphenols depends as well as on their antioxidant and anti-in \ufb02ammatory ability [101], \nand on their antimutagenic and antimicrobial ac tivity in the activation of enzymes respon-\nsible for antioxidant syst ems and xenobiotic detoxi \ufb01cation [102]. In \ufb02ammation is linked \nwith increased DNA methylation levels, [103], which disturb the expression of genes en-\ngaged in the crosstalk between in \ufb02ammatory pathways and neural activity, \ufb01nally provid-\ning susceptibility to psychopathologies, including depression and anxiety [104]. Oxidative \nstress has a double e \ufb00ect: on the one hand, it deactiva tes histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), \nand, at the same time, it activates the DNA methylating enzyme, DNMT1 [105]. Polyphe-\nnols in \ufb02uence epigenetic alterations such as chromatin remodeling through modulation \nof histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA me thyltransferase (DNMT) actions, which, \ntherefore, can invert atypical gene expression  [105]. Polyphenols trigger SIRT1 to deacety-\nlate high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) thus reducing its translocation and preventing \nthe in \ufb02ammatory response induced by the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway \n[106]. In addition, polyphenols protecting SIRT1 against oxidative stress e \ufb00ects prevent \nneurodegeneration and cognitive impairment [107]. Polyphenol antioxidant properties \nare dependent on the inhibition of NO and PG E2 release, and the consequent activation \nof NADPH oxidase and prevention of ROS formation in the brain. Furthermore, interact-\ning with and activating the receptor kinase s ERK1/2, JNK, and p38, they interfere the \nKeap1/Nrf2 complex and induce the translocation of nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2)-related tran-\nscription factors to the nucleus, where, by bi nding to receptors rich in adenylate and uri-\ndylate (ARE), they promote the action of an tioxidant proteins and enzymes [108].

The antioxidant action of EGCG has\nbeen observed in neuroprotective prenatal treatments in the course of intrauterine growth\nrestriction (IUGR) [ 111], which is a common disease throughout development. IUGR is des-\nignated as a substantial decrease in the rate of fetal development, principally consequential\nto placental insuf\ufb01ciency [ 111]. This occurrence entails a fetal development in conditions\nof chronic hypoxia, producing lesions of the white substance as a result of myelination\ndefects and an important decrease in oligodendrogenesis [ 111]. In the long term, IUGR can\nresult in serious outcomes of neurodevelopment such as neurocognitive disorders, learning\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 12 of 22\ndif\ufb01culties, attention de\ufb01cit disorder or hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorder [ 111].\nEGCG exerts neuroprotective properties by recovering cerebral functions and reducing\nROS generation. In the middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model of cerebral I/R injury,\nit has been found that EGCG promotes NRF2 translocation into the nucleus and triggers\nthe NRF2/ARE pathway and its downstream target genes, such as the glutamate\u2013cysteine\nligase modulatory subunit and glutamate\u2013cysteine ligase regulatory subunit [ 112]. Among\nits properties, EGCG regulates several enzymes by modulating their kinase activity [ 113].\nEGCG, in some measure, preserves the hippocampus from the effects of overexpression\nof dual speci\ufb01city tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), which is\nengaged in neurodevelopment. EGCG inhibition of DYRK1A kinase activity causes sta-\nbilization of this gene, which is crucial for Down syndrome pathology [ 114]. In addition,\nDYRK1A is engaged in epigenetic regulation, suggesting that EGCG could both directly\nand indirectly control the epigenetic state. This association is very vigorous since, like the\nEGCG effect, an enriched milieus repairs defects in Down syndrome, stabilizes DYRK1A\nlevels, and interferes at various levels with epigenetic mechanisms [ 115]. EGCG affects the\nchromatin state and prevents both DNA methyltransferases [ 116], HAT [ 117], and class\nI histone deacetylases (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 8) [ 118]. It in\ufb02uences the anti-NF-kB transacti-\nvation in a wide array of human chronic in\ufb02ammation diseases. EGCG reduces ac-RelA\n(K310) acetylation by preventing the activity of HAT enzymes, p300, and CPB [ 117]. This\nhypoacetylation of p65 leads to the downregulation of NF-kB function by diverse in\ufb02am-\nmatory signals. EGCG inhibition of HAT can result in the failure of histone acetylation in\nHDAC promoter, preventing HDAC expression, thus contributing to its neuroprotective\neffect. EGCG decreases H327me3 and H2AK119 ubiquitination moderating polycomb\nprotein levels [ 119] and miRNA expression [ 120], and thus improves cognitive and neural\nplasticity phenotypes [114] (Figure 4).\n9. Phenolic Acids of Manilkara zapota Exerting Neuroprotective Functions\nThe most abundant phenolic compounds found in Manilkara zapota are gallic acid\n(GA) and protocatechuic acid, accompanied by chlorogenic, ferulic, caffeic, vanillic, and\ncoumaric acids [ 17]. Improvements in cognitive functions due to these phenolic com-\npounds have been observed in several neuropathological disorders, such as cerebral is-\nchemia [ 121\u2013123], LPS-induced neurological alterations [ 124], and scopolamine-induced\nneurotoxicity [ 125]. They share antioxidant, anti-in\ufb02ammatory, neuroprotective [ 126], and\nmemory-ameliorating properties [124].\n9.1. Gallic Acid Epigenetic Mechanisms\nGA is a 5,4,3-trihydroxybenzoic acid found copiously in free, conjugated (hydrolyz-\nable tannins), and esteri\ufb01ed forms [ 127]. GA prevents the nuclear translocation of p65 of\nNF-\u0014B caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, GA inhibits several histone acetyl-\ntransferases (HATs) [ 128], including HDAC and histone methyltransferase (HMT). GA\ncan regulate key signaling pathways implicated in in\ufb02ammatory responses such as the\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [ 129]. Evidence reported that GA inhibits p300-induced p65\nacetylation and p300/CBP-dependent HAT activities [130].\nGA displays a strong inhibitory role on DNMT1 activity , preventing Akt phosphorylation.\nIn addition, it reduces both the nuclear import and protein stability of DNMT1. DNMT1 is\nknown as an important enzyme working in the somatic inheritance of DNA methylation and\ntherefore is indispensable in epigenome preservation [ 131]. GA induces SIRT1 to protect cells\nagainst oxidative stress [ 132]. It has been proven that SIRT1 deacetylates lysine 310 of the\nRelA/p65 subunit of NF-kB, a critical subunit for the activation of proinflammatory gene tran-\nscription that generates the inflammatory response [ 133]. In the brain, inflammation is largely\nlinked to glia cells, which produce cytokines and influence synaptic plasticity in neurons [ 134].\nNF-\u0014B comprises the heterodimeric complex of p50/p52 and p65 proteins. In the cytoplasm,\nthe NF- \u0014B heterodimer links the inhibitory protein I \u0014B, inactivating the whole complex. ROS\nand other proinflammatory factors induce protein kinase that phosphorylates IkB, which\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 13 of 22\nreleases the p50/p65 complex. Then p50/p65 translocates to the nucleus where, by binding to\nspecific DNA promoter regions, it functions as a transcription factor [ 135]. In particular, p65 is\na subunit transcriptional activation domain of NF- \u0014B and is controlled by posttranslational\nchanges such as phosphorylation serines (276, 311, 529, and 536) and acetylation lysines (310,\n122, 123, 218, and 221) [ 136]. Neuroprotection is linked with variations in the acetylation state\nof NF- \u0014B/RelA. The acetylation of lysine 310 of the RelA/p65 NF- \u0014B subunit protracts NF- \u0014B\nactivation time and increases its efficiency , amplifying inflammation [ 137]. The SIRT1 deacety-\nlase enzyme can cooperate with the RelA/p65 protein complex NF- \u0014B, deacetylating lysine\n310 of the RelA/p65 NF-kB subunit to avoid transcription of proinflammatory genes [ 137]\n(Figure 5). It has been shown that GA, because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and\nanti-amyloidogenic effects, overcomes microglial-mediated neuroinflammation and reduces\ncytokine generation [ 138]. Moreover, the GA neuroprotective action has been demonstrated in\nexperimental models of traumatic brain injury attributable to enhancement in the antioxidant\nand anti-inflammatory functions [ 139]. In multiple sclerosis experimental animals, GA treat-\nments reduced the oxidative and inflammatory response and stimulated dendritic hyperplasia\nwith an intensification of dendritic spines [ 140]. Structural and functional variations in the neu-\nrons of lab animals with neurodegenerative diseases were restored after GA administration,\nand, as a result, neurochemical functions were reestablished [141].\nNutrients 2024 , 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 23 \n \n  \n \nFigure 5.

Flavonoids of Manilkara zapota Having Neuroprotective Functions\nFlavonoids present in Manilkara zapota include quercetin, apigenin, kaempferol, and\nmyricetin. It has been demonstrated that different \ufb02avonoids induce SIRT1-mediated NF- \u0014B\ninhibition also in the brain following oral dosing [ 144]. This effect in the brain is crucial, as it\nhas been shown that SIRT1 controls energy metabolism, dendrite formation, axonal growth,\nneuronal plasticity, and neuronal endurance against stress, and suppresses in\ufb02ammation\nby restraining NF- \u0014B [145]. This group exerts immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory, pro-apoptotic effects and prevents DNA damage [ 146]. Commonly, their\nmechanism of action occurs through the stimulation of NRF2 protein and of its target\ngenes HO1 ,SOD , and CAT , in\ufb02ammation regression, and apoptosis inhibition via Bax and\ncaspase-3. In high-fructose-feeding diet mice, apigenin prevents KEAP1/NRF2 binding,\nincreases the expression and nuclear translocation of NRF2 and its downstream targets\nHO-1 and NQO1 , and in the end avoids metabolic syndrome. The PI3K/Akt pathway\nef\ufb01ciently inhibits diabetic neuropathy evolution.

Myricitrin\nMyricitrin is a \ufb02avonoid that is located near the surface of the Manilkara zapota mem-\nbrane and thus exposed to incoming radicals and, therefore, can neutralize them before they\nreach a reactive site in the membrane [ 91]. Myricitrin is the most hydrophilic \ufb02avonoid and\nthe one with the highest ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation in phospholipid double-layer\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 15 of 22\nmembranes [ 91]. Renowned for its potent antioxidant properties, myricitrin actively curbs\nthe intracellular production of ROS, shielding against peroxide-induced toxicity (Figure 6).\nMyricitrin signi\ufb01cantly increases cell survival and restores the S phase of DNA synthesis.\nIts neuroprotective effectiveness is evident in its ability to safeguard against neuron\ndamage [ 149,150]. In experimental studies involving Wistar rats subjected to ethidium\nbromide-induced hippocampal damage, myricitrin treatment decreased damage and en-\nhanced the ability to preserve information and memories, spatial memory, balance, and\nanxiety [53].\n10.2. Quercetin\nQuercetin is an antioxidative and excellent neuroprotective compound, and is a promis-\ning candidate for ameliorating cognitive de\ufb01cits in neurodegenerative disorders [ 151]. It\nachieves this through several mechanisms: increasing the antioxidant defense system by\ninhibiting the ROS/NF- \u0014B/NLRP3 in\ufb02ammasome/IL-1 \fand IL-18 pathways [ 152], as\nwell as by upregulating the NRF2/NRF1 transcription pathway and the anti-in\ufb02ammatory\nmolecule IL-10 [153] (Figure 6).\nMirna-124 is one of the most represented miRNAs in the brain, and is important\nin regulating neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, maturation, and synapse formation.\nAlterations of miR-124 have been found in the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental\nand neuropsychiatric disorders [ 154]. Furthermore, quercetin inhibits p300/CBP [ 155], and\nhas shown neuroprotective properties in cellular and animal models of brain ischemia [ 156].\n11. Conclusions and Future Perspectives\nThe rich bioactive compounds found in Manilkara zapota fruits are a valuable health\nresource, containing methyl nutrients that can modulate gene and protein expression in\nboth the brain and peripheral tissues of offspring through epigenetic mechanisms, particu-\nlarly in maternal diets. Disruptions of neuroplasticity can negatively affect neurological\ndevelopment. Contact with toxic elements during development, such as chronic stress, and\nalcohol or drug trauma, can compromise neuroplasticity and disturb normal brain devel-\nopment. It has proven that a combination of micronutrients enriched with different types\nof polyphenols and vitamins can regulate the epigenetic state of important antioxidant,\nanti-in\ufb02ammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective target proteins. The neuroprotective\neffect and epigenetic activity exhibited by the mixture of these bioactive components em-\nphasize the synergistic relationships between these molecules during neurodevelopment,\nwhich allow the safeguarding of neonatal brain impairment and the reversal of sensory\nde\ufb01cits, both motor and cognitive, prompted by hypoxia\u2013ischemia.\nAlthough Manilkara zapota fruit is bene\ufb01cial to many, those suffering from certain\nconditions should consume it in moderation. In fact, subjects with latex allergies may\nreact to Manilkara zapota , as it contains some common allergenic compounds. Excessive\nconsumption of Manilkara zapota can cause gastrointestinal problems such as bloating or\ngas due to its \ufb01ber content, especially when taken in large quantities. It is advisable to\ngradually introduce Manilkara zapota into the diet to assess its tolerability, especially in\nchildren after weaning.\nTo date, as far as we know, there have been no comprehensive reviews addressing the\nrole of the Manilkara zapota fruit in neuro-evolutionary and neurogenic epigenetic mechanisms.\nTherefore, the insights discussed here could signi\ufb01cantly improve our understanding\nof the nutritional and pharmacological properties of this fruit when incorporated into a\ndiet. Future efforts should include epidemiological and clinical investigations to assess the\neffectiveness of Manilkara zapota bioactive compounds in promoting neurodevelopment and\nmaintaining neuronal health, particularly in regions where this fruit is widely produced\nand consumed.\nNutrients 2024 ,16, 2225 16 of 22\nAuthor Contributions: C.R.: literature research, writing\u2014original draft, revising, graphic design;\nM.S.V .: literature research, writing\u2014original draft, revising and editing; F.D.: literature research,\nrevising and editing; S.S.: literature research, \ufb01gure preparation; S.G.: revising and editing; A.C.B.:\nrevising and editing; L.M.: conceptualization, writing\u2014original draft, supervision.
