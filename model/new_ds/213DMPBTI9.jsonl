However, the\nbiologic mechanisms that regulate axonal plasticity under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion have not been fully investigated. Here,we investigated whether L-carnitine, an antioxidant agent, enhances axonal plasticity and oligodendrocyte expression, and\nexplored the signaling pathways that mediate axonal plasticity in a rat chronic hypoperfusion model. Adult male Wistar rats\nsubjected to ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries (LBCCA) were treated with or without L-carnitine. L-carnitine-treatedrats exhibited signi \ufb01cantly reduced escape latency in the Morris water maze task at 28 days after chronic hypoperfusion. Western\nblot analysis indicated that L-carnitine increased levels of phosphorylated high-molecular weight neuro \ufb01lament (pNFH), concurrent\nwith a reduction in phosphorylated phosphatase tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), and increasedphosphorylated Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) at 28 days after chronic hypoperfusion. L-carnitine reduced lipidperoxidation and oxidative DNA damage, and enhanced oligodendrocyte marker expression and myelin sheath thickness after\nchronic hypoperfusion. L-carnitine regulates the PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and enhances axonal plasticity while\nconcurrently ameliorating oxidative stress and increasing oligodendrocyte myelination of axons, thereby improving WMLs andcognitive impairment in a rat chronic hypoperfusion model.\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015) 35,382 \u2013391; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2014.210; published online 3 December 2014\nKeywords: axonal outgrowth; chronic hypoperfusion; L-carnitine; oxidative stress; stroke\nINTRODUCTION\nCerebral white matter constitutes 50% of human brain mass and\ncontains abundant axons and oligodendrocytes.\n1Cerebral white\nmatter is damaged by a variety of neurologic disorders including\nischemic stroke, and white-matter lesions (WMLs) have been\nassociated with cognitive impairment.2Oligodendrocytes are lipid\nrich and exhibit low levels of antioxidant enzymes, which reduce\ntheir ability to cope with the increased generation of reactive\noxygen species during ischemic insults.3Axons are vulnerable\nto ischemia, and are also damaged by axon \u2013oligodendro-\ncyte interactions after ischemia.4Permanent occlusion of both\ncommon carotid arteries can induce chronic cerebral hypoperfu-sion in experimental animals, which results in WMLs in the corpuscallosum.\n5\u20137Various pathogenic factors are implicated in WMLs,\nincluding oxidative stress, in \ufb02ammatory reactions, and endothelial\ninjuries.6\nL-carnitine therapy is required for children with an inborn error\nof metabolism as well as chronic debilitating diseases including\ncancer, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.8,9In such\nchronic diseases, L-carnitine has a pivotal role in suppressingin\ufb02ammatory reactions, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.9L-carnitinehas also been proven bene \ufb01cial in ischemic heart disease and\nperipheral artery disease.10,11Continuous supplementation with L-\ncarnitine increases carnitine content, stimulates pyruvateoxidation, and thereby remodels the myocardium and improvescardiac dysfunction.\n12However, little information is available on\nthe effect of L-carnitine on cerebral ischemia.13\u201315To date, the\neffect of L-carnitine on WMLs induced by chronic cerebral hypo-perfusion is essentially unknown.\nAxonal outgrowth and plasticity are critical processes during\nbrain repair after stroke injury, and related to improvements in\nneurologic de \ufb01cits after stroke.\n16,17Stroke induces axonal out-\ngrowth, and emerging data indicate that the phosphoinositide3-kinase/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3 \u03b2signaling pathway\nenhances axonal outgrowth after stroke.\n18To date, the mechan-\nisms that regulate axonal plasticity after chronic hypoperfusionhave not been extensively studied. In the present study, we used arat chronic hypoperfusion model to determine whether L-carnitineexerts a neuroprotective role in WMLs and enhances axonalplasticity, and investigated the signaling pathways that mediateaxonal plasticity.\n1Department of Neurology, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital, Chiba, Japan;2Department of Neurology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan;3Department\nof Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan and4Department of Cellular and Molecular Neuropathology, Juntendo University\nGraduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.

The Animal Care\nCommittee of Juntendo University approved all animal protocols used inthe present study, and efforts were made to minimize the number ofanimals used and their suffering. Adult male Wistar rats (9 to 11 weeks old)weighing 280 to 320 g were purchased from Charles River Institute(Kanagawa, Japan). Chronic cerebral hy poperfusion was induced by ligation of\nboth common carotid arteries (LBCCA), as described previously.\n4\u20136Rats\nwere anesthetized with 1.0% to 2.0% iso \ufb02urane in 30% O 2and 70% N 2O.\nThrough a midline incision, the bilateral common carotid arteries werecarefully separated from the cervical sympathetic and vagal nerves, andligatured permanently. During this procedure, the body temperature wasmaintained at 37.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C. Rats at baseline (before LBCCA) or 7, 14, 21, and28 days after LBCCA were reanesthetized with 1% iso \ufb02urane, 70% N\n2O:30%\nO2, and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\nfollowed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was dissected out immedia-tely, post \ufb01xed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours, and stored in 30%\nsucrose in 0.1 mol/L PBS. For immunohistochemistry, 20- \u03bcm-thick free-\n\ufb02oating coronal sections of rat brain were prepared for staining.\nDrug Administration and Classi \ufb01cation\nRats were randomly divided into the following groups: (1) L-carnitine\ngroup: post-LBCCA, rats were treated per os daily with 600 mg/kg (in 0.7 mL\nsaline) L-carnitine (Sigma Aldrich, Inc., St Louis, MO, USA) using an oralgavage tube, until euthanasia;19(2) vehicle group: rats received per os\nadministration of saline, volumes similar to the L-carnitine group, using a\ngavage tube; and (3) control sham-operated group: rats underwent the\nprotocol described for the vehicle group, but were spared LBCCA.\nMeasurement of Cerebral Blood Flow\nCerebral blood \ufb02ow (CBF) was measured at a left temporal window, using\nlaser Doppler \ufb02owmetry (Laser Tissue Blood Flow Meter FLO-C1; Omega\nW a v e ,I n c . ,T o k y o ,J a p a n ) .A \ufb02at rectangular sheet-shaped probe (7.5 mm in\nlength and 1.0 mm in depth) was positioned between the temporal muscle\nand the lateral aspect of the skull, according to a previously publishedmethod.20Craniotomy was not required and CBF was monitored continu-\nously in 3 to 5 minutes sessions before, immediately after, and 7, 14, 21, and\n28 days after LBCCA. Reproducibly recorded CBF velocities were obtained.\nWater Maze Task\nThe water maze task was performed to evaluate de \ufb01cits in learning and\nspatial memory induced by cerebral chronic hypoperfusion, using themethod described previously.6A circular transparent acrylic platform with\na radius of 20 cm was placed in a 150-cm diameter circular pool \ufb01lled with\nwater (20 cm depth) set at 22 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, with the top surface of the platform\npositioned 3 cm below the surface of the water. The water in the pool was\nmade opaque with milk so that the rats were unable to see the underwaterplatform. Rats were released facing a wall from a standard point, and thetime taken to escape to the platform was recorded as the escape latency.The rats performed \ufb01ve trials per day, with a constant intertrial interval of\n30 minutes, for 3 consecutive days before LBCCA. The escape latency was\nanalyzed before LBCCA and 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after LBCCA.\nRotarod Performance Test\nThe rotarod performance test was performed to assess motor dysfunction\ninduced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. After 3 consecutive days oftraining before the operation, rotarod performance was evaluated at 7, 14, 21,and 28 days after LBCCA. The speed was slowly increased from 10 to 40 r.p.m.\n(0.005 to 0.08 g) over a period of 4 minut es. The trial ended when the animal\nfalls off the rungs. The maximum duration on the device was recorded withthree rotarod measurements. Rotarod test data are presented as percentagesof the maximal duration, compared with the internal baseline control.\nImmunohistochemistry and Double Immuno \ufb02uorescence\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on brain sections, as previously\ndescribed.18After incubation in 0.3% H 2O2followed by 10% block ace in\n0.1 mol/L PBS, coronal sections of the corpus callosum were immuno-stained overnight at 4\u00b0C using a mouse monoclonal antibody against 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE, a marker of lipid peroxidation; dilution, 40:1;\nJapan Institute for the Control of Aging, Japan), a mouse monoclonal\nantibody against 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG, a marker of oxida-\ntive DNA damage; dilution 100:1; Japan Institute for the Control of Aging),\na rabbit polyclonal antibody against glutathione-S-transferase-pi (GST-pi, a\nmarker of oligodendrocytes; dilution, 1,000:1; Chemicon International, Inc.,\nTemecula, CA, USA), and ss-DNA (a marker of apoptotic cells; dilution,\n100:1; Dako Corporation, Carpentaria, CA, USA) staining. The sections were\nthen treated with secondary antibodies (dilution, 300:1; Vectastain; Vector\nLaboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Immunoreactivity was subsequentlyvisualized using the avidin-biotin complex method (Vectastain, Vector\nLaboratories) and developed with diaminobenzidine. For double immuno-\n\ufb02uorescence staining, mouse anti-SMI31 (a marker of phosphorylated high\nmolecular weight neuro \ufb01lament, pNFH; 1:100; Covance, Emeryville, CA,\nUSA), mouse anti-SMI32 (a marker of nonphosphorylated NFH, 1:100; Covance),\nand rat anti-myelin basic protein (MBP; 1:100; Millipore, Philadelphia, PA,\nUSA) were used. After washing with PBS three times, rat coronal sectionswere incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibodies listed above,\nand subsequently with Cy3 or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for\n2 hours at room temperature.\nElectron Microscopy\nAnesthetized rats were \ufb01xed by cardiac perfusion with 2% paraformalde-\nhyde/2% glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer. Brain\ntissues were quickly excised and subsequently immersed in the same \ufb01xative\novernight at 4\u00b0C. Using Rodent Brain Matrices (ASI Instruments, Warren, MI,\nUSA) 1-mm-thick brain slices were made. The samples were post \ufb01xed with\n2% OsO 4in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C in the dark, block-\nstained in 1% uranyl acetate for 1 hour, dehydrated with a graded series of\naqueous alcohol solutions, and embedded in Epon 812 (TAAB, Barks, UK).\nSilver sections were cut with an ultramicrotome (Leica UC6; Leica\nMicrosystems, Vienna, Austria), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate,\nand observed with an electron microscope (HT7700; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).\nWestern Blot\nAll procedures were performed at 4\u00b0C. To prepare samples for westernblot, corpus callosum tissues were extracted from rat brains, and trans-ferred into 700 mL homogenization buffer (0.25 mol/L sucrose, 0.15 mol/L\nKCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA)\ncontaining Protease Inhibitor (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), and\nhomogenized with 3 \u00d7 10 strokes using a Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton\nScienti \ufb01c, Millville, NJ, USA). The homogenates were centrifuged\n10 minutes at 700 g. The supernatant was collected and \ufb01ltered through\nlayers of cheesecloth and centrifuged 15 minutes at 12,000 g. The \ufb01nal\nsupernatant was referred to as cytosol and used for western blotting.\n21\nWestern blots were performed according to published methods.6Brie\ufb02y,\nequal amounts of total protein for each sample were loaded on 10% SDS-\npolyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred\nonto nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were subsequently probed\nwith the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-SMI 31 (1:2,000;\nCovance), rabbit anti-phosphorylated Akt (Ser 473, 1:1,000; Cell Signaling\nTechnology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-Akt (1:2,000; Cell Signaling\nTechnology), rabbit anti-phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homologdeleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN, Ser 380/Thr 382/383, 1:1,000; Cell\nSignaling Technology), rabbit anti-PTEN (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technol-\nogy), rabbit anti-phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR,\nSer 2448, 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-mTOR (1:1,000;\nCell Signaling Technology), rat anti-MBP (1:2,000; Millipore), rabbit anti-\ncarnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A, 1:1,000; Millipore) and CPT2\n(1:1,000; Millipore), and mouse monoclonal anti- \u03b2-actin (1:10,000; Abcam,\nCambridge, MA, USA). Protein levels of PTEN, Akt, mTOR, and \u03b2-actin were\nused as internal controls. Western blots were performed from at least three\nindividual experiments.\nImage Acquisition and Quanti \ufb01cation\nFor histologic experiments, the number of stained cells and the density of\naxons were analyzed in three coronal sections at 200 \u03bcm intervals in each\nrat brain. Two images in the corpus callosum per section were acquired,\nand ss-DNA-positive cells were counted in the entire area of the corpus\ncallosum. A confocal microscope (LEICA TCS SP5 II, Leica Microsystems)\nwith a 40 \u00d7 objective was used to acquire the images. Images wereanalyzed using the National Institutes of Health Image analysis program\nversion 1.43, as described previously.17Brie\ufb02y, the pNFH+-MBP+areas wereL-carnitine effects on axonal plasticity\nY Ueno et al\n383\n\u00a9 2015 ISCBFM Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 382 \u2013391\nsplit into green and red channels, and images showing common positive\nareas in both channels were obtained. The intensity levels were then\ndigitally adjusted with pixel intensity thresholds (black pixels represent\npNFH+-MBP+immunoreactive areas). The total area of black pixels was\ndivided by the total area in each image to estimate the degree of axonalplasticity and myelination after LBCCA. Electron microscopy image analysis\ninvolved estimating the number of myelinated axons in the corpus\ncallosum. Only myelinated axon pro \ufb01les with diameters greater than\n0.5\u03bcm were included in the counts.22Thirty to forty axons were randomly\ncounted in prede \ufb01ned bilateral areas of the corpus callosum in each rat\nbrain. All in vivo experiments and measurements were performed in a\nblinded and randomized manner.\nStatistical Analysis\nValues presented in this study are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Allstatistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for theSocial Sciences (version 15; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Student \u2019st-test and\none-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests were used when\ncomparing two groups and greater than two groups, respectively. Chi-\nsquare tests were used for comparisons of the number of axons accordingto the axonal diameter among groups. A probability value of o0.05 was\nconsidered as signi \ufb01cant.\nRESULTS\nTemporal Changes in Cerebral Blood Flow after Ligation of Both\nCommon Carotid Arteries\nFigure 1A shows the temporal changes in CBF in each group.\nAfter LBCCA, CBF gradually increased in the vehicle- and\nL-carnitine-treated rats up to 28 days after LBCCA. There were\nno signi \ufb01cant differences in CBF between the vehicle and\nL-carnitine-treated rats.\nEffects of L-Carnitine on Learning Memory and Motor Function\nBefore LBCCA, the majority of the rats escaped within 10 seconds\nafter training in the Morris water maze task. The escape latencies\nof the sham-operated group were within 10 seconds up to 28 daysafter LBCCA. The escape latency of the vehicle group graduallyincreased from 7 to 28 days after LBCCA. At 21 and 28 days after\nLBCCA, the escape latency of the vehicle group signi \ufb01cantly\nincreased compared with the sham-operated group ( Po0.01,\nFigure 1B). The L-carnitine-treated rats exhibited shorter latencies\nthan the vehicle-treated group. In particular, at 21 and 28 days\nafter LBCCA the escape latency was signi \ufb01cantly different between\nthe vehicle and L-carnitine groups ( Po0.05, Figure 1B). In the\nrotarod test, the step out latency did not change after LBCCA, and\nthere were no signi \ufb01cant differences among the sham-operated,\nvehicle-treated, and L-carnitine-treated rats at each time point(Figure 1C). These data suggest that L-carnitine improves\ncognitive dysfunction induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion\nin the Morris water maze task, while motor function in the rotarodtest was not impaired after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.\nL-carnitine Sustained Cell Viability in Corpus Callosum\nThe ss-DNA staining experiments indicated that ss-DNA\n+cells\nwere substantially increased from 7 to 28 days after LBCCA from\nbaseline. However, L-carnitine signi \ufb01cantly reduced the number of\nss-DNA+cells at each time point after LBCCA compared with the\nvehicle group ( Po0.05, Figures 1D and 1E).\nL-carnitine Enhances Axonal Plasticity after Chronic Hypoperfusion\nThe pNFH is an abundant architectural cytoskeletal element in\naxons, participates in axonal growth, and regulates synapticfunction.23,24On western blot analysis, pNFH density decreased at\n14 and 28 days after LBCCA in the vehicle-treated rats. However,\nL-carnitine signi \ufb01cantly increased the density of pNFH compared\nwith the vehicle-treated rats at 28 days after LBCCA ( Po0.05,Figures 2A and 2B). A signi \ufb01cant decrease in phosphorylated\nphosphatase and PTEN at 28 days after LBCCA was observed\nin L-carnitine-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated rats\n(Po0.05, Figure 3A), together with an elevation of phosphory-\nlated Akt and phosphorylated mTOR ( Po0.05, Figures 3B and 3C).\nOur data suggest that L-carnitine enhances pNFH expression\nrelated to regulation of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway after chronic\ncerebral hypoperfusion.\nL-carnitine Reduces Lipid Peroxidation and Oxidative DNA\nDamage in Oligodendrocytes\nMBP is a marker of mature oligodendrocytes. Our data show that\nMBP levels gradually decreased in vehicle-treated rats and\nincrease in L-carnitine-treated rats from baseline after LBCCA. At\n28 days after LBCCA, L-carnitine signi \ufb01cantly increases MBP levels\ncompared with vehicle-treated rats ( Po0.05, Figures 2A and 2C).\nThe number of oligodendrocytes in vehicle-treated rats signi \ufb01-\ncantly decreased from baseline at 28 days after LBCCA, while the\nnumber of oligodendrocytes in L-carnitine-treated rats was notsubstantially altered ( Po0.05, Figures 2D and 2E). To examine\noxidative stress in WMLs after LBCCA, lipid peroxidation and\noxidative DNA damage were assessed using HNE and 8OHdGstaining, respectively. In the vehicle-treated group, HNE\n+cells\ngradually but substantially increased at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after\nLBCCA compared with the sham-operated group ( Po0.001,\nFigures 4A and 4B). In the L-carnitine-treated group, HNE+cells\nalso increased at each time point after LBCCA. However, HNE+\ncells were signi \ufb01cantly decreased at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after\nLBCCA compared with the vehicle-treated group ( Po0.05, Figures\n4A and 4B). In the vehicle-treated group, 8OHdG+cells were\nsubstantially increased at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days compared withthe sham-operated group ( Po0.001, Figures 4C and 4D).\nL-carnitine signi \ufb01cantly reduced the number of 8OHdG+cells\ncompared with the vehicle-treated group, and there were nosigni \ufb01cant differences in the number of 8OHdG+cells between the\nsham-operated group and the L-carnitine-treated group ( Po0.01,\nFigures 4C and 4D). Previously, we showed that HNE+and 8OHdG+\ncells in the corpus callosum were colocalized with GST-pi+cells, a\nmarker of oligodendrocytes.6In the current study, HNE+cells were\ncolocalized to GST-pi+oligodendrocytes (Figure 4E) after LBCCA.\nL-carnitine Enhances Myelin Sheath Growth and Facilitates\nMyelination of Axons\nTo examine alterations in axon \u2013oligodendrocyte interactions after\nLBCCA, we measured the diameter of myelin sheaths using doubleimmuno \ufb02uorescence staining. The diameter of MBP+oligoden-\ndrocyte processes decreased at 28 days after LBCCA in vehicle-\ntreated rats from baseline levels ( Po0.05, Figure 5A). However,\nL-carnitine substantially increased the diameter of MBP+myelin\nsheaths compared with vehicle-treated rats at 28 days ( Po0.001,\nFigure 5A). To analyze myelin sheath thickness in more detail, we\nused electron microscopy. After LBCCA, myelin sheath thickness invehicle-treated rats gradually decreased over time from baseline\nlevels (Figure 5B). However, L-carnitine-treated rats exhibited\nsubstantially increased myelin sheath thickness after LBCCA(Figure 5B). Myelin sheaths in L-carnitine-treated rats were signi \ufb01-\ncantly thicker than those in sham-operated and vehicle-treated\nrats at 28 days after LBCCA ( Po0.001, Figure 5C). Concurrently,\npNFH\n+axons were well myelinated by MBP+oligodendrocytes\nin the corpus callosum of L-carnitine-treated rats ( Po0.05,\nFigure 5D). Thus, axonal damage and oxidative damage in oligo-\ndendrocytes were induced after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.\nThe aforementioned data suggest that continuous treatment withL-carnitine suppresses oxidative stress in oligodendrocytes after\nLBCCA, and enhances oligodendrocyte marker expression as well\nas axonal plasticity, thereby facilitating myelination of axons in thechronic stage of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.L-carnitine effects on axonal plasticity\nY Ueno et al\n384\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 382 \u2013391 \u00a9 2015 ISCBFM\nImprovement of Carnitine Homeostasis\nTo examine mitochondrial membrane transport function, CPT1A\nand CPT2, inner and outer mitochondrial membrane transporter\nenzymes, were analyzed using western blots. After LBCCA, proteinlevels of CPT1A and CPT2 decreased in vehicle-treated rats.\nL-carnitine signi \ufb01cantly increased CPT1A and CPT2 levels at\n28 days after LBCCA compared with vehicle-treated rats, indicat-\ning that L-carnitine improves impairment of mitochondrial\nmembrane function induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion\nFigure 1.

Thus, it is suggested that improved\nmitochondrial membrane function may be associated withincreased axonal plasticity and myelination after L-carnitinetreatment after LBCCA.\nDISCUSSION\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst study to examine the\neffect of L-carnitine against WMLs under chronic hypoperfusion.\nThe principal \ufb01ndings presented here were that, in a rat cerebralchronic hypoperfusion model, L-carnitine: enhanced pNFH levels\nrelated to the regulation of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway;suppressed lipid peroxidation products and oxidative DNAdamage; sustained cell viability; stimulated myelin sheath growth;\nfacilitated myelination of pNFH\n+axons; improved mitochondrial\nmembrane function in the corpus callosum; and improved spatiallearning and memory.\nAlthough CBF measured by laser Doppler \ufb02owmetry does not\ndirectly represent tissue \ufb02ow in white matter, development of\nWMLs is linked to alterations in CBF.5\u20137In the acute phase,\nFigure 2.

The chronic phase lasts 8\nto 12 weeks after the acute phase and is characterized bycompensatory increases in CBF viacollateral vessels.5During the\nchronic phase, in \ufb02ammatory changes, oxidative stress, and astro-\ngliosis are induced in white matter, and the degree of histologic\nchange in WMLs is consistent with the decreases in CBF.25Thecurrent data showed that continuous treatment with L-carnitine\ndid not affect CBF but improved WMLs. Thus, it is suggested that\nL-carnitine exerted direct neuroprotective effects against LBCCA\ninjury.\nStroke induces an acute loss of pNFH+axons in mammalian\nbrains.26Previously, it was reported that pNFH+axons were\nincreased in the peri-infarct cortex during stroke recovery in a rat\nmodel of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, and that\nFigure 3.

Additionally, phosphorylated Akt andmTOR were expressed in pNFH+axons.

Intriguingly, continuous treatment with L-carnitine\nincreases MBP expression and axonal myelination from baseline\nlevels. Although stroke mediates free radical formation and injuresoligodendrocytes and axons, the current data suggest thatL-carnitine not only exerts an antioxidant effect through the\nsuppression of lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage,\nbut may also facilitate development and myelination of\nFigure 4. carnitine reduces oxidative stress in oligodendrocytes after chronic hypoperfusion.
