The results showed that enzymatic hydrolysis significantly increased hydrolysate solubility and \nreduced average particle size compared to those of DM whey protein. Neutrase and Flavourzyme hydrolysates \nexhibited higher degrees of hydrolysis (DH), along with elevated emulsification properties and surface hydro -\nphobicity. The choice of protease influenced secondary and tertiary protein structures and amino acid compo -\nsition. Enzymatic hydrolysis led to decreased molecular weight of DM whey proteins. Moreover, all hydrolysates \nexhibited higher fluorescence intensity at \u03bbmax compared to DM whey protein, implying distinct properties due to \nthe varied impacts of the four proteases on DM whey protein structure. The preparation of hydrolysates from DM \nwhey proteins using proteases contributes to the development of integrated-value DM products.   \n1.Introduction \nDonkey milk (DM) boasts nutritional advantages, low fat, and hy-\npoallergenic properties, making it a commendable alternative to human \nmilk with similarities in lactose and mineral content, fatty acids, and \nprotein profiles. Additionally, DM whey protein, a valuable by-product \nin the dairy industry, is rich in nutrients, comprising proteins such as \n\u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-La), \u03b2-lactoglobulin (\u03b2-Lg), immunoglobulins, and to a \nlesser extent, lysozyme and lactoferrin (Ambrosi, Polenta, Gonzalez, \nFerrari, & Maresca, 2016 ). In particular, the lysozyme content of DM is \nsignificantly higher than that of human milk, bovine milk, and other \nmilk sources. The presence of lysozyme imparts bactericidal properties \nto DM by disrupting bacterial cell walls. Enzymatic hydrolysis of DM \nwhey proteins can generate bioactive peptides with various functional \nproperties, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, anti- \ninflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities (Garhwal et al., \n2022 ). These bioactive peptides have the potential to be used in func-\ntional foods, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the development and utilisation of DM whey proteins has great commercial \nvalue and potential. However, the utilisation of DM whey protein is \ncurrently limited to DM products, and its economic benefits remain \nunderexplored. \nIn recent years, the preparation of bioactive peptides by enzymatic \nhydrolysis of proteins for application in food and other fields has \nattracted attention. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been widely recognised in \nthe fields of food, medicine, and healthcare because of its high speci -\nficity, high product safety, and mild production conditions (Wang et al., \n2023 ; Wu, Zhang, Jia, Kuang, & Yang, 2018 ). In addition, hydrolysates \nprepared using proteases improve several functional properties of pro-\nteins by cleaving peptide bonds, leading to a reduction in molecular \nweight, exposure of hydrophobic groups, and changes in hydrophobicity \nand polarity. Numerous studies have underscored the potential of \nbioactive peptides derived from whey proteins. For instance, research \nimplementing A. oryzae LBA 01 (AO) protease to enzymatically hydro -\nlyse whey proteins demonstrated an enhanced antioxidant capacity (de \nCastro & Sato, 2014 ). Another study also found that \u03b1-chymotrypsin \nAbbreviations: CD, Circular dichroism; DH, Degrees of hydrolysis; DM, Donkey milk; DWPH, Donkey milk whey protein hydrolysates; EAI, Emulsifying activity \nindex; ESI, Emulsion stability index; FC, Foaming capacity; FS, Foam stability; FT-IR, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry; PBS, Phosphate buffer solution; PDI, \nPolydispersity index; PPH, Peanut protein hydrolysates. \n*Corresponding author at: College of Light Industry, Liaoning University, No.66 Chongshan Middle Road, Huanggu District, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, PR \nChina. \nE-mail address: liweixuan@lnu.edu.cn (W.

Alcalase, Neutrase, papain, Favourzyme and bromelain \nare often widely used in the preparation of whey protein hydrolysates. \nSeveral studies have shown that milk whey protein hydrolysates exert \nhypoglycaemic (Du et al., 2022 ), and antimicrobial activities (Abdel- \nHamid, Goda, De Gobba, Jenssen, & Osman, 2016 ). DM whey proteins \nare abundant, rich in composition, hypoallergenic, and have a variety of \nbiofunctional activities. Zhou et al. (2023) obtained DM whey protein \npeptides using neutrase and found that they regulated the gut micro -\nbiota and delayed aging in mice. However, reports on the effects of \ndifferent proteases on the structural and processing characteristics of \nDM whey proteins are rare. Selecting the most suitable type of protease \nto maximise the functional properties of protein hydrolysis products is \nimportant in dairy processing. \nTherefore, structural changes in DM whey protein hydrolysates were \nanalysed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electropho -\nresis (SDS-PAGE) apparatus, fluorescence spectrophotometry, Fourier \ntransform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), and circular dichroism (CD) \nspectrophotometry. Further comparisons of solubility, emulsification, \nand foaming were performed to investigate the changes in the process -\ning properties. The antioxidant activity of DM whey protein hydroly -\nsates was assessed by studying the scavenging effect on three free \nradicals: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl radical (\u22c5OH), \nand 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium \nsalt (ABTS). This study serves as a valuable step toward exploring the \napplication of DM whey protein bioactive hydrolysates in the food \nindustry. \n2.Materials and methods \n2.1. Materials \nDM whey protein was purchased from Kangze Biotechnology Co., \nLtd. (Shaanxi, China). All reagents, including enzymes, were of analyt -\nical purity and purchased from Shenyang Lab Science and Trade Co., \nLtd. (Liaoning, China). The enzyme exhibited an activity of 20,000 U/g. \n2.2. Preparation of DM whey protein hydrolysates \nThe DM whey protein solution (6%, w/v) was heated in a water bath \nat 85 \u2022C for 10 min to denature the DM whey protein. Subsequently, \nwhen the solution cooled, proteases were added to the solution for \nenzymatic hydrolysation. The DM whey proteins were digested with \nAlcalase (pH \u00889.0, 55 \u2022C), Neutrase (pH \u00887.0, 50 \u2022C), papain (pH \u0088\n7.0, 50 \u2022C) and Flavourzyme (pH \u00887.0, 50 \u2022C) for 4 h at a constant \ntemperature (E/S \u00884:100). The hydrolysis conditions based on our \nprevious studies. \nDuring the enzymatic reaction, ultrasound was used for 20 min to \nassist the enzymatic process, and the pH of the solution was measured \nevery 30 min. The desired pH was maintained by adding NaOH (1 M) or \nHCl (1 M). After hydrolysis, the protease was inactivated in a boiling \nwater bath for 10 min, rapidly cooled to 25 \u2022C, pH adjusted to 7, and \ncentrifuged at 8000 \u00d7g for 10 min at 4 \u2022C. The donkey milk whey protein \nhydrolysates (DWPHs), namely Alcalase hydrolysates (Alcalase-DWPH), \nNeutrase hydrolysates (Neutase-DWPH), papain hydrolysates (papain- \nDWPH), and Flavourzyme hydrolysates (Flavourzyme-DWPH), were \nobtained by collecting and freeze-drying the supernatant. \n2.3. Determination of protein content and solubility \nProtein content: The protein content in the supernatant of the hy-\ndrolysates was determined using a BCA protein concentration assay kit \n(Suzhou Grace Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) (Cort\u02d8es-R\u00edos et al., 2020 ; \nSmith et al., 1985 ). A working solution of BCA was prepared by mixing \nreagent A (BCA, Na2CO3, NaHCO 3, dicinchoninic acid, and sodium tartrate in 0.1 M NaOH) with reagent B (CuSO 4, 4%) in a 50:1 ratio, as \nindicated by the manufacturer. The samples and the BCA working so-\nlution were incubated for 30 min, pipetted into a 96-well plate, and the \nOD value was measured at 562 nm. The protein content was calculated \nbased on a standard curve. \nProtein solubility: The soluble content of the DWPHs was deter -\nmined using the Folin \u2013Lowry method (An et al., 2022 ). A solution of \nFolin \u2013Ciocalteu Phenol Reagent A with Na2CO3, NaOH, CuSO 4, and \npotassium sodium tartrate was prepared. The sample solution (10 mg/ \nmL) was mixed with an equal volume of 15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), \nleft to stand for 10 min, and then centrifuged (CR21N, Hitachi, Japan). \nThe supernatant was diluted 10-fold with TCA. Subsequently, 1 mL of \nthe diluted solution was mixed with 5 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu Phenol \nReagent A solution, allowed to stand for 10 min, and then 0.5 mL of \nFolin-Phenol Reagent B (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co, Ltd., \nBeijing, China) was added to the mixture and shaken immediately. The \nsolution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the \nabsorbance was determined at 540 nm. DWPH content was calculated \nbased on a previously established standard curve (y \u00880.0621\u00d7\u0087\n0.0026). Protein solubility was determined as the ratio of protein con-\ntent to DM whey protein content in the supernatant. \n2.4. Degree of hydrolysis (DH) determination \nDH of DM whey protein hydrolysates was determined using the O- \nphthaldialdehyde (OPA) method. Specifically, Serine (400 \u03bcL) was \nadded to 3 mL of OPA reagent, and the reaction was carried out for 5 s. \nAfter vortex mixing (vortex-1, Shanghai Huxi Industrial Co., Ltd., China) \nfor 5 s and incubating at room temperature for 2 min, the absorbance \nwas measured at 340 nm, and a standard curve was plotted (y \u0088\n0.8871\u00d7\u00870.092). A sample solution (5 mg/mL) was selected to \ndetermine the absorbance according to the above steps, and DH was \ncalculated using the following formula (Nielsen, Petersen, & Dam-\nbmann, 2001 ): \nDH\u0085%\u0086\u0088C\u00d7N\u00d7M\nm\u0000\u03b2\n\u03b1htot\u00d7100 (1)  \nwhere htot, \u03b2, and \u03b1 depend on the type of raw material and htot is the \ntotal number of peptide bonds in the protein. For whey protein, htot \u0088\n8.8, \u03b2 \u00880.40, and \u03b1 \u00881.000. \nC represents serine concentration (mg/mL), N is the dilution factor, V \nis the volume of the sample solution (mL), and m is the sample mass \n(mg). \n2.5. Amino acid composition analysis \nAccording to the method described by Zhang et al. (2007), 20 mg \nsamples (accurate to 0.1 mg) were added to a 20 mL vial and dissolved in \n8 mL of 6 M HCl. Each vial was filled with nitrogen to prevent oxidation. \nAfter hydrolysis at 110 \u2022C for 24 h, the sample was diluted to 50 mL. \nSubsequently, 2 mL sample was taken into an evaporating dish for \nevaporation, during which the concentration was rinsed several times \nwith distilled water. The samples were then treated with 0.02 M sulfo-\nsalicylic acid and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm membrane filter. The amino \nacid composition of DWPHs was determined using an automatic amino \nacid analyser (L-8800, Hitachi, Ltd., Japan). \n2.6. Analysis of structural characteristics \n2.6.1. SDS-PAGE analysis \nThe electrophoresis mode of DWPHs sample was adjusted appro -\npriately, according to the method described by Wang et al. (2014) . \nPolyacrylamide gel included 15% separation gel and 5% concentrated \ngel. Hydrolysates samples (10 \u03bcL, 10 mg/mL) generated by different \nproteases were mixed with buffers (10 \u03bcL, SDS, DTT, Tris HCl, M. Wei et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nFood Chemistry: X 22 (2024) 101360\n3bromophenol blue, and glycerol). The mixture was analysed using a dual \nvertical electrophoresis system (BG-verMIDI, Beijing Baygene Biotech \nCo., Ltd., Beijing, China). The initial voltage was 80 V, and the operation \nwas continued at 120 V for 2 h. The gel images were analysed using an \nimage lab (Gel Doc XR, Bio-Rad, USA). \n2.6.2. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy \nFT-IR (Nicolet, Thermo Electron, USA) was used to analyse the sec-\nondary structural characteristics of different DM whey protein hydro -\nlysates. The samples were mixed with dried KBr (1:100, w/w) and \npressed into thin slices. Thirty-two scans at 2 cm\u00001 resolution analyses \nwere performed at the spectral range of 4000 cm\u00001 to 400 cm\u00001. \n2.6.3. CD spectroscopy \nA 1 mg/mL hydrolysates solution with phosphate buffer solution \n(PBS) was analysed at 25 \u2022C via CD spectrophotometry (JASCO J-810, \nJapan Spectroscopy Company), using a quartz cuvette with a 0.1 cm \noptical pathlength in the far-U V range (190 \u2013250 nm). \n2.6.4. Fluorescence spectra measurement \nFluorescence spectra of the samples were detected using a fluores -\ncence spectrophotometer (F-7100; Hitachi, Japan) with a 1 cm width \nquartz cuvette. Hydrolysate samples (5 mg/mL) were diluted with PBS \n(pH 7.0, 0.1 M) for measurement. The excitation and emission wave -\nlengths of the fluorescence photometer were 280 nm and 300\u2013460 nm, \nrespectively. The working voltage was 750 V, and the slit width was set \nto 5 nm with a 300 nm/min scan rate. \n2.6.5. Surface hydrophobicity \nSurface hydrophobicity of the samples was determined using an ANS \nfluorescent probe. Samples (0.3 mg/mL) were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.0, \n0.1 M). Subsequently, 10 \u03bcL of 8.0 mM ANS was mixed with 4 mL \nsamples solution, and the fluorescence intensity of the shaken mixture \nwas measured. The excitation wavelength was 350 nm, and the scanning \nwavelength range was 390\u2013650 nm. Two slit widths were set (2.5 nm), \nand the working voltage was 750 V. \n2.7. Analysis of processing characteristics \n2.7.1. Foaming capacity and foam stability \nThe foaming capacity (FC) and foam stability (FS) of DWPHs were \nmeasured. DWPHs (0.4g) were dissolved in 20mL of PBS (pH 7.0, 0.01 \nM) in a 50mL tube, and foam was prepared using a homogeniser (XHF- \nDY; Xinzhi Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China) at 10,000 \u00d7g for 2min. The \nfoam volume was recorded at 0 (V0) and 30 min (V30) of standing. The \nFC and FS were calculated as follows (Tadesse et al., 2023 ): \nFC\u0085%\u0086\u0088V0\u0000V\nV\u00d7100 (2)  \nFS\u0085%\u0086\u0088V30\u0000V\nV\u00d7100 (3)  \nwhere V is the initial volume, V0 is the total volume after homogenisa -\ntion, and V30 is the total volume after standing for 30min. \n2.7.2. Emulsifying properties \nThe emulsifying activity index (EAI) and emulsion stability index \n(ESI) were determined using the methods of Nalinanon, Benjakul, \nKishimura, and Shahidi (2011) with some slight modifications. Soybean \noil (7 mL) and DWPH solution (1 mg/mL, 21 mL) were mixed and \nhomogenised (XHF-DY; NingBo Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) \nat 10,000 \u00d7g for 2 min. An aliquot of the emulsion (50 \u03bcL) was pipetted \nfrom the middle portion of the tube at 0 and 15 min after homogeni -\nsation and subsequently diluted 100-fold using 0.1% (w/v) SDS solution. \nThe absorbance of diluted emulsions was measured at 500 nm after 5 s of \nshaking in a vortex mixer, and 0.1% SDS was used as the blank control. The EAI and ESI were calculated using the following formulas: \nEAI\u0000\nm2\\\ng)\n\u00882\u00d72B303\u00d7DF\u00d7A0\n\u03c6\u00d7c\u00d7L\u00d710000(4)  \nwhere A0 is the absorbance at 0 min, DF is the dilution factor (100), L is \nthe path length of the cuvette (cm), \u03c6 is the oil volume fraction (0.25), \nand C is the DWPH concentration (mg/mL). \nESI\u0085min\u0086\u0088A0\u00d7\u0394t\n\u0394A(5)  \nwhere \u0394A \u0088A0 -A15 and \u0394t \u008815 min. \n2.7.3. Particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) \nThe average particle size of the DWPH samples were determined \nusing a Zetasizer (Nano-ZS; Malvern Ltd., UK) instrument. The concen -\ntration of the samples was diluted to 1 mg/mL with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0). \nAverage particle size was measured at room temperature. \n2.8. Antioxidant activity \n2.8.1. DPPH scavenging activity \nFollowing the method outlined by Wali et al. (2019) , a 0.1 mM DPPH \nsolution was prepared using ethanol. Each sample (3 mL, 2.5 mg/mL) \nwas mixed with a DPPH (2 mL) solution and ethanol (2 mL). The mixture \nwas incubated for 30 min after vortexing (vortex-1, Shanghai Huxi In-\ndustrial Co., Ltd., China), and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. \nThe DPPH scavenging activity was calculated as follows: \nDPPH scavenging effect\u0085%\u0086\u0088\u230a\n1\u0000A1\u0000A2\nA0\u230b\n\u00d7100 (6)  \nwhere, A0 is the absorbance of the DPPH solution without the sample, A1 \nis the absorbance of the sample mixed with the DPPH solution, and A2 is \nthe absorbance of ethanol without DPPH. \n2.8.2. \u22c5OH scavenging activity \nApproximately 2 mL of FeSO 4 (6 mM) and 2 mL a salicylic acid-\n\u2013ethanol solution (6 mM) was added to 2 mL of DWPH solutions (2.5 \nmg/mL). Finally, 2 mL of H2O2 (6 mM) was added to initiate the reac-\ntion, and the mixture was stored at 37 \u2022C for 30 min. Absorbance of the \nmixture was measured at 510 nm. The capability of \u22c5OH scavenging was \nmeasured using the following equation: \n\u22c5OHscavenging effect\u0085%\u0086\u0088\u230a\n1\u0000A1\u0000A2\nA0\u230b\n\u00d7100 (7)  \nwhere A0 is the absorbance of the control group (H2O \u0087salicylic), A1 is \nthe absorbance of the sample group (sample \u0087salicylic), and A2 is the \nabsorbance of the control group (sample \u0087H2O). \n2.8.3. ABTS radical scavenging activity \nABTS radical scavenging activity was determined as previously \ndescribed (Wang et al., 2021 ). A 10 mL solution of 7 mM ABTS and 176 \n\u03bcL of 2.45 mM potassium persulfate were allowed to react at 4 \u2022C for 14 \nh in the absence of light. The mixture was then prepared as a stock so-\nlution with ethanol to give an absorbance of 0.7 \u00b10.02 (734 nm). \nSubsequently, 0.8 mL of DWPH samples were mixed with 3.2 mL stock \nsolution and incubated at room temperature for 6 min in the dark. The \nabsorbance was measured at 734 nm, and the ABTS radical scavenging \nactivity was calculated as follows: \nABTS scavenging effect\u0085%\u0086\u0088\u230a\n1\u0000A1\nA0\u230b\n\u00d7100 (8)  \nwhere A0 is the absorbance of ethanol and the ABTS radical and A1 is the \nabsorbance of the sample and the ABTS radical.

Statistical analysis \nEach sample was measured in triplicate, and data were presented as \nmeans \u00b1standard deviation. Statistical analyses were performed using \nSPSS software (version 22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences \namong means were detected using Duncan \u2019s multiple range test (P D\n0.05). \n3.Results and discussion \n3.1. Protein content and solubility \nThe standard curve for protein content calculations, y \u00880.188\u00d7- \n0.0046 (R2 \u00880.9987), was obtained using the BCA Protein Content \nAssay Kit. Based on the standard curve, the concentration of DM whey \nprotein was 0.8942 mg/mL. The results of the hydrolysates obtained \nusing the four enzymatic methods are shown in Fig. 1A. The protein \nconcentrations of the four DWPHs were 0.6331 (Alcalase-DWPH), \n0.7571 (Neutrase-DWPH), 0.8048 (papain-DWPH), and 0.8016 (Fla-\nvourzyme-DWPH) mg/mL (P D0.05). Notably, Neutrase-DWPH, \npapain-DWPH, and Flavourzyme-DWPH exhibited the highest concen -\ntrations, possibly attributed to the extensive peptide bond cleavage by \npapain and flavour enzymes, resulting in a greater diversity of small \nproteins/peptides and increased protein concentrations (Nalinanon \net al., 2011 ). \nSolubility is mainly associated with the distribution of hydrophobic \nand hydrophilic amino acids in proteins and is also influenced by the \nthermodynamics of protein \u2013water interactions (Kristinsson & Rasco, \n2000 ). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the solubility of Neutrase-DWPH, \npapain-DWPH, and Flavourzyme-DWPH were close to 80%, all of \nwhich were higher than those of Alcalase-DWPH (71.11%) and DM \nwhey protein (47.74%) (P D0.05). A previous study applied porcine \ntrypsin, papain, and Neutrase to the enzymatic hydrolysis of bovine \nwhey proteins to compare solubility and found that the type of enzyme \nand pH affected solubility, with the hydrolysate of trypsin being \ncompletely soluble at a neutral pH (Monti & Jost, 1978 ). It has been \nsuggested that when proteins are enzymatically hydrolysed, the for-\nmation of smaller peptides or proteins, as well as the presence of newly \nexposed amino and carboxyl groups during bond breaking, promote \nmore interactions with water and increase hydrophilicity, which in turn \nimproves the solubility of proteins (Kristinsson & Rasco, 2000 ). Our results showed that enzymatic hydrolysis significantly increased the \nsolubility of DM whey proteins (P D0.05). Furthermore, the effective -\nness of the four proteases varied when acting on DM, with Alcalase being \nsignificantly less effective than the other three proteases on DM whey \nproteins (P D0.05). \n3.2. DH \nDH, representing the extent of enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins or \npolypeptides, is depicted in Fig. 1B. DH values varied among different \nDWPHs depending on the enzyme used. The DH values of the DWPHs \nshowed significant differences (P D0.05), with the highest being that of \nFlavourzyme (39.46%), followed by that of Neutrase (30.36%), and the \nlowest being that of papain-DWPH (12.73%). Wu et al. (2018) investi -\ngated the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on the physicochemical \nproperties of bovine whey protein enzymatic hydrolysis and found that \nDH of the ultrasonic whey protein hydrolysate was D15%. In a separate \nstudy on bovine whey protein hydrolysis, after treatment with Alcalase \nand papain, the DH was found to be 15.9%. This discrepancy may arise \nfrom differences in enzymatic hydrolysis, site of action, and the number \nof hydrolysed peptide bonds. \nFurthermore, according to a previous study, DH is positively corre -\nlated with the ability of the hydrolysis process to disrupt peptide bonds, \nwith a higher DH value representing a higher number of short-chain \npeptides in the hydrolysate (Charoenphun, Cheirsilp, Sirinupong, & \nYouravong, 2012 ). \nIn a prior study on the enzymatic hydrolysis of myofibrillar proteins, \npapain demonstrated a higher DH than Alcalase and Flavourzyme, \nattributed to its broader range of action and its tenderising function \n(Najafian & Babji, 2015 ). In our current study focusing on DM whey \nprotein enzymatic hydrolysis, the altered target may have influenced the \nsite of action, leading to a greater extent of hydrolysis by Flavourzyme, \nresulting in potentially higher numbers of short-chain peptides in \nFlavourzyme-DWPH. Despite this, the enzyme \u2019s specificity in site of \naction prevents achieving a DH of 100% (Ningsih, Raharjo, Haryadi, & \nWikandari, 2023 ). This result was similar to previous reports in which \nwhey proteins of goat milk were hydrolysed by trypsin, and their DH \nvalues did not reach 100% (Ningsih et al., 2023 ). Thus, Flavorzymes and \nNeutrases are more hydrolytic in DM. \nFig. 1.The content and solubility of DWPHs and whey protein hydrolysed by different protease (A).

Wei et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nFood Chemistry: X 22 (2024) 101360\n53.3. Amino acid composition analysis \nThe amino acid compositions of DM whey protein and its hydroly -\nsates are shown in Table 1. The total amino acid content of DWPHs was \nsignificantly higher than that of DM whey proteins (P D0.05). This in-\ndicates that enzymatic hydrolysis promotes the release of low- \nmolecular-weight peptides and free amino acids. The free amino acid \ncontent in Neutrase-DWPH and Flavourzyme-DWPH was much higher \nthan that in the other two hydrolysates, which positively correlated with \nthe DH results. A previous study examined the hydrolysis of tree peony \nseed proteins using different proteases and similarly found a positive \ncorrelation between DH and the amino acid content of the hydrolysates \n(Wang et al., 2021 ). DM whey protein and DWPHs had the same amino \nacid composition, with Glu, Leu and Asp being the most abundant amino \nacids among the samples. In particularly, Thr, Glu, Ala, Pro, and Lys \nwere the most abundant amino acids in the Neutrase, Papain, and Fla-\nvourzyme hydrolysates, but not in Alcalase-DWPH (P D0.05), indicating \nthat the high content of these amino acids might be attributed to dif-\nferences in the cleavage sites. A study comparing the essential amino \nacid (Val, Leu, Ile, Thr, Met, Phe, Tyr, and Lys) composition in donkey, \nbovine, and human milk proteins showed that DM has a higher pro-\nportion of the eight essential amino acids in the protein than the other \ntwo (Guo et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the amino acid composition of DM is relatively more suitable for human consumption. In particularly, \nenzyme hydrolysis reduces the molecular weight of DM whey protein \nand increases the amino acid content, which is easier for intestinal \ndigestion and absorption. \n3.4. SDS-PAGE electrophoretic profiles of DWPHs \nThe SDS-PAGE profiles of the DM whey proteins and DWPHs were \ncharacterised based on their protein constituents, as shown in Fig. 2A \nand Fig. 2B, respectively. The molecular weight profiles of DWPHs were \ndifferent from those of DM whey protein. As depicted in Fig. 2, the \nmolecular weight of DM whey protein was concentrated in the range of \n50\u2013100 kDa, which were mainly composed of serum albumin, immu -\nnoglobulins, and lactoferrin, and \u03b1-lactalbumin and \u03b2-lactoglobulin \nwere distributed between the range of 15\u201330 kDa (Ozturkoglu-Budak, \n2018 ). The electrophoretogram of Neutrase-DWPH (lane 2) and \nFlavourzyme-DWPH (lane 4) in Fig. 2B shows four major and clear \nbands at molecular weights of approximately 25, 23, 10, and 6.5 kDa, \nand a weak low-intensity band at 3 kDa. The intensities of the four \nprotein bands in Alcalase-DWPH and papain-DWPH (lanes 1 and 3) \nweakened or partially disappeared. Moreover, papain and Alcalase hy-\ndrolysates exhibited almost absent bands, while more weak bands \naccumulated near the 4.2 kD band, especially in lane 3. These variations \nin the protein bands among the hydrolysates may be related to bond \nspecificities and different conditions of protease action. The presence of \nhigh-intensity bands in Neutrase-DWPH and Flavourzyme-DWPH sug-\ngests that these two hydrolysates were more extensive than those pro-\nduced by the other two proteases, confirming the DH results. A study of \nthe enzymatic hydrolysis of camel whey protein with papain revealed \ntwo new low-molecular-weight bands (17\u201320 kDa) in the hydrolysate in \nthe SDS-PAGE spectra, suggesting that enzymatic hydrolysis was effec-\ntive in reducing the molecular weight of whey protein. Furthermore, \nLouren\u00e7o da Costa et al. (2007) used Alcalase, a-chymotrypsin, or Pro-\nteomix for the enzymatic degradation of whey proteins, observing the \nformation of low-molecular-weight peptides (two bands with an average \nmolecular weight of about 5.6 and 7.8 kDa) in the hydrolysates. In \nconclusion, enzymatic hydrolysis can reduce the molecular weight of \nDM whey proteins, yielding small-molecule peptides below 5 kDa. \n3.5. FT-IR analysis \nFT-IR is widely applied in a variety of fields, providing not only the \ncharacteristic vibrational absorption bands of molecular groups but also \nthe detection of changes in molecular groups and their surroundings \n(Hou et al., 2017 ). The secondary structures of the DWPHs were deter -\nmined via FT-IR spectroscopy to study the relationship between struc-\nture and function. As shown in Fig. 3A, there was strong absorption at \nwavenumbers between 3440 and 3070 cm\u00001 which are generally asso-\nciated with the vibrations of the hydroxyl group and the N\u2013H bond \nvibration. Generally, the N\u2013H expansion vibration ranges from 3400 to \n3440 cm\u00001, recognised as amide A band. When N\u2013H is bonded to the \ncarbonyl group in the peptide chain, the wavenumber experiences a blue \nshift to approximately 3300 cm\u00001. Protein repeats units exhibit several \ncharacteristic infrared absorption bands, including those of amides A, B, \nand I-VII. The amide I band (1700 \u20131600 cm\u00001) is closely related to the \nsecondary structure of proteins, with broad peaks in the O\u2013H stretching \nvibration indicating the presence of intramolecular or intermolecular \nhydrogen bonds (Wang et al., 2023 ). Moreover, absorbance bands at \n1642 cm\u00001 are associated with C\u2013\u2013C stretching vibration (Li et al., \n2020 ). Within the amide I band, characteristic spectral bands are mainly \nrelated to C\u2013\u2013O stretching vibrations and N\u2013H bending vibrations. The \namide II band, occurring between 1600 and 1500 cm\u00001, is primarily \ngenerated by N\u2013H stretching vibrations. The amide III band, situated \nwithin the 1320 \u20131200 cm\u00001 range, is mainly associated with C\u2013H \nstretching vibrations. \nIn addition, the distinct bands formed by the amide I band Table 1 \nAmino acid contents of whey protein and its hydrolysates prepared with Alca-\nlase, Neutrase, Papain, and Flavourzyme.  \nAA Whey protein \n(mg/g) A-DWPH \n(mg/g) N-DWPH \n(mg/g) P-DWPH \n(mg/g) F-DWPH \n(mg/g) \nAsp 21.74 \u00b10.93c 32.32 \u00b1\n1.48b 35.17 \u00b1\n0.90a 33.51 \u00b1\n0.43ab 35.93 \u00b1\n2.08a \nThr 8.94 \u00b10.36c 18.75 \u00b1\n0.96b 20.34 \u00b1\n0.60ab 20.11 \u00b1\n1.43ab 20.84 \u00b1\n1.30a \nSer 9.49 \u00b10.34c 13.53 \u00b1\n0.64b 14.39 \u00b1\n0.30ab 14.85 \u00b1\n0.58a 14.83 \u00b1\n0.74a \nGlu 25.39 \u00b11.25c 51.50 \u00b1\n2.43b 57.19 \u00b1\n1.55a 55.03 \u00b1\n0.21ab 58.76 \u00b1\n2.98a \nGly 14.66 \u00b10.34a 4.99 \u00b1\n0.19b 5.08 \u00b1\n0.11b 5.39 \u00b1\n0.21b 5.32 \u00b1\n0.20b \nAla 6.74 \u00b10.23c 12.01 \u00b1\n0.45b 13.18 \u00b1\n0.37a 13.14 \u00b1\n0.31a 13.65 \u00b1\n0.52a \nCys 8.39 \u00b10.27a 7.67 \u00b1\n0.14b 7.79 \u00b1\n0.16b 7.72 \u00b1\n0.12b 7.52 \u00b1\n0.12b \nVal 9.77 \u00b10.35c 16.70 \u00b1\n0.98b 17.93 \u00b1\n0.48ab 17.76 \u00b1\n0.37ab 18.53 \u00b1\n0.83a \nMet 2.57 \u00b10.24b 7.27 \u00b1\n0.22a 8.04 \u00b1\n0.16a 7.93 \u00b1\n0.44a 7.88 \u00b1\n0.69a \nIle 8.21 \u00b10.35c 17.07 \u00b1\n0.97b 19.08 \u00b1\n0.54a 18.98 \u00b1\n0.89a 19.63 \u00b1\n0.85a \nLeu 13.78 \u00b10.67c 35.83 \u00b1\n2.24b 38.66 \u00b1\n1.09ab 37.86 \u00b1\n0.79ab 39.72 \u00b1\n1.92a \nTyr 11.32 \u00b10.28b 12.62 \u00b1\n0.30a 12.56 \u00b1\n0.23a 13.15 \u00b1\n0.36a 12.92 \u00b1\n0.55a \nPhe 4.30 \u00b10.24b 7.05 \u00b1\n0.53a 7.52 \u00b1\n0.23a 7.78 \u00b1\n0.60a 7.76 \u00b1\n0.53a \nLys 12.13 \u00b10.53c 24.65 \u00b1\n1.31b 26.49 \u00b1\n0.69a 25.69 \u00b1\n0.38ab 27.17 \u00b1\n1.19a \nHis 3.22 \u00b10.17c 4.13 \u00b1\n0.22b 4.42 \u00b1\n0.08ab 4.62 \u00b1\n0.27a 4.54 \u00b1\n0.24ab \nArg 10.27 \u00b10.38a 8.25 \u00b1\n0.56b 8.90 \u00b1\n0.24b 8.96 \u00b1\n0.40b 8.55 \u00b1\n0.55b \nPro 7.76 \u00b10.21c 15.26 \u00b1\n1.03b 17.01 \u00b1\n0.67a 17.47 \u00b1\n0.75a 17.41 \u00b1\n0.73a \nTAA 178.68 289.62 312.93 309.93 320.95 \nAsp: Aspartic acid; Thr: Threonine; Ser: Serine; Glu: Glutamic acid; Gly: Glycine; \nAla: Alanine; Cys: Cysteine; Val: Valine; Met: Methionine; Ile: Isoleucine; Leu: \nLeucine; Tyr: Tyrosine; Phe: Phenylalanine; Lys: Lysine; His: Histidine; Arg: \nArginine; Pro: Proline. \nA-DWPH: Alcalase-DWPH; N-DWPH: Neutrase-DWPH; P-DWPH: Papain-DWPH; \nF-DWPH: Flavourzyme-DWPH.

Wei et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nFood Chemistry: X 22 (2024) 101360\n6correspond to the various secondary protein structures, including \n\u03b1-helix (1645 \u20131662 cm\u00001), \u03b2-sheet (1615 \u20131638 cm\u00001), \u03b2-turn \n(1662 \u20131682 cm\u00001), and random coil (1638 \u20131645 cm\u00001), as reported by \nHou et al. (2017) . Usually, the \u03b1-helix is considered an ordered struc-\nture, and its content is sensitive to conformational changes. The \u03b2-sheet \nand \u03b2-turn structures belong to relatively stretched arrangements that \nenable polypeptide chains to bend and fold upon themselves. The \nrandom coil structure is associated with a disordered arrangement \n(Wang et al., 2021 ). In the present study, the type of enzyme exhibited \nminimal impact on changes in the structure of DWPHs, with only slight \ndifferences in secondary content (P D0.05). The secondary structures of \nthe DWPHs were deconvoluted from the amide I region, and Gaussian \ncurve fitting was used to determine the approximate distribution of the \nsecondary structures, as shown in Table 2. \nThe initial analysis of DM whey protein indicated the presence of \n\u03b1-helix (14.50%), \u03b2-sheet (29.69%), \u03b2-turn (27.75%), and random coils \n(28.06%). Following enzymatic hydrolysis, Neutrase and Flavourzyme \nincreased the proportion of \u03b2-sheet while reducing the \u03b2-turn content, \nwith no significant change in the content of random coils (P F0.05). \nConversely, Alcalase-DWPH and papain-DWPH exhibited a significant \nreduction in \u03b2-sheet content, transforming into \u03b1-helix and random coils \n(P D0.05). This transformation is likely attributed to the unfolding, \ndissociation, and rearrangement of DWPHs during hydrolysis (Wang, \nYang, Fan, Zhang, & Chen, 2019 ). Furthermore, the exposure of hy-\ndrophobic and hydrophilic regions of proteins to new environments, \nalong with cross-linking between formed hydrolysates, leads to changes \nin secondary structure, even the loss or reduction of specific structures \ndue to bond breakage (Meziani et al., 2011 ). Supporting this, a study by \nWang et al. (2023) indicated that the combined proportions of \u03b1-helical \nand \u03b2-sheet structures reflect the compactness of protein structure. \nWhen hydrolysing peanut proteins with different enzymes, they \nobserved a decrease in the proportions of \u03b2-sheet and \u03b2-turn structures, \nalong with an increase in the proportions of random coils in the resulting \nhydrolysates. This conclusion is similar to that of the secondary struc-\ntural changes induced by the hydrolysis of DM whey protein using \npapain. Other proteases show different changes in secondary structures \nowing to their different action sites (Wang et al., 2023 ). In our study, \nAlcalase and papain were found to exert a more pronounced effect on \nthe ordered structure of DM whey proteins, resulting in partial unfolding of the conformation and imparting flexibility and looseness to the hy-\ndrolysate structure. \n3.6. CD analysis \nCD spectroscopy was used to analyse the secondary structures of the \nDWPHs, and the results are shown in Fig. 3B. The CD spectra encompass \ntwo regions: near-UV (245 \u2013320 nm) and far-UV (185 \u2013245 nm). The \npeptide bond absorption peaks were mainly in the far-UV region, where \nthe conformation of the main chain was observed. The CD spectra of \nnative proteins contain a positive peak at 190 nm and a negative peak at \n205\u2013235 nm, which affects the conformation of the main chain (Hou \net al., 2017 ). Generally, the \u03b1-helix of proteins appears near 192 nm in \nthe positive band and has two shoulder peaks at 222 nm and 208 nm in \nthe negative band. \u03b2-sheets appear with a negative peak at 216 nm, \nwhile \u03b2-turns exhibit a positive peak near 206 nm. Fig. 3B. illustrates a \nnegative band at approximately 210 nm, representing the \u03b1-helix \nconformation. A reduction in the negative peak at 210 nm and a blue \nshift of the peak wavelength occurred for the four enzymatic hydroly -\nsates, indicating a loss of \u03b1-helix content, especially for Acalase-DWPH \nwhich has the greatest structural impact (Jiang, Chen, & Xiong, 2009 ). \nThe peak intensities of all the DWPHs varied; however, the intensities of \nNeutrase-DWPH and Flavouryzyme-DWPH were higher than those of \nthe remaining two DWPHs, showing that better results were being \nachieved. This suggests that enzymatic hydrolysis alters the secondary \nstructure of DM whey proteins and has different effects depending on the \ntype of enzyme and site of action. \n3.7. Fluorescence spectra \nAromatic amino acids (especially Trp residues) inside a protein \nmolecule can produce fluorescence, and proteins are usually surrounded \nby multiple nonpolar amino acid residues (Vivian & Callis, 2001 ). As \nshown in Fig. 3C, the overall trend of DWPHs enzymatically cleaved by \nNeutrase and Flavourzyme was consistent with that of DM whey protein. \nHowever, the maximum fluorescence intensities of Neutrase-DWPH and \nFlavourzyme-DWPH showed a higher increase than that of DM whey \nprotein, but less than those of Alcalase-DWPH and papain-DWPH. This \nphenomenon might have been caused by the enzymatic hydrolysis of \n3 kD-4.2 kD-6.5 kD-10 kD-15 kD-20 kD-25 kD-30 kD-1 MWM 2 3 4\n15 kD-25 kD-30 kD-40 kD-50 kD-72 kD-100 kD-130 kD-250kD-MWM\nABFig. 2.The SDS-PAGE profiles of whey protein (A).

Wei et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nFood Chemistry: X 22 (2024) 101360\n7proteins, which exposed the Trp residues to water and increased the \nfluorescence intensity. However, different fluorescence intensities \nresulted because of the varied effects of the enzymatic action. This is similar to the results obtained for antioxidant peptides produced from \nwhey protein (Ma et al., 2023 ). The \u03bbmax of Alcalase, Neutrase, papain, \nand Flavourzyme hydrolysates were 358, 346, 353, and 344 nm, \nrespectively. Notably, the fluorescence emission spectra of all DWPHs \nexhibited a redshift of 9\u201323 nm compared to that of DM whey protein \n(335 nm). Consistent with a prior study (Wang et al., 2021 ), our results \nindicate a redshift in the \u03bbmax of the hydrolysates. Moreover, higher \nfluorescence intensities at \u03bbmax were also observed for these hydroly -\nsates compared to that of DM whey protein, highlighting the positive \nimpact of the four proteases on the hydrolysis of DM whey protein. \nDuring enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins, the unfolding spatial structure \nof the molecule and the exposure of aromatic amino acid residues buried \nin the interior increase the polarity of the environment surrounding the \naromatic amino acids, leading to a redshift in their absorption peak \n(\u03bbmax) (Wang et al., 2021 ). It is noteworthy that changes in enzyme site \nof action, the type of hydrolysates produced, and the exposed amino \nacids can affect the fluorescence peak and \u03bbmax values (Ai et al., 2019 ). \nFig. 3.The FT-IR spectrum of whey protein and DWPHs hydrolysed by different protease.

Surface hydrophobicity \nSurface hydrophobicity is closely related to protein conformation, \nstability, and functional properties and can be used to evaluate changes \nin protein structure. The fluorescence emission spectra of ANS after \nbinding to DM whey protein and DWPHs are shown in Fig. 3D. Surface \nhydrophobicity is related to the emulsification characteristics of pro-\nteins (Ding et al., 2021 ). The highest fluorescence emission spectra \namong the hydrolysates were observed with Flavourzyme, displaying \nthe maximum fluorescence intensity (999.36), followed by Neutrase \n(968.77), while the lowest fluorescence peak was noted for the Alcalase \nhydrolysate (368.92). These peaks serve as indicators of hydrophobic \nstrength, offering insights into the spatial structure and functional \ncharacteristics of proteins. These results indicated that papain-DWPH \nand Alcalase-DWPH reduced the surface hydrophobicity of DM whey \nprotein, whereas Flavourzyme-DWPH and Neutrase-DWPH improved \nsurface hydrophobicity. This aligns with the findings regarding emul -\nsification properties and DH in our study. The decrease in surface hy-\ndrophobicity probably resulted from protease hydrolysis, which \ndestroyed hydrophobic regions and exposed hydrophilic groups, thereby \nimproving the dispersion of the hydrolysate products in water (Wang et al., 2021 ). In parallel studies, the impact of six proteases on the gel \nproperties of preserved egg white gel revealed that hydrolysis products \nof Flavourzyme exhibited a higher likelihood of forming anionic sites \nwith pronounced hydrophobicity compared to other proteases (Ai et al., \n2019 ). In conclusion, Flavourzyme is more suitable for the enzymatic \nhydrolysis of DM whey proteins. \n3.9. FC and FS \nProtein foaming occurs at the liquid/vapour interface. When pro-\nteins dissolve in the aqueous phase, they envelop bubbles by forming a \ncontinuous intermolecular polymer. The stability of foam formed by \nproteins is closely related to protein intermolecular cohesion and elas-\nticity (Tang, Hettiarachchy, Horax, & Eswaranandam, 2003 ). The FCs \nand FSs of DWPHs are shown in Fig. 4A. Flavourzyme-DWPH showed \nsuperior FC than those of other samples (P D0.05). The FCs of Neutrase- \nDWPH and papain-DWPH were similar but much higher than that of \nAlcalase-DWPH (P D0.05). Generally, FC is affected by the diffusion and \ndenaturation rates of proteins at the interface. However, DM whey \nprotein demonstrated better FS, substantially higher than that of its \nhydrolysate. This shift may be attributed to the alteration in the \nFig. 4.FC and FS of whey protein DWPHs hydrolysed by different protease (A). EAI and ESI of whey protein DWPHs hydrolysed by different protease (B). The \nparticle size and PDI of whey protein DWPHs hydrolysed by different protease (C). The DPPH, \u22c5OH and ABTS radical scavenging activity of whey protein and its \nhydrolysates at concentration 2.5 mg/mL (D). For the data of Fig. 4 (A, B, C, D), values were means \u00b1SD (three replicates). M. Wei et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nFood Chemistry: X 22 (2024) 101360\n9conformation of DM whey protein from a compact to a loose structure, \nimpacting its surface hydrophobicity and foaming ability (Zhang et al., \n2019 ). During enzymatic hydrolysis, higher solubility can promote \npeptide \u2013peptide interactions, which lead to the rapid migration of hy-\ndrolysates to the air\u2013water interface and the formation of a wide inter-\nmolecular network, ultimately enhancing FC values (Eckert et al., 2019 ). \nThe higher solubility of Flavourzyme-DWPH, papain-DWPH, and \nNeutrase-DWPH presented a higher FC, a result similar to that of a \nprevious pepsin hydrolysis product study (Eckert et al., 2019 ). The FS \nwas significantly lower for all DWPHs than for DM whey proteins (P D\n0.05), especially for Neutrase-DWPH and papain-DWPH, where the FS \nwas almost negligible. This may be due to the lack of secondary and \ntertiary structures forming cohesive layers around the air droplets. It is \nalso possible that the hydrolysates produced from Neutrase and papain \nare less capable of forming a cohesive layer for stabilising the foam \n(Tang et al., 2003 ). \n3.10. Emulsifying properties \nEAI and ESI are generally used to investigate the emulsifying prop-\nerties of proteins in food. The EAI and ESI of the DWPHs and DM whey \nproteins are shown in Fig. 4B. The EAIs of DWPHs were significantly \nlower than those of the DM whey proteins (P D0.05). This proves that \nprotease hydrolysis can reduce the emulsifying performance of oil\u2013-\nwater systems to a certain extent. This may be because DM whey pro-\nteins are more tightly packed than enzyme hydrolysates and are better \nable to interadsorb oil (Li, Wang, Chen, Sun, & Li, 2019 ). Similar results \nhave been previously reported (Wang et al., 2021 ). Neutrase-DWPH and \nFlavourzyme-DWPH (75.94 \u00b10.34 min and 93.05 \u00b11.45 min, respec -\ntively) exhibited better emulsion stability than that of DM whey protein \n(61.62 \u00b10.20 min) (P D0.05). In contrast, Alcalase-DWPH and papain- \nDWPH showed similar trends in EAI and ESI (P F0.05), both registering \nlower values than DM whey protein (P D0.05). In addition, DH was \nfound to influence EAI and ESI (Klompong, Benjakul, Kantachote, & \nShahidi, 2007 ). The DHs of Neutrase- and Flavourzyme-DWPHs were \nhigher than those of the other DWPHs, and the hydrophobic groups \nwithin the hydrolysates were more exposed, thereby improving their \nemulsification properties. \n3.11. Particle size and PDI \nThe average particle sizes (Fig. 4C) of Alcalase, Neutrase, papain, \nand Flavourzyme hydrolysates were 261.97 \u00b119.67 nm, 214.57 \u00b14.26 \nnm, 243.10 \u00b132.12 nm, and 237.37 \u00b112.25 nm, respectively. The \nparticle size of Neutrase-DWPH and Flavourzyme-DWPH, although not \nsignificantly different from each other (P F0.05), was smaller compared \nto DM whey protein (309.57 \u00b111.32 nm). This observation can be \nattributed to the proteases \u2019 ability to convert whey protein into a rela-\ntively higher number of short peptides or amino acids, particularly \nevident with Neutrase and Flavourzyme, which exhibited lower average \nparticle sizes consistent with their higher DH. \nPDI served as an indicator for assessing the dispersive performance of \nmacromolecular polymers. Lower PDI values for DWPHs indicate better \ndispersibility in water. The hydrolysates and amino acids generated \nafter protein hydrolysis tend to aggregate into fragments or particles \nthrough chemical bonding, thereby exhibiting varied dispersions. \nFig. 4C shows lower PDI values for the DWPHs than for the DM whey \nproteins. This indicated that the dispersion of the protease hydrolysates \nwas superior to those of DM whey protein (0.56 \u00b10.05), especially \nthose of Neutrase-DWPH (0.47 \u00b10.04) and Flavourzyme-DWPH (0.44 \n\u00b10.03), consistent with previous reports (Ding et al., 2021 ). \n3.12. Antioxidant activities of DM whey protein and DWPHs \nGenerally, free radicals are scavenged by binding to hydrogen do-\nnors, causing a change in solution colour. Thus, the antioxidant potential of natural compounds is assessed in terms of their scavenging \nactivity against free radicals (Shimada, Fujikawa, Yahara, & Nakamura, \n2002 ). Fig. 4D shows the DPPH, \u22c5OH, and ABTS radical scavenging ac-\ntivity of DM whey protein and its hydrolysates (2.5 mg/mL). The results \nshowed that the DPPH and \u22c5OH radical scavenging rates of all DWPHs \nwere higher than that of DM whey protein (P D0.05), indicating that \nenzymatic hydrolysis enhances the antioxidant capacity by efficiently \nterminating the free radical chain reaction through electron donation \n(Lorenzo et al., 2018 ). A previous study investigated the antioxidant \nproperties of protein hydrolysates extracted from eggshell membranes \nby lactic acid bacteria and found similar results (Jain & Anal, 2017 ). The \ndifferences in antioxidant activity between DWPHs may be attributed to \nthe number of hydrolysates exposed to side chains produced by varying \nDH (Najafian & Babji, 2015 ). The antioxidant results of Neutase-DWPH \nand Flavourzyme-DWPH determined using the three assay methods \nwere better, especially for Flavourzyme-DWPH. The highest DPPH, \u22c5OH, \nand ABTS radical scavenging activities were found in Flavourzyme- \nDWPH (59.00 \u00b10.58%, 52.97 \u00b11.55%, and 44.50 \u00b10.48%, respec -\ntively; P D0.05). Moreover, DWPHs were more effective in scavenging \nDPPH and \u22c5OH radicals than ABTS. \nThe antioxidant properties can be determined by the scavenging rate \nof free radicals, but also by the reducing ability, chelating capacity of \nmetal ions, etc. The present study is not sufficiently comprehensive in \nterms of only reacting the antioxidant capacity of DM whey protein \nhydrolysates for the free radical clearing ability. Therefore, further \ninvestigation of the comprehensive antioxidant capacity of DWPHs is \nneeded. In addition, Flavourzyme and Neutrase were found to have \nsimilar effects on the structure and some processing properties of DM \nwhey proteins, which might be related to the site of action of the pro-\nteases, and further studies are needed to investigate the mechanism of \ntheir reaction with donkey whey proteins. \n4.Conclusions \nThis study investigated the structural characteristics, processing \ncharacteristics, and antioxidant capacities of DM whey protein hydro -\nlysates prepared using different proteases. According to these results, \nthe enzymatic hydrolysis of DM whey protein improves functional \nproperties, promotes the exposure of hydrophilic groups, reduces par-\nticle size and molecular weight, enriches amino acid content, and in-\ncreases the looseness of the structure. Additionally, antioxidant peptides \nin protein hydrolysates can be used as functional ingredients in food \napplications. It was found that Flavorzyme and Neutrase acted similarly \non DM whey proteins, displaying higher levels of DH, emulsification \ncharacteristics, and smaller particle sizes. However, the deeper changes \nand underlying mechanisms require further exploration. These findings \ncould provide strong support for donkey whey hydrolysates as an anti-\noxidant food additive and suggests a potential application of donkey \nmilk whey hydrolysates as nutritional supplements to improve protein \nabsorption and application. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nChong Ning: Writing \u2013 review & editing, Writing \u2013 original draft, \nValidation, Supervision, Resources, Funding acquisition.
