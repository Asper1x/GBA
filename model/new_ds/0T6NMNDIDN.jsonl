Methods:  This single\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled clinical trial was \nconducted on 81 pregnant women who were at risk of PPD from February to July 2016 at six \nselected health centers in Isfahan, Iran. A  simple random sampling method was adopted. Forty cases \nand 41 controls received 80 mg vitamin B6 and placebo, respectively from the 28th week until the \nend of pregnancy. The risk of PPD was assessed as the main inclusion criteria using a structured \nclinical interview using hospital anxiety\u2011depressive scale (HADS), social support appraisals \nscale (SS\u2011A), and Holmes and Rahe life change and stress evaluation questionnaire (HRLCSEQ). \nThe Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS) was used to assess the rate of depression prior \nto and 1.5 months after the intervention (end of pregnancy). Data were analyzed using SPSS 20 \nand statistical tests (Chi\u2011square, independent t\u2011test, Mann\u2011Whitney\u2019s, and Exact Fisher Test). \nResults:  Forty\u2011three subjects were assigned to each group and the final analysis comprised 81 \nsubjects (40 in the case and 41 in the control groups), the mean age of the case and control groups \nbeing 5.8 \u00b1 29.6 and 4.6 \u00b1 28.2, respectively. The mean depression score was 10.4 \u00b1 1.4 in the case \nand 9.3 \u00b1 4.2 in control groups ( P = 0.34) before and 4.2 \u00b1 2.7 in the case and 10.4 \u00b1 3.4 in control \ngroups ( P < 0.001) after intervention. Conclusions:  Vitamin B6 has a positive effect on reducing \npostpartum depression scores among mothers at risk for PPD. These may be clinically useful for \npreventing PPD in high\u2011risk women.\nKeywords:  Clinical trial, depression, postpartum, primary care, vitamin B6 supplementationCan Vitamin B6 Help to Prevent Postpartum Depression?

The present \nsingle\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled clinical trial was conducted \nto examine the preventive role of vitamin B6 when prescribed \nin the third trimester of pregnancy for cases at risk of PPD.\nMethods\nThis single\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled clinical trial \nwas approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan \nUniversity of Medical Sciences and received the approval code of the Iranian Registry of Clinical \nTrials (IRCT2016091929873N1). The main eligibility was \nbeing a pregnant woman in the third trimester of pregnancy \nwith reasonable physical health and a lack of major \ndepressive disorder. The inclusion criterion was having \nat least one risk factor for PPD (history of psychiatric \ndisorders, marital relationship, antenatal anxiety and \ndepression, absence of depression and clinical anxiety in \npresent pregnancy, lack of social support, recent stressful \nlife events, as well as an unplanned pregnancy).[22] This \ninclusion was based on a structured interview using a \nchecklist of major PPD predictors, hospital anxiety and \ndepression Scale (HADS), social support appraisals \nscale (SS\u2011A), as well as Holmes and Rahe life change and \nstress evaluation questionnaire (HRLCSEQ).\nThe exclusion criteria were developing major depression \nor severe anxiety after being assigned to the study for \nwhich medication or psychotherapy was needed. Moreover, \npregnant women who were unwilling to continue with the \nstudy were excluded. To perform this study, an official \nrecommendation letter was obtained from the Research \nDeputy of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Later, \nthe researchers referred to the midwifery wards of six \nrandomly selected health centers.\nThe participants were selected using a simple random \nsampling technique according to the inclusion criteria Enrollment\nAssessed for eligibility ( n = 140)\nExcluded ( n = 54)\n\u2022 Not meeting inclusion criteria (n = 34)\n\u2022 Declined to participate (n = 10)\n\u2022 Suspect to major depression or\n sever anxiety (n = 10)\nRandomized ( n = 86)\nAllocated to intervention ( n = 43)\n\u2022 Received allocated intervention ( n = 43)\n\u2022 Did not receive allocated\n intervention (n = 0)Allocated to intervention (n = 43)\n\u2022 Received allocated intervention (n = 43)\n\u2022 Did not receive allocate d\n intervention (n = 0)\nLost to follow-up (lack of\ncooperation) ( n = 2)\nDiscontinued intervention ( n = 0)Lost to follow-up (lack ofcooperation) ( n = 2)\nDiscontinued intervention (n = 0)\nAnalysed (n = 41) \n\u2022 Excluded from analysis ( n = 0)Analysed (n = 40) \n\u2022 Excluded from analysis (n = 0)AnalysisFollow-UpAllocation\nDiagram 1: CONSORT 2010 Flow Diagram\nKhodadad, et al.: Vitamin B6 and postpartum depressionInternational Journal of Preventive Medicine 2021, 12: 136 3and were informed about the purpose and method of the \nstudy. The subjects were assured that the information \nwould remain confidential. The consent forms were \nobtained and participants could withdraw at any stage of \nthe project.\nThe case group received two 40 mg pills of vitamin B6 \ndaily from the 28th week to the end of pregnancy and then \none 40 mg pill of vitamin B6 for 1 month after delivery. \nThe control group received two placebo pills daily from the \n28th week to the end of pregnancy and then one placebo \npill for 1 month after delivery. The placebo pill contains \nstarch with a similar shape to the vitamin B6 pill. Every \n2 weeks, the researcher calls on the subjects to remind \nthem of taking pills. All participants who were reluctant to \ncontinue or stop eating the pills were excluded from the \nstudy.\nAccording to the possible delivery date, they were \nreminded of phone calls to continue taking vitamin B6 and \nplacebo one pill per day after childbirth. The follow\u2011up \nwas set for 1.5 months after childbirth concurrently with \nthe first postpartum routine care session in the health \ncenters. Moreover, the PPD questionnaires were completed \nby the participants. Out of 140 eligible pregnant women, \n134 completed the baseline survey questionnaires \n(i.e., HADS, SS\u2011A, and HRLCSEQ) and had a structured \ninterview for the assessment of PPD risk factors (as \nmentioned in inclusion criteria).\nIn addition, a complete psychiatric, medical, and \nmidwifery history, complete physical exams, as well as \nroutine blood tests, including a complete blood count, \nthyroid\u2011stimulating hormone, blood urea nitrogen, \ncreatinine, urinalysis, hemoglobin, and fasting blood \nsugar tests were to be conducted. The Edinburgh \npostnatal depression scale (EPDS) was used to assess \ndepression rates prior to and 1.5 months after the last \nintervention (day of pregnancy) as the primary outcome \nmeasure.\nThe HADS is a self\u2011administered scale consisting of \n14 items with anxiety and depression subscales. This \ninstrument is rated on a four\u2011point Likert scale. To reduce \nthe risk of a false positive bias, the scale does not assess \nthe symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with \nphysical disorder, such as fatigue and insomnia. The HADS \nhas been shown to have adequate diagnostic accuracy. \nIn a recent meta\u2011analysis including diagnostic accuracy \ntests, it was reported that the HADS depression scale had \n82% sensitivity and 74% specificity for detecting major \ndepressive disorder with a score of 8 or more as a cutoff  \nvalue.\nIn addition, the anxiety scale had a sensitivity of 78% \nand a specificity of 74% for detecting generalized \nanxiety disorder.[23] In a psychometric study conducted \nby Montazeri et al . concerning internal consistency using \nCronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient, it was reported that the Iranian version of HADS was considered acceptable. \nCronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients were obtained as 0.78 and \n0.86 for the HADS anxiety and depression subscales, \nrespectively. The validity using known group comparison \nanalysis showed satisfactory results. The cutoff level for \ndetecting depression among the Iranian population was \ndetermined as 11.[24]\nThe SS\u2011A is a 23\u2011item questionnaire, including three \ndomains of family, friends, and others.[25] A Persian \ntranslation of SS\u2011A was used in the present study.[26] The \ncorrelation of the subscales scores with the total score \nwas used to calculate the reliability of this questionnaire. \nCorrelation coefficients were obtained as 0.76, 0.55, and \n0.74 for the total social support score in the family, friends, \nand other subscales, respectively.  P value was considered \nstatistically significant in all subscales (P = 0.0001). The \nreliability (or internal consistency) of this instrument \nwas confirmed by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.77. \nThe cutoff of level 11 was proposed for social support \nscreening.[26]\nThe HRLCSEQ consists of 41 items with a score for any \nitem. The minimum and maximum scores for one item are \n11 and 100, respectively. Maybe a participant had many \nitems. The criterion for the study participants was the total \nscore of more than 150. The subjects with a total score \nhigher than 300 were referred to a psychiatrist. Using \nCronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient and split\u2011half techniques, \nthe reliability coefficient for this tool was calculated as \n0.72 and 0.64, respectively, it shows reasonable reliability \nfor the questionnaire.[27]\nThe EPDS is among the standard instruments with a \nsensitivity of 65%, a specificity of 76.5%, a positive \npredictive value of 62.22%, and a negative predictive value \nof 79.28%. Kheirabadi et al . stated that this tool is useful \nfor Iranian women. According to the aforementioned study, \nmaximum sensitivity and maximum specificities are 78% \nand 75%, respectively. Depression threshold is considered \n13 for Iranian women. This tool can be used in prenatal \nand postpartum periods.[28]\nThe sample size was estimated as 39 for each group \naccording to the sample size calculation formula for \nthe comparison of the two communities, considering a \n95% confidence interval, 80% power, and 20% sample \nattrition.[29] The women who met the inclusion criteria \nwere assigned to case and control groups using a simple \nrandom sampling technique, assigning each sample into \nintervention and control groups alternately.\nAll subjects were blinded to their group assignment and \ncompleted EPDS to assess the baseline depression score. \nThree subjects in the case group and two subjects in the \ncontrol group were excluded according to their own \nrequirements. All cases that remained until the end of the \nEPDS study were completed 6 weeks after delivery. The \nfinal analysis was performed on 81 participants.\nKhodadad, et al.: Vitamin B6 and postpartum depressionInternational Journal of Preventive Medicine 2021 , 12: 136 4Among the cases, 10 women were excluded and referred to \na psychiatrist for probable major depression. In this study, \n86 pregnant women who were diagnosed at risk of PPD \nfrom February to July 2016 participated [Diagram 1].\nData analysis was performed using SPSS \nsoftware (version 20) and statistical tests, namely \nChi\u2011square (occupation, income, unwanted pregnancy, and \nmarriage relationship rating), independent t\u2011test (age, body \nmass index, and child number scoring, and PPD scoring), \nMann\u2011Whitney U test (educational rating), Fisher\u2019s exact \ntest (formerly psychiatric disorder), and covariance analysis \n(ANCOV A) (for variable control).\nResults\nForty\u2011three subjects were randomly assigned to each \ngroup, 40 and 41 subjects in the case and control groups, \nrespectively were cooperated to the end of the study \nand analyzed for the primary outcome. The two groups \nwere not significantly different in terms of demographic \ncharacteristics and midwifery history [Table  1].\nAccording to Table  2, the distribution of risk factors for \nPPD was the same in both groups.\nIndependent  t\u2011test results showed that there was \nno significant difference between the two groups \nregarding the mean score of pre\u2011intervention depression \n(P = 0.34).\nAccording to paired t\u2011test results, it was found that the \nmean score of depression in the post\u2011intervention group \nwas significantly lower than that of the pre\u2011intervention \ngroup ( P < 0.001). In the control group, the mean score \nof depression was not significantly different pre\u2011 and \npost\u2011intervention ( P > 0.05) [ Table  3]. No reportable \ncomplications were observed in both groups.Discussion\nIn this study, there was no significant difference \nbetween the two groups in terms of depression mean \npre\u2011intervention score; however, the mean score of the \ncase group was significantly lower than the control group \npost\u2011intervention.\nNo significant differences were observed regarding PPD \nrisk factors between the case and control groups so that \na significant difference in the post\u2011intervention depression \nscore could be related to the exclusive intervention effect. \nAccording to the obtained results considering the significant \nreduction of PPD score in the intervention group, vitamin \nB6 had a positive effect on decreasing PPD score which is \nconsistent with the findings of the following studies on the \neffect of vitamin B6 on depression symptoms.\nIn a study conducted by Hvas et al. an inverse association \nwas observed between vitamin B6 levels and depression \nsymptoms.[13] Nanri stated that a higher vitamin B6 \nlevel may be associated with a lower risk of depression \nsymptoms in Japanese subjects.[30] Furthermore, a \nsignificant relationship was suggested between vitamin \nB6 with depressive symptomatology in Massachusetts \nelders.[14]\nIn a study conducted by Murakami, it was observed that \nhigher intake of dietary B vitamins, particularly folic \nacid and vitamin B6, were independently associated with \na lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in early \nadolescence.[16] In another study, there was a longitudinal \ncorrelation of vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12 with \ndepression symptoms among older adults.[31]\nThere are some studies of the results which are inconsistent \nwith the findings of the present study in this regard. \nMiyake et al. reported a nonsignificant association between \nTable 1: Comparison of demographic variables between the case and control groups\nTest P Control Group Case Group Variable\nStandard deviation Mean Standard deviation Mean\nIndependent \nt\u2011test0.23 5.8 29.6 4.6 28.2 Age\n0.93 5.2 33.3 5.2 33.2 Husband\u2019s Age\n0.80 2.7 24.9 3.04 25.1 BMI\n0.81 0,8 1.9 1.1 2 Pregnancy Number\n0.12 0.4 1.2 0.9 1.5 Child Number\nP % Number % Number Variable\nEducation\nMann\u2011Whitney \ntest0.36 36.5 15 24.3 9 Below High School\n41.5 17 51.4 19 High School \n22 9 24.3 9 University\nJob\n Chi\u2011square \ntest0.18 92.3 36 82.1 32 Housewife\n7.7 3 17.9 7 Working\nIncome\n0.49 77.5 31 83.8 31 Acceptable\n22.5 9 16.2 6 Unacceptable\nKhodadad, et al.: Vitamin B6 and postpartum depressionInternational Journal of Preventive Medicine 2021, 12: 136 5pyridoxine intake and PPD risk.[32] Personal and family \npsychiatric history and sociocultural factors were not \ncontrolled in this study and these may be the source of \nconfounding factors.\nSanchez reported no significant relationship between \nvitamin B6/B12 intake and depression.[18] In a clinical trial \nconducted by Valentina, no beneficial effects of long\u2011term \nlow\u2011dose supplementation with B vitamins or omega\u20113 \nfatty acids on depression symptoms were shown in \ncardiovascular disease survivors.[33]\nThe metabolite of vitamin B6 pyridoxal 5\u2032\u2011phosphate \nis a cofactor in the tryptophan/serotonin pathway and \nthe synthesis of serotonin and other catecholamines is \ndependent on pyridoxal 5\u2032\u2011phosphate.[11] Depression has \nbeen associated with a deficiency of serotonin and other \ncatecholamines. Vitamin B6 is an essential cofactor for \ntryptophan metabolism and facilitates the conversion \nof tryptophan to the monoamine neurotransmitter and \nserotonin.[34]\nBased on the active role of pyridoxine phosphate \nin neurotransmitter synthesis, vitamin B6 may have \na beneficial role in the prevention and treatment of \ndepression.[30] A limited number of studies investigating \nthe benefit of vitamin B6 supplementation focused on \ndepression as part of premenstrual syndrome.[20] Low\u2011dose \noral contraceptive pills may adversely affect vitamin \nB6 levels and observed depression in plasma pyridoxal \n5\u2032\u2011phosphate concentrations in oral contraceptive pill \nusers may reflect decreased body reserves of vitamin \nB6.[19]\nAccording to a study conducted by a researcher in available \nresources, the effect of vitamin B6 on PPD prevention had \nnot yet been investigated. Perhaps, this study was the first one with this approach. Hence, it is recommended that \nfurther studies need to be conducted to determine how \nvitamin B6 plays a preventive role in PPD. For future \nstudies, taking a blood sample to measure the plasma levels \nof vitamin B6 would be recommended.\nLimitations\nUncontrolled dietary B6 intake and physical activity as \nconfounding variables are the main limitations of this study.\nConclusions\nThe prescription of vitamin B6 may be an effective \npreventive approach towards PPD.\nAcknowledgments\nHereby we thank all pregnant mothers and the managers \nand staff of selected health centers as the field of study \nwho participated in the study patiently.\nDeclaration of patient consent\nThe authors certify that they have obtained consent forms \nfrom all the participants.
