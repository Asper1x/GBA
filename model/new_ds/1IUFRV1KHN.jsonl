The protocol\nfor the systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4202341481). Searches for pertinent\nstudies were carried out on Embase, MEDLINE, Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, and Google\nScholar. The combined effect estimate (Cohen\u2019s d) of the difference in vitamin E levels in malaria\npatients as compared with uninfected individuals was estimated using the random effects model. The\nsearches yielded 2009 records, and 23 studies were included in the systematic review. The majority\nof the studies (80%) found that vitamin E levels were signi\ufb01cantly lower in malaria patients than\nthose who were not infected. Overall, the results revealed a signi\ufb01cant reduction in blood levels\nof vitamin E in malaria patients when compared with uninfected individuals ( p< 0.01, Cohen\u2019s d:\n\u00002.74, 95% CI: \u00003.72\u2013( \u00001.76), I2: 98.69%, 21 studies). There was a signi\ufb01cant reduction in blood\nlevels of vitamin E in patients suffering from severe malaria, in comparison with those experiencing\nless severe forms of the disease ( p< 0.01, Cohen\u2019s d: \u00000.56, 95% CI: \u00000.85\u2013( \u00000.26), I2: 0%, 2 studies),\nbut no variation in blood levels of vitamin E among patients suffering from either P . falciparum or\nP . vivax malaria ( p= 0.13, Cohen\u2019s d: \u00001.15, 95% CI: \u00002.62\u20130.33, I2: 93.22%, 3 studies). In summary,\nthe present study strongly suggests that vitamin E levels are signi\ufb01cantly reduced in malaria patients,\nwith a more pronounced decrease observed in cases of severe malaria. However, the type of malaria\nparasite, speci\ufb01cally P . falciparum orP . vivax , did not appear to in\ufb02uence the levels of vitamin E. This\nstudy highlights the potential role of vitamin E in the pathogenesis of malaria and suggests that\nimproved vitamin E status might be bene\ufb01cial for improving disease outcomes.\nKeywords: malaria; Plasmodium ; antioxidant; vitamin E; tocopherol; systematic review; meta-analysis\n1. Introduction\nMalaria is a protozoan disease caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium\nfalciparum ,Plasmodium ovale ,Plasmodium malariae , orPlasmodium knowlesi through the bite of\nAnopheline mosquitoes [ 1\u20133]. Despite continuing efforts in malaria prevention and control,\nthe disease affects more than 300 million to 500 million people worldwide, particularly\nchildren in Africa. In the year 2021, malaria cases worldwide reached 247 million, with\nan estimated 619,000 malaria deaths [ 3].Plasmodium infection leads to the production of\nfree radicals through oxidative stress, which is one of the pathogenesis mechanisms caused\nbyPlasmodium parasites [ 4,5]. Although the role of oxidative stress in relation to malaria\nremains somewhat elusive, studies have reported an association between the production\nof reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the progression to severe malaria [ 4,6,7]. Therefore,\ncombining antimalarial drugs with antioxidant agents could be a promising approach to\nenhance the ef\ufb01cacy of malaria case management and control strategies.\nNutrients 2023 ,15, 3472. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15153472 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2023 ,15, 3472 2 of 14\nVitamin E, a fat-soluble nutrient, is composed of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols.\nA well-known function of vitamin E is its antioxidant property, which prevents lipid\nperoxidation of the cell membrane [ 8]. In a mouse model, there is evidence to suggest that\nvitamins E and A may possess antimalarial properties [ 9]. Speci\ufb01cally, vitamin E, when\nadministered at the dosage and via the route employed, was effective in preventing anemia\ninduced by P . berghei , as well as in mitigating alterations in both relative organ weight and\nantioxidant status in mice [ 9]. Furthermore, a combination of vitamins C and E has been\nindicated to have potential bene\ufb01ts in ameliorating P . berghei -induced anemia and other\npathological effects in mice [ 10]. On the contrary, a study in a mouse model showed that\nmice with vitamin E de\ufb01ciency in combination with chloroquine signi\ufb01cantly improved\ntheir survival rates when infected with Plasmodium [11]. In addition, P . falciparum was\nreported to use vitamin E to avoid oxidative stress and protect itself from the radicals\ngenerated by antimalarial drugs [ 12]. Studies on HIV-infected Tanzanian women showed\nthat multivitamin supplementation can reduce the risk of presumptively diagnosed clinical\nmalaria and reduce high parasitemia [ 13,14]. Although the relationship between vitamin E\nand its role in malaria pathogenesis is demonstrated through studies conducted both\nin vitro and in vivo , the role of vitamin E in human participants is inconsistent, and the\nconclusion of the relationship was based on studies with a small number of participants.\nAs a result, the current study used systematic review and meta-analysis approaches to\ninvestigate the difference in vitamin E levels between patients infected with Plasmodium\nspecies and those who were not. Furthermore, the difference in vitamin E levels between\ndifferent clinical malaria and Plasmodium species was also investigated. The outcome of this\nstudy will offer necessary insights to direct the potential bene\ufb01t of vitamin E as a vitamin\nsupplementation to patients with malaria in order to manage the disease\u2019s poor outcomes or\nto participants who reside in endemic areas in order to help prevent Plasmodium infection.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Registration, Guidelines for Reporting, and Review Questions\nThe protocol for the systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4202341481).\nThe systematic review and meta-analysis were reported following the PRISMA 2020 state-\nment [ 15]. The systematic review questions followed the population, intervention, com-\nparator(s), and outcomes (PICO) framework [ 16]. P was patients with malaria; I was none;\nC were patients without malaria; and O were vitamin E levels.\n2.2. Eligibility Criteria\nThe eligibility criteria include both the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion\ncriteria were as follows: (i) the study must have reported on vitamin E levels in malaria\npatients and made a comparison with individuals who were not infected with malaria,\n(ii) vitamin E levels must have been measured before the patients underwent any treat-\nment for malaria, and (iii) the study could include any form of vitamin E. The exclusion\ncriteria were animal studies; in vitro studies; studies that do not provide data on vitamin E\nlevels in malaria patients; studies for which the full text is not available; studies involv-\ning patients who received vitamin supplementation prior to the study; studies focusing\nexclusively on severe malaria and vitamin E levels; studies focusing on vitamin E levels in\nconditions other than malaria; studies that include participants that overlap with those in\nanother study; studies in which data on vitamin E levels in malaria patients could not be\nextracted; studies that measured vitamin E levels after malaria treatment; review articles;\nand conference abstracts.\n2.3. Search Strategy\nThe searches were conducted in six databases including Embase, MEDLINE, Ovid,\nPubMed, Scopus, and ProQuest. The synonyms of the search terms \u201cVitamin E\u201d and\n\u201cmalaria\u201d that were used in the search strategy were identi\ufb01ed from Medical Subject\nHeadings (MeSH). The identi\ufb01ed search terms were combined with Boolean operators\nNutrients 2023 ,15, 3472 3 of 14\nsuch as (\u201cVitamin E\u201d OR tocopherols OR alpha-tocopherol OR beta-tocopherol OR gamma-\ntocopherol OR tocotrienols) AND (malaria OR Plasmodium OR \u201cRemittent Fever\u201d OR\n\u201cMarsh Fever\u201d OR paludism). The details of the search strategy in each database are\ndemonstrated in Table S1. The searches were not restricted to the English language or by\npublication dates of the articles. A search was also executed on Google Scholar to discover\npertinent studies not cataloged in the primary databases. The \ufb01nal date for searches in\nmain databases and Google Scholar was 31 March 2023.\n2.4. Study Selection\nAll the articles collected from the databases were transferred into EndNote 20.0 soft-\nware (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). After removing duplicates, studies\nwere screened based on their titles and abstracts for relevance. After irrelevant studies\nwere excluded, the remaining studies\u2019 unabridged texts underwent screening for the \ufb01nal\nselection based on the eligibility criteria. Studies were excluded for a variety of reasons,\nincluding failure to meet the criteria. Two review authors independently conducted the\nscreening and examination of the articles, and any discrepancies in the selection of studies\nwere resolved through discussion.\n2.5. Data Extraction\nThe same two review authors extracted the data from selected studies into the standard\nspreadsheet. Any discrepancies during data extraction were resolved through discussion\nand consensus between the authors. The following information was collected from every\nsingle study: \ufb01rst author\u2019s name, publication year, design of the study, area and continent,\nyear of conduction, study participants (children, adults, pregnant women, or mixed), me-\ndian/mean age, clinical status (asymptomatic, severe, non-severe, or mixed), vitamin E\nlevels (higher or lower between groups), vitamin E levels (mean and standard deviation, me-\ndian and interquartile range), parasite density, methods for malaria detection (microscopy,\nrapid diagnostic test, molecular, or combination), and methods for vitamin E measurement.\n2.6. Quality Assessment\nThe quality of the studies was evaluated utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)\ncritical appraisal tools [ 17]. There were 8 checklists for cross-sectional studies, 10 checklists\nfor case-control studies, and 11 checklists for cohort studies. On the basis of the existence or\nlack of each item on the checklists, the studies were assigned a rating of yes, no, ambiguous,\nor not applicable. The assessment was conducted by the same two review authors, and any\ndifferences were solved through discussion and agreement.\n2.7. Data Synthesis\nThe combined effect estimate (Cohen\u2019s d) with 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (CIs) of\nvitamin E levels between malaria patients and those who were not infected, between those\nwith severe malaria and those experiencing less severe forms of the disease, and between\npatients suffering from P . falciparum malaria and those suffering from P . vivax malaria, was\nestimated using the random effects model as previously described [ 18]. The heterogeneity\nbetween studies was evaluated using the Cochran Q and I2statistics [ 19]. A p-value of less\nthan 0.10 for the Cochran Q test demonstrated signi\ufb01cant heterogeneity [ 20]. In addition,\nlevels of heterogeneity were categorized into <25%, 25\u201375%, and >75%, which indicated\nlow, moderate, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively [21].\nA meta-regression analysis was conducted to assess the potential source of hetero-\ngeneity between the meta-analysis\u2019s included studies. Subgroup analyses were carried out\nto compare the differential effects based on characteristics of studies (publication years,\nstudy design, continent, country), participants ( Plasmodium species, clinical status), the\ndiagnostic test for malaria, and forms of vitamin E. A leave-one-out meta-analysis was\nemployed for the purpose of sensitivity analysis to identify any outlier and measure the\nstatistical validity of the summary meta-analysis [ 22]. The interpretation of a funnel plot\nNutrients 2023 ,15, 3472 4 of 14\nasymmetry [ 23], Egger\u2019s test [ 24], and contoured enhanced funnel plot [ 25] were employed\nto assess publication bias. The meta-analysis was carried out using Stata 17 and Stata 18\n(StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).\n3. Results\n3.1. Search Results\nThe searches yielded 2009 records from ProQuest ( n= 889), Ovid ( n= 338), Embase\n(n= 288), Scopus ( n= 283), MEDLINE ( n= 116), and PubMed ( n= 95). After 1362 nonrelated\nrecords were excluded during the title and abstract screening process, 133 records were\nfurther examined for their full texts against the eligibility criteria. Among those records,\nseventeen records met the eligibility criteria. The remaining studies were excluded based\non the following criteria: animal studies ( n= 54), in vitro studies ( n= 21), reviews ( n= 15),\nno data on vitamin E in malaria ( n= 10), vitamin E in non-malaria ( n= 4), no full text ( n= 4),\nvitamin supplementation ( n= 3), conference abstracts ( n= 1), vitamin E in severe malaria\nonly ( n= 1), studies using overlapping participants ( n= 1), vitamin E after treatment ( n= 1),\nand vitamin E in malaria were unable to be extracted ( n= 1).\nThe searches on Google Scholar identi\ufb01ed 23 potentially relevant studies, and 6 met\nthe eligibility criteria. The following studies were excluded: duplicates with main databases\n(n= 6), those with no information on vitamin E in malaria ( n= 5), those on vitamin E in\nmalaria without an uninfected group ( n= 2), a study for which data were unable to be\nextracted ( n= 1), a study on vitamin E supplementation ( n= 1), a review ( n= 1), and a\nconference abstract ( n= 1). Overall, 23 studies were included in the systematic review and\nmeta-analysis (Figure 1).\nNutrients 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 15 \n \n  \nFigure 1. Study \ufb02ow diagram.  \n3.2.

Vitamin E Levels in Malaria Patients Compared with Those Who Were Not Infected\nOut of 22 studies examining the vitamin E levels in malaria patients compared with\nthose uninfected [ 26\u201347], the majority (18 out of 22 studies, or 81.8%) found that vitamin E\nlevels were signi\ufb01cantly lower in malaria patients [ 26\u201343]. Three studies found no sig-\nni\ufb01cant difference in vitamin E levels between the two groups [ 44\u201346], while one study\nreported increased vitamin E levels in malaria patients compared with those who were not\ninfected [ 47]. One study investigated vitamin E levels in different levels of parasite density\nand found that vitamin E levels increased signi\ufb01cantly as parasite density increased [48].\nThe quantitative synthesis was performed using the quantitative data (mean \u0006SD,\nmedian \u0006IQR) on vitamin E in both malaria patients and those who were not infected\nfrom 21 studies [ 26\u201333,35\u201345,47,48]. The meta-analysis showed decreased vitamin E levels\nin malaria patients when compared with those who were not infected ( p< 0.01, Cohen\u2019s d:\n\u00002.74, 95% CI: \u00003.72\u2013( \u00001.76), I2: 98.69%, 21 studies, Figure 2).\nA meta-regression analysis incorporating variables such as publication year, study\ndesign, the continent where the study was conducted, participants\u2019 group, and the species\nofPlasmodium , clinical status, diagnostic method for malaria, and forms of vitamin E\nshowed that continent, participants\u2019 group, Plasmodium species, and forms of vitamin E\naffected the pooled effect estimate ( p< 0.05) (Table S4). The subgroup analysis indicates\nthat vitamin E levels are generally lower in malaria patients compared with noninfected\nindividuals across different continents, participant groups, and Plasmodium species, with a\nfew exceptions. Speci\ufb01cally, decreased vitamin E levels were observed in malaria patients\nin both Africa and Asia. When considering the participants\u2019 groups, decreased vitamin E\nlevels were noted in studies involving children and adults, but not in studies focusing on\npregnant women. For Plasmodium species, the trend of decreased vitamin E levels was seen\nin studies concerning P . falciparum as well as those involving both P . vivax and P . falciparum .\nHowever, no signi\ufb01cant difference was observed in studies where the Plasmodium species\nwas not speci\ufb01ed. Finally, when analyzing the forms of vitamin E, a decrease was observed\nin studies that did not specify the form of vitamin E, while no signi\ufb01cant difference was\nfound in studies measuring \u000b-tocopherol or total tocopherols (Table 2).\nTable 2.

Difference in Vitamin E Levels between Patients with Severe Malaria and Those Experiencing\nLess Severe Forms of the Disease\nTwo studies reported the quantitative data on vitamin E levels between patients\nwith severe malaria and those experiencing less severe forms of the disease [ 32,44]. A\nstudy showed no difference in the serum vitamin E levels between patients with severe\nmalaria and those experiencing less severe forms of the disease [ 44]. Another study showed\nthat vitamin E levels were signi\ufb01cantly lower in patients with severe malaria than those\nexperiencing less severe forms of the disease [ 32]. Overall, the results revealed a signi\ufb01cant\nreduction in blood levels of vitamin E levels in patients with severe malaria in comparison\nwith those experiencing less severe forms of the disease ( p< 0.01, Cohen\u2019s d: \u00000.56, 95%\nCI:\u00000.85\u2013( \u00000.26), I2: 0%, 2 studies, Figure 3).\nFigure 3.

Discussion\nThe evidence of the systematic review and meta-analysis showed decreased vitamin E\nlevels in malaria patients as compared with the uninfected group. The reduction in vita-\nmin E levels during Plasmodium infection may indicate the reaction of the host\u2019s defensive\nsystem to the production of reactive oxygen species or their metabolites. The decrease\nin vitamin E levels in patients with malaria may indicate an increased requirement, in-\ncreased destruction, or increased utilization of vitamin E during malaria infection [ 43]. The\ntransfer of vitamin E to the membranes of red blood cells to combat the rise in oxidative\nstress during the acute phase of the Plasmodium infection may be the cause of the drop in\nvitamin E levels in malaria patients [ 43]. Furthermore, vitamin E can protect erythrocyte\nmembranes from oxidative stress, as shown by the clinical trial investigating vitamin E\nsupplementation among healthy people [ 49]. The improvement in erythrocyte membrane\n\ufb02uidity and reduction in erythrocyte hemolysis is another proposed mechanism for protec-\nNutrients 2023 ,15, 3472 11 of 14\ntion against Plasmodium infection by vitamin E [ 49]. Vitamin E in combination with other\nantioxidant systems was consumed to counteract the higher levels of oxidative stress, and\nits levels diminished, suggesting the mechanisms of the body can combat or neutralize\nthe effect of oxidative stress during Plasmodium infection. The reduction in ascorbic acid\nor vitamin C levels during Plasmodium infection is one of the proposed mechanisms that\nrelate to the reduction in vitamin E in patients with malaria. Ascorbic acid or vitamin C\nis maintained in its natural form with ascorbate; therefore, ascorbic acid de\ufb01ciency may\nhinder the regeneration of vitamin E and decrease membrane function [ 50]. A negative\nrelationship between serum vitamin E and the reactive lipid metabolite malondialdehyde\nhas been reported, indicating that reduced vitamin E augmented lipid peroxidation and\ncontributed to erythrocyte destruction [ 43]. This evidence supported that vitamin E may act\nas an antioxidant, protecting the cell from oxidative stress caused by Plasmodium infection.\nAlthough most of the included studies showed decreased vitamin E in malaria pa-\ntients compared with those who were not infected, few studies reported the opposite\nresults [32,45] . Between these two studies, one study reported higher plasma levels of\nvitamin E in malaria patients than in those who were not infected. The authors suggested\nthat little vitamin E was consumed during Plasmodium infection [ 32]. Another study also\nreported higher levels of plasma vitamin E in children with P . falciparum malaria, but the\nlevels of vitamin E in erythrocyte membranes were lower than in uninfected controls [ 45].\nThe authors proposed that higher plasma levels of vitamin E during Plasmodium infections\nmight be due to the release of membrane vitamin E caused by acute hemolysis of the\nerythrocytes [45].\nInterestingly, the subgroup meta-analysis of participants enrolled in the included\nstudies showed comparable levels of vitamin E between pregnant women who were\ninfected and those who were not infected with malaria. This result was suggested to\nbe explained by the fact that pregnant women showed a hyperlipidemic state during\npregnancy, and vitamin E was also increased in this state as it is a fat-soluble vitamin [ 51].\nIn addition, it is probable that the enhancement of vitamin E dominates its use as an\nantioxidant defense molecule [ 46]. Another explanation was that the majority of pregnant\nwomen had asymptomatic infections, which might result in them exhibiting lower oxidative\nstress levels than those with symptomatic infections. Hence, a small amount of vitamin E\nmay be diminished or non-signi\ufb01cantly lower in pregnant women.\nThere were inconsistencies regarding the difference in vitamin E levels among patients\nsuffering from either P . falciparum orP . vivax malaria. Three studies reported vitamin E\nlevels among patients suffering from either P . falciparum orP . vivax malaria [ 37,41,43]. One\nstudy showed that vitamin E levels were signi\ufb01cantly decreased in P . falciparum malaria\nas compared with P . vivax malaria [ 37]. Similarly, the other two studies showed lower\nmean vitamin E levels in P . falciparum malaria as compared with P . vivax malaria [ 41,43].\nIt has been suggested that P . falciparum infection led to more oxidative stress than P . vivax\ninfection [ 43]. A previous study showed higher levels of lipid peroxides in patients with\nP . falciparum infections as compared with those with P . vivax infections. Therefore, a higher\namount of vitamin E may be used to counteract high oxidative levels, which lower the\nlevels of blood vitamin E. Additional investigations are required to con\ufb01rm the difference\nin vitamin E levels between P . falciparum and P . vivax infections. Furthermore, due to\nthe increased oxidative stress and reduction in antioxidant vitamin E during Plasmodium\ninfection, antioxidant vitamin E supplementation or foods rich in vitamin E are being\nrecommended for the management of patients with malaria.\nThere was little information regarding the association between vitamin E levels and\nparasite density. Three studies reported that vitamin E levels increased signi\ufb01cantly as\nmalaria density increased [ 39,40,48]. This association suggested that patients with an\nincreased number of parasites might be more susceptible to higher levels of oxidative stress.\nNevertheless, the positive association between vitamin E levels and parasite density raised\nthe question about the role of vitamin E in different parasite densities as the meta-analysis\nresults showed decreasing vitamin E levels in participants who were infected with malaria.\nNutrients 2023 ,15, 3472 12 of 14\nAs the information on the association was limited by those three studies, future studies with\na higher number of malaria cases are needed to con\ufb01rm the direction of this relationship.\nThere was also little information regarding the association between vitamin E levels and\nseverity levels of malaria. Based on the two studies that reported vitamin E levels among\npatients with severe malaria in comparison with those experiencing less severe forms of\nthe disease [ 32,44], there was inconsistency regarding the vitamin E levels among various\nlevels of malaria severity. Despite the meta-analysis indicating a considerable reduction in\nblood levels of vitamin E in patients with severe malaria in comparison with those with less\nsevere disease, the results of an individual study showed lower vitamin E levels in severe\nmalaria as compared with non-severe malaria [ 32], but a signi\ufb01cant difference was not\nfound by another study [ 44]. The inconsistency in the results between studies might re\ufb02ect\nthe differences in nutritional status and diet between the different studies\u2019 locations [44].\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis included limitations. First, the meta-\nanalysis\u2019s heterogeneity remained in the results of the present study. Second, the publication\nbias in the meta-analysis might affect the conclusions made in this study. A small number\nof studies that examined the relationship between vitamin E among patients with varying\nlevels of clinical severity and different species of Plasmodium causing malaria were incorpo-\nrated in the analysis. Hence, more studies are needed to investigate the con\ufb01dence of the\nmeta-analysis \ufb01ndings.\n5. Conclusions\nThe \ufb01ndings of the systematic review and meta-analysis strongly suggest that vita-\nmin E levels are signi\ufb01cantly reduced in malaria patients, with a more pronounced decrease\nobserved in cases of severe malaria. However, the type of malaria parasite, speci\ufb01cally\nP . falciparum orP . vivax , did not appear to in\ufb02uence the levels of vitamin E. The present\nstudy highlights the signi\ufb01cant reduction in vitamin E levels that may be related to the\npathogenesis of malaria and suggests that improved vitamin E status might be bene\ufb01cial\nfor improving disease outcomes.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.\nmdpi.com/article/10.3390/nu15153472/s1: Table S1: Search terms; Table S2: Details of the included\nstudies; Table S3: Quality of included studies; Table S4: Meta-regression results; Figure S1: Malaria\nvs. uninfected controls_confunnel.\nAuthor Contributions: M.K., K.U.K. and A.M. designed the study.
