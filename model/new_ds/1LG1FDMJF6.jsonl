The presentstudy investigated the effect of the aphrodisiac Tribulus terrestris on the GDF9 and BMP15\nexpression in the oocytes and cumulus cells at mRNA and protein levels during folliculogen-esis in two generations of female rabbits. The experiment was conducted with 28 New Zea-\nland rabbits. Only the diet of the experimental mothers group was supplemented with a dry\nextract of T.terrestris for the 45 days prior to insemination. The expression of BMP15 and\nGDF9 genes in the oocytes and cumulus cells of mothers and F1 female offspring was ana-lyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The localization of the GDF9and BMP15 proteins in the ovary tissues was determined by immunohistochemical analy-sis. The BMP15 and GDF9 transcripts were detected in the oocytes and cumulus cells ofrabbits from all groups. T.terrestris caused a decrease in the BMP15 mRNA level in the\noocytes and an increase in the cumulus cells. The GDF9 mRNA level increased significantly\nin both oocytes and cumulus cells. The downregulated expression of BMP15 in the treated\nmothers \u2019oocytes was inherited in the F1 female offspring born to treated mothers. BMP15\nand GDF9 show a clearly expressed sensitivity to the bioactive compounds of T.terrestris .\nIntroduction\nThe plant, Tribulus terrestris (TT), is used in the industrial production of medical preparations\nand feed additives based on its saponin fraction [ 1]. The dry extract of TTis extremely rich in\nsubstances having potential biological significance, such as flavonoids, alkaloids [ 2], glycosides,\nand phytosteroids [ 3\u20135]. Since ancient times, T.terrestris is known as an aphrodisiac herb with\nstimulating effects on the androgenic metabolism in humans and male animals [ 6\u201311].

Oral treatment of aqueous extracts of TTincreases the number of growing\nfollicles in mice, but without significant effect on the sex hormone levels [ 13]. The increase in\negg production in Guinea fowls treated with TTextract report [ 14]. [15] showed higher num-\nbers of yellow bodies in the ovaries of treated immature rats as an evidence of LH-like activity\nofTT, causing puberty onset. Moreover, TTwas suggested as an alternative treatment for poly-\ncystic ovary disease. A high dose of the extract can efficiently remove ovarian cysts and resumeovarian activity [ 16\u201317]. It seems that TTaffects folliculogenesis in females; however, limited\ninformation is available in this regard and the mechanisms underlying the action of TTremain\nunknown.\nIt is well known that two oocyte-specific genes, growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and\nbone morphogeneticprotein 15 (BMP15), play a key role in the regulation of folliculogenesis in\nmany species. These factors induce the proliferation and differentiation of the follicular cellsduring follicular development from the primordial stage [ 18\u201319]. In addition, they are involved\nin the final events of maturation and ovulation, such as cumulus cell expansion and yellow\nbody formation [ 20\u201322]. For efficient female fertility, a precisely balanced level of BMP15 and\nGDF9 expression in oocytes is required [ 23]. These processes are controlled and coordinated\nby mutually dependent actions between oocytes and cumulus cells [ 24]. Evidence of the impor-\ntance of BMP15 and GDF9 in female fertility was obtained through experiments with knockout\nand transgenic animals [ 25\u201327], analyses of the gene mutations in ewes and humans [ 28\u201331],\nas well as through in vitro experiments with oocytes-cumulus complexes [ 32\u201334]. However,\nthere is a lack of knowledge on how external factors affect the expression of these oocyte-\nderived growth factors, particularly the nutritional factors that animals are exposed to duringfolliculogenesis.\nThere are only few in vivo studies available in this field. A previous study [ 35], showed that\na 40% calorie restriction in mice led to a decline in the expression of GDF9 in the ovaries; how-ever, a contrasting data was provided by another study [ 36]: no differences were observed in\nthe GDF9 and BMP15 mRNA levels in the oocytes of ewes exposed to the high and low energy\ndiets for two weeks before superovulation. In rabbits, a previous study [ 37] examined the effect\nof moderate and severe dietary feed restriction (21 days), followed by refeeding (8 days), onGDF-9 gene expression in mature and immature oocytes. They established an enhanced per-\ncentage of mature oocytes, accompanied by a significant increase in GDF-9-mRNA levels in\noocytes after refeeding. In contrast, another study [ 38] did not observe any change in the\nmRNA levels of GDF9 and BMP15 from whole ovaries of rabbits fed on a high fat, high choles-\nterol diet.\nConsidering the pivotal role of the paracrine factors GDF9 and BMP15 in folliculogenesis\nfrom the primordial stage until ovulation, we hypothesize that the biological active compounds\nofTTaffect their expression through metabolic pathways. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to\nevaluate the growth factors, GDF9 and BMP15, at mRNA and protein levels to determine: a)how TTaffects folliculogenesis and ovulation rates in rabbit-mothers and b) how TTimpacts\nthe ovaries of F1 female offspring born to the treated mothers.\nMaterials and Methods\nExperimental design for animals\nThe investigations were conducted with 28 female white New Zealand rabbits in the animal\nfacility of the Institute of Biology and Immunology of Reproduction, Sofia, Bulgaria. The\nexperiment started with 14 sexually mature does (mothers generation) randomly divided in the\ncontrol and experimental groups of 7 females each. The animals from the experimental group\nTribulus terrestris and BMP15 and GDF9 in Rabbit Ovary\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150400 February 29, 2016 2/1 7\nwere individually provided the feed additive, VemoHerb-T (VHT, producer Vemo-Ltd, Bul-\ngaria), with their drinking water, in daily doses of 3.5 mg/kg body weight for 45 days prior to\ninsemination. The VHT preparation contained a dry extract of Tribulus terrestris with the fol-\nlowing active substances: 60% furostanol saponins, determined as protodioscin; flavonoids \u2014\n10.0%; tannic compounds \u2014tannin \u201410.0%. Both groups were fed with standard diet for\nmature rabbits. At the end of the experimental period, female rabbits from both groups were\nmated with one control male rabbit. The number and survivability of offspring were estimated.The animals from the parental generation were slaughtered, after weaning of the offspring, for\novary collection.\nAmong the female newborns (F1 female generation), two new groups were formed, control\nand experimental, of 7 females each to the origin from the mothers \u2019generation. The animals\nwere fed standard diet and kept in the same conditions as the mothers \u2019generation, but without\nVHT additive, until puberty onset (6 months old) and were slaughtered thereafter for ovarycollection.\nAll animals were reared and handled in accordance with the Bulgarian Veterinary Law (25/\n01/2011), in terms of the life conditions and welfare of experimental animals, adapted to theEuropean Union regulation 86/609. In accordance with the Bulgarian Veterinary Law (Regula-tion N20 /01.11.2012 based on the Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for\nscientific purposes in the Member States), only the National Ethics commission for animals\ncan approve the use of animas for scientific purposes. The present study is one of the plannedinstitutional projects for the period 2013 \u20132018 and its protocol has been approved by the\nNational Ethics commission for animals within the delivered permission of use of the animals\nin the experiments\" (N84/04.10.2013, expiry date 04.10.2018). The responsible person for ani-mal welfare at the Institute, working directly with the animals, is licensed by Bulgarian veteri-\nnary services for animal experimentation. The slaughtering of animals was performed after\npreviously anesthetizing with 2% xylazine. All efforts were made to minimize suffering.\nSample collection\nOvaries removed from the slaughtered animals were kept in PBS and brought to the laboratoryimmediately. One ovary from each animal was used for the collection of oocytes and cumuluscells. The cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated by puncturing the follicles (diam-\neter/C212 mm) and collected under the stereomicroscope SMZ-10 (Nikon, Japan). Firmly com-\npacted COCs with multilayered cumulus cells and a uniformly granulated cytoplasm wereseparated into oocytes and cumulus cells by repeated aspiration using a narrow-bore Pasteur\npipette. Final denudation of the oocytes was performed by hyaluronidase treatment (Sigma-\nAldrich; at a working concentration of 300 \u03bcg/mL), followed by washing thrice in PBS. The col-\nlected samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until RNA extraction.\nExtraction and Purification of Total RNA and First-strand cDNA\nSynthesis\nTotal RNA was isolated from cumulus cells and oocytes separately for each animal, using a\ncommercial RNA purification kit (NORGEN, 17200, Canada). A 1- \u03bcL volume of the solution\nwas used for a concentration test and examination of the RNA integrity with a Qubit RNA\nAssay Kit (Invitrogen, Q32852). The extracted RNA was kept at \u201370\u00b0C.\nThe first strand of cDNAs was synthesized by the kit \u201cEasy Script Plus Reverse Transcripta-\nse\u201c(G177, abm, Canada), according to the manufacturer \u2019s instructions using the oligo dT and\nrandom primers mix included in the kit.\nTribulus terrestris and BMP15 and GDF9 in Rabbit Ovary\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150400 February 29, 2016 3/1 7\nReal Time PCR\nThe analysis of the GDF9 and BMP15 gene expressions in oocytes and cumulus cells was per-\nformed by RT-PCR using two sets of primers, GDF9-forward primer: 50-AAAGACCAGCTGC\nAGCATCC -30and reverse primer: 50-TGGTGTGAACTGGAGAGCCA -30; BMP15-forward\nprimer: 50-GCTGGGATCACTGGATCATT -30and reverse primer: 50-TGTACAGGACTGGGC\nAATCA -30. All primers were commercially synthesized (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).\nPCR amplification was performed under the following conditions: predenaturation at 95\u00b0C\nfor 10 min; 40 cycles for each sample that comprised an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 5 s,\nannealing at 60\u00b0C for 20 s, and extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. Rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase (GAPDH- forward primer: AAGGTCATCCACGACCACTT; GAPDH- reverseprimer: AGGCCATGCCAGTGAGT; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as a control gene for PCR.At the same time, negative controls (without cDNA template), with cDNA substituted for water,\nwere set up for comparison. Each sample was run in triplicate. The cycle threshold values (CT)\nindicated the quantity of the target gene in each sample and the sequence of the target gene wasdetermined in realtime using an Mx3005P QPCR system (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA, USA).\nIn order to correct the inter-run fluctuations, standard curves were generated for each gene\nby serial dilution of the mix cDNA samples (1, 1:5, 1:25, 1:125, 1:625, and 1:3125). A 2- \u03bcL vol-\nume of each concentration was used as a sample separately for the construction of GDF9,\nBMP15, and GAPDH gene standard curves.\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe second ovary of each animal was fixed with 10% formaldehyde PBS and subsequently\ndehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections of 5- \u03bcm thickness were cut by using a\nmicrotome type 2125RT (Leica GmbH, Germany). The histological estimation of the folliculo-\ngenesis was done by counting the number of the different classes of follicles per \u03bcm.\nFor the detection and analysis of GDF9 and BMP15 proteins, the immunohistochemical\ntechnique described by [ 39] was performed using commercial antibodies. Simultaneously,\nimmunohistochemical-negative controls were carried out using an irrelevant IgG. Briefly, sec-\ntions were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min and kept in 10% donkey serum for 1h at room temperature. The primary antibodies goat polyclonal anti-human, in working dilu-\ntion GDF-9 1:100 or BMP15 1:100 (GDF9, code sc-12244; BMP15, code sc- 18337, Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.) were used for incubation over night at 4\u00b0C. Theprimary antibody reaction was achieved using donkey anti-goat biotinylated secondary anti-bodies in a working dilution of 1:200 (code sc-2023) for 1 h, followed by avidin-biotin complex\n(1:1000; code PK-6100, Vector, USA) for 1 h. Finally, the binding was visualized by the addi-\ntion of 3,3\n0-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen solution (1:200; code SK-4105, Vector, USA)\nfor 10 min. After counterstaining with hematoxylin (Vecto, USA), the sections were observed\nwith an Olympus BX51 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and images were taken with a Powershot G6,\n7.1 megapixels digital camera (Canon Inc., Japan).\nStatistical Analysis\nDepending on the sample number and normality of distribution, parametric and non-paramet-ric statistics were used. For n >30 and normal distributions, Student \u2019st-test was applied. In all\nother cases, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to estimate the significance of results.\nThe data from PCR were developed by DataAssist Sft. (Ver. 3. 01, Applied Biosystems)\nusing the \u0394Ct method [ 40]. The quantifying results of copy numbers of BMP15 and GDF9\nmRNA were expressed as a mean of the ratio of target genes to the control gene \u2014GAPDH. For\nthe evaluation of the feed additive effect, the \u0394\u0394Ct method was applied for the comparison\nTribulus terrestris and BMP15 and GDF9 in Rabbit Ovary\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150400 February 29, 2016 4/1 7\nbetween the control and the experimental groups [ 40]. The fold change (FC) against the con-\ntrol group /C212 and pvalue /C200.05 were considered as an up-regulation; FC /C200.5 and p/C200.05\nwere considered as downregulation. Genes with a FC between 0.5 and 2 were considered toindicate no significant change.\nThe immunostaining reaction was evaluated on representative fields of the ovary slices.\nImmunoreactivity of GDF9 and BMP15 was assessed as a percent of the staining intensity of\nthe positive cells inside a defined area ( \u03bcm\n2), using the software program ImageJ. A t-test was\nused to compare the results between control and experimental groups. Statistical significance\nwas set at p <0.05.\nResults\nSupplementation of VHT in the rabbit mothers \u2019diet led to an increase in ovary weight in both\ngenerations of female rabbits. VHT did not affect fertility; the number of offspring born was\nsimilar to that of the control group ( S1 Table ). However, the survivability of newborns of\ntreated mothers was higher than that of the control group ( S1 Fig ). The density of the primary\nand secondary follicles in the ovaries of the treated mothers \u2019generation and the density of the\npreantral follicles in the ovaries of F1 females born to the treated mothers were higher than\nthose in the controls ( S2 Table ).\nIn the oocytes and cumulus cells collected from all does, both BMP15 and GDF9 transcripts\nwere detected. There were the differences in the expression of the investigated genes between\ngenerations. BMP15 and GDF9 expression in the oocytes of control F1 females \u2019ovaries was\nhigher than that in the control mothers \u2019ovaries ( Fig 1A ). A remarkable difference was\nobserved in the expression of GDF9; the mRNA level of GDF9 in the oocytes of the F1 genera-\ntions \u2019ovaries was several times higher than those in the mothers \u2019ovaries. In contrast, the\nexpression of BMP15 and GDF9 in the cumulus cells of rabbit-mothers \u2019ovaries and F1 females\nwas not significantly different ( Fig 1B ).\nSupplementation of the rabbit-mothers \u2019diet with the feed additive VHT led to a decrease in\nthe BMP15 mRNA level in the oocytes and an increase in its level in the cumulus cells ( Fig\n2A). The significant increase in GDF9 mRNA levels in both oocytes and cumulus cells was\nobserved in the ovary of mothers treated with VHT ( Fig 2C ).\nFig 1. mRNA level of GDF9 and BMP15 in the oocytes (A) and cumulus cells (B) of the female rabbits in dependence on age. The results were\nobtained by comparison of the control groups from both generations \u2013does-mothers and F1 female offspring. Total RNA was extracted from the oocytes and\ncumulus cells and subjected to real-time PCR to determine the mRNA levels of BMP15 and GDF9. The expression of these mRNAs was normalized to the\nexpression of control gene GAPDH. The triplicates for each reaction were averaged. This data represent the mean \u00b1SEM of the combined results from the\nanalysis of seven rabbits from each group ( *,P<0.05). The significantly higher expression of BMP15 and GDF9 in the oocytes from the ovaries of F1 female\ncompared to the mothers' generation was observed.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0150400.g001\nTribulus terrestris and BMP15 and GDF9 in Rabbit Ovary\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150400 February 29, 2016 5/1 7\nThe expression level of mRNA in the investigated genes was lower in both oocytes and\ncumulus cells in the ovaries of F1 females \u2019offspring born to experimental mothers compared\nto the F1 females born to the controls ( Fig 2B and 2D ). We noticed down-regulation of\nBMP15 in oocytes of the offspring (FC = 0.12, P <0.05) and GDF9 in cumulus cells\n(FC = 0.25, P <0.05).\nThe direct effect of the VHT supplementation on the expression of BMP15 and GDF9 genes\nin the oocytes and cumulus cells of the treated mothers was several times higher than that inthe F1 female offspring born to them ( Table 1 ).\nBoth the investigated genes demonstrated sensitivity to VHT treatment. However, a more\npowerful impact of VHT on the GDF9 gene expression in the cumulus cells of mothers \u2019ovaries\nwas observed.\nFig 2. Effect of the VHT supplementation of rabbit mothers \u2019diet on the expression of BMP15 and GDF9 mRNA levels in the oocytes and cumulus\ncells of two generations. (A) and (C) mothers \u2019generation; (B) and (D) F1 female generation. The only experimental group of the mothers \u2019generation was\ntreated with feed additive VemoHerb-T (dry extract of plant Tribulus terrestris , producer Vemo-Ltd) during 45 days prior to insemination. Total RNA was\nextracted from the oocytes and cumulus cells and subjected to real-time PCR to determine the mRNA levels of BMP15 and GDF9. The expression of these\nmRNAs was normalized to the expression of control gene GAPDH. Data are shown as a relative ratio (fold change \u2014FC) of the mRNA level of these genes in\nthe experimental groups to the controls of each generation. These data represent the mean \u00b1SEM of the combined results from the analysis of seven rabbits\nfrom each group ( *- significance P <0.05, compared to control). T.terrestris caused a decrease in the BMP15 mRNA level in the oocytes and an increase in\nthe cumulus cells. The GDF9 mRNA level increased significantly in both oocytes and cumulus cells. The downregulated expression of BMP15 in the treate d\nmothers \u2019oocytes was inherited in the F1 female offspring born to treated mothers.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0150400.g002\nTribulus terrestris and BMP15 and GDF9 in Rabbit Ovary\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150400 February 29, 2016 6/1 7\nThe localization of BMP15 and GDF9 proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry.\nImmunopositive signals of BMP15 and GDF9 were detected in the oocytes and cumulus\ncells of the follicles in the ovaries of mothers and F1 females \u2019(Figs3and4) from both groups,\ncontrol and experimental. In addition, both growth factors were detected in the theca, intersti-tial, and corpus lutein cells.\nThe computer estimated immune staining intensity of the investigated proteins had shown\nthe most intensive signals of BMP15 ( Fig 5 ) and GDF9 ( Fig 6 ) in the oocytes from primordial\nand primary follicles and the lowest in the oocytes from antral follicles in all groups. Signifi-cantly higher signals for both proteins were observed in the primary and secondary oocytes\nfrom ovaries of the mothers treated with VHT. The increased secretion of GDF9 in the oocytes\nfrom antral follicles of treated mothers \u2019ovaries corresponded with the results of mRNA level\nchanges obtained by PCR, whereas the results related to the BMP15 signals in the oocytes are\nsomewhat contradictory. Although the level of BMP15 mRNA in the oocytes of treated moth-\ners decreased, there were no differences in the intensity of protein signals compared to the con-trol oocytes. It is likely that a reverse of the protein BMP15 from cumulus cells to oocytes\noccurred due to a deficit in mRNA production in the oocytes. Thus, the BMP15 protein expres-\nsion was significantly higher in the cumulus cells of the antral follicles in both experimentalgroups F0 mothers and F1 female offspring generations ( Fig 5 ).\nIn the cumulus cells, the intensity of BMP15 and GDF9 signals increased from primary to\nsecondary and preantral follicles and decreased again to antral follicles. The more intenseGDF9-signals were detected in the cumulus cells from the secondary follicles of the treatedmothers ( Fig 6 ).\nDiscussion\nPrevious studies have shown that GDF9 and BMP15 have distinct effects on the reproductive\nphysiology in a species-specific manner [ 41]. Considering this, it is very important to collect\ndata on BMP15 and GDF9 actions in the ovaries of different animal species. To our knowledge,\nour study was the first in vivo study describing the changes in the expression of the growth fac-\ntors BMP15 and GDF9 at mRNA and protein level in the follicular structures of female rabbits\nin two generations \u2013mothers and F1 female offspring \u2013as a result of supplementation of dry\nextract of T.terrestris to mothers \u2019diet 45 days prior to insemination. The obtained data dem-\nonstrated the clearly expressed sensitivity of the BMP15 and GDF9 to the bioactive compoundsofT.terrestris .\nT.terrestris is one of the most popular phyto-aphrodisiac for male reproduction. Although\nthe long-term use of this plant improves sexual performance in males, there is no consensus onthe exact mechanisms of TTaction in the organism. It is believed that steroidal saponins pres-\nent in TTextracts can enhance the endogenous androgen production by increasing luteinizing\nhormone release from the pituitary gland [ 42]. Another hypothesis proposes that TTbioactiveTable 1.

The potential application of TTas an alternative therapy for the sexual dys-\nfunction in women [ 12] as well as the evidence of its ability to remove ovarian cysts [ 16] has\nled to increased research on this plant focusing on female reproduction.\nOur results show the stimulating effect of the additive VemoHerb-T on the weight of rabbit\nmothers \u2019ovary and weight of the offspring. Similar results were observed in mice [ 13] and in\nGuinea fowls [ 14] treated with the extract of TT. Moreover, the treated mother does in our\nexperiment expressed more pronounced maternal instincts than the controls. They more\nactively prepared the nests and took thorough care of the pups. The Kaplan-Meier analysisconfirmed a higher survivability of newborns to experimental mothers. Considering that such\nmaternal behavioral reactions are related to the action of estrogens on the central nervous sys-\ntem [ 44], our results indicate an enhanced level of estrogens in the ovary of treated mothers.\nOur results are consistent with a previous study [ 42], which demonstrates an increase in the\nluteinizing hormone level in female rats treated with TT. The LH-like effect of T.terrestris on\nrats\u2019ovaries has been demonstrated in a previous study [ 15]. It is known that LH can stimulate\nFig 3.

An\nenhanced level of estradiol was reported in women who used the preparation Tribestan (pills\ncontaining the dry extract of TT); despite the suppression of FSH production, the secretion of\nestradiol and progesterone did not decrease in women treated with Tribestan [ 46].\nHowever, it is impossible to explain all morphological changes in the ovaries of experimen-\ntal animals, particularly the increase in the density of secondary follicles, by the hormonal\nchanges only, because at this stage they are not sensitive to hormones. Similar to the presentstudy, an enhanced number of secondary follicles in the ovaries of TTtreated rat was found in\na previous study [ 15]. These results can be explained on the basis of our data, which demon-\nstrated the changes in the expression of growth factors BMP15 and GDF9 in the oocytes andcumulus cells under TTtreatment.\nCurrently existing literature related to rodents mainly provides information on the expres-\nsion of GDF9 and BMP15 genes in the oocytes [ 47,26]. In our in vivo experiments, we estab-\nlished new insights that the transcripts of BMP15 and GDF9 were detected in both oocytes and\ncumulus cells in the ovaries of all adult and young rabbits.

Similar results were obtained during the investigation of gene\nprofiles in the oocytes from young and adult mice [ 49,35]. Our results confirmed the findings\nof a previous study [ 50] that GDF9 expression is higher in the oocytes of young calves than in\nadult cows. However, our results differ from the results of that study [ 50] in terms of age-asso-\nciated BMP15 expression in bovine oocytes and cumulus cells.\nWe established the presence of BMP15 and GDF9 proteins in the follicles at all stages of\ndevelopment as well as in the interstitial and corpus lutein cells, which strongly suggest theirpivotal role in the whole process of folliculogenesis in rabbits and confirms the previous inves-\ntigations in other rodents [ 27,32].\nIn the present study, the alteration in the expression of the BMP15 and GDF9 genes, as a\nresult of the supplementation of feed additive VHT to the mothers \u2019diet, indicated their high\nsensitivity to metabolic changes in the ovaries. These findings are consistent with those of pre-\nvious studies [ 35,37], in which the calorie restriction in mice, as well as the feed restriction and\nrefeeding in rabbits lead to changes in GDF9 expression in the ovaries. In our study, T.terres-\ntriscaused the alteration of mRNA levels of both genes, but in different ways. Although we\nnoticed a downregulation of BMP15 in the oocytes of treated mothers, we did not observe anyfailure in their fertility. This corresponds with the conclusion of [ 32] that in rodents, BMP15 is\nonly partially required for ovulation and fertilization. Nevertheless, the observed increase in\nBMP15 mRNA level in the cumulus cells possibly compensates the lack of BMP15 expression\nin the oocytes.\nAdditionally, we found a significant upregulation of the GDF9 gene in the oocytes and\ncumulus cells of treated mothers. GDF9 is the closest homolog to BMP15 (known as GDF9B).\nBoth bind to the same type II receptor, BMPRIIB, which is essential for GDF9/BMP15 signal-ing in granulosa cells [ 51,19] and show synergism or have similar activity during folliculogen-\nesis [ 52]. Moreover, GDF9 supports embryo development and fetal viability [ 53]. It is likely\nthat these biological functions of GDF9 facilitated increased fertility in our experimental ani-mals, despite the decreased level of BMP15 mRNA in the oocytes.\nThe morphological changes in the treated rabbits \u2019ovaries followed the changes in the\nexpression of growth factors. There is substantial evidence in several mammalian species that\nGDF9 is essential for the early stages of follicle development [ 52]. The increased level of GDF9\nin our study ensured a more active involvement of the ovarian reserve in the development. We\nobserved a higher density of primary and secondary follicles in the ovary of the mothers treated\nwith TT. In addition, the diameter of secondary and preantral follicles was higher than that in\ncontrols (unpublished data). This is likely due to the ability of GDF9 to regulate granulosa cell\nmitosis through both, Smad-dependent and independent signaling pathways [ 54].\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that T.terrestris causes a significant\nincrease in GDF9 at the mRNA and protein levels in the oocytes and cumulus cells of rabbits.\nThese results provide additional value to the explanation of the therapeutic effect of TT\ndescribed in previous studies [ 12,16] in females, because the lack of GDF9 leads to several\ntypes of ovarian disorders. It was reported that ovaries from 25- to 31-week-old female GDF9null mice contain either single unilateral or bilateral ovarian follicular cysts, lined by several\nlayers of flattened granulosa cells [ 25]. In addition, research on ovary tissues from women with\npolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) revealed that GDF9 mRNA expression is substantiallydelayed and reduced during the growth and differentiation phase [ 55] and cannot reach the\nnormal level even after ovarian stimulation, which is the premise for impaired oocyte quality\nand developmental competence in PCOS females [ 56]. The increased level of GDF9 mRNA in\nthe ovaries of animals treated with TTshould be the main reason for the success of TTin\nremoving ovarian cysts [\n16]. Additionally, the GDF9 acting in theca cells regulates androgen\nproduction and subsequently affects granulosa cells in different ways \u2013by facilitating granulosa\nTribulus terrestris and BMP15 and GDF9 in Rabbit Ovary\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150400 February 29, 2016 12 / 17\ncell estrogen production from androgen aromatization, or by ensuring direct effects of andro-\ngens on granulosa cell growth through the androgen receptor that is expressed in granulosa\ncells [ 34,52].\nIf we accept the mainly discussed hypothesis that TTacts like the LH-hormone, a high level\nof GDF9 is also essential for modulating the LH receptors to ensure an adequate reaction to the\nhormone, because the oocyte-secreted factors, GDF9 and BMP15, have an effect on FSH and\nLH through the expression of their receptors on target cells [ 57\u201359]. Therefore, the upregula-\ntion of GDF9 in the oocytes and cumulus cells caused by TTexplains the consequences of TT\naction. However, the exact mechanism underlying the increase in GDF9 level remains unclear\nand requires further investigations.\nThe analysis of mRNA levels of BMP15 and GDF9 in the oocytes and cumulus cells of F1\nfemale offspring showed heritable changes in the BMP15 gene function. The down regulation\nof this gene was expressed also in the oocytes of F1 females born to treated mothers. Our resultsstrongly suggest that rabbit \u2019s oocytes are susceptible to epigenetic modulations during folliculo-\ngenesis and that the bioactive supplement VHT should be one of the factors causing this trans-\ngenerational epigenetic effect related to BMP15. Epigenetic processes can occur due to thedirect exposure to external factors at critical periods, particularly during sensitive developmen-tal windows for the germ cells, such as folliculogenesis [ 60]. Nutrition, as an environmental fac-\ntor, affects oocytes. Therefore, changes in the environment surrounding oocytes can alter the\npattern of genes expressed by these structures, with consequences for both immediate and lon-ger-term development [ 61]. Despite the fact that rabbits belong to a group of mammals that do\nnot ovulate spontaneously, it is known that follicles develop and regress in cycles of 15 \u221216\ndays. It seems that the exposure of the rabbit mothers to the bioactive supplement TTduring\n45 days of the periconceptual period was sufficient to induce changes in the oocytes-secreted\ngene BMP15. It is likely that the pathways of TTaction on the investigated growth factors are\ndifferent. The upregulation of GDF9 mRNA in the oocytes and cumulus cells stimulated by TT\nwas not inherited in F1 females; moreover, we observed a lower level of GDF9 mRNA in theoocytes and cumulus cells of these animals compared to the F1 females born to the control\nmothers.\nConclusions\nThe present study provides for the first time the evidence for the stimulating effect of TTon\nthe expression of GDF9 and BMP15 at mRNA and protein levels in the oocytes and cumulus\ncells of rabbits in two generations. The results indicate that these growth factors are sensitive to\nthe bioactive compounds of TTin different ways at different follicle structures. At the same\ntime, GDF9 and BMP15 showed their interchangeability in rabbits. Therefore, overexpressionof GDF9 in the case of BMP15 suppression ensured normal development and ovulation of the\nfollicles and high fertility at the first insemination after the treatment.\nThe present study provides insights into the therapeutic effect of the plant T.terrestris on\nfemale reproduction at the molecular level. Further studies are required to elucidate the exact\npathways of TTaction on growth factors expression, as well as on the epigenetic mechanisms\nof the influence of TTon F1 female offspring.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Table.
