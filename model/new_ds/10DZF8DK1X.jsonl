Furthermore, patients with obesity and cardiovascular disease\nare more likely to have suboptimal vitamin B6 status than healthy people. Therefore, we investigated\nthe e \u000bects of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on hepatic gene expression and function in obese\nmice. C57BL /6J male mice were fed a low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet in combination with\nsu\u000ecient (7 mg pyridoxine /kg diet) or insu \u000ecient (1 mg) amounts of vitamin B6 for 16 weeks.\nAnalysis of microarray data revealed that expressions of 4000 genes were signi\ufb01cantly altered by the\nexperimental diets (LF7, LF1, HF7, and HF1). The e \u000bects of dietary fat content on gene expressions\nwere markedly greater than vitamin B6 content. Only three di \u000berentially expressed genes (DEGs)\nwere overlapped between the LF1 /LF7 and HF1 /HF7 comparison. In the LF1 /LF7 comparison,\n54 upregulated DEGs were enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms associated with the sterol metabolic\nprocess and 54 downregulated DEGs were enriched in GO terms associated with immune response.\nIn HF1 /HF7 comparison, 26 upregulated DEGs were enriched in GO terms associated with amino acid\ncatabolic process. High-fat consumption downregulated gene expressions associated with vitamin\nB6-dependent pathways. In conclusion, our data suggest that obesity may di \u000berentially regulate\nvitamin B6-associated metabolic pathways in the body.\nKeywords: amino acid metabolism; dietary vitamin B6 restriction; high-fat diet; immunity; mice;\nsterol metabolism; transcriptome\n1. Introduction\nEpidemiological studies have reported that an insu \u000ecient intake of vitamin B6 and low plasma\nconcentrations of pyridoxal 50-phosphate (PLP), a metabolically active form of vitamin B6, are associated\nwith diabetes, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [ 1\u20134]. Furthermore, vitamin\nB6 de\ufb01ciency has been shown to alter both cell-mediated and humoral immunity [ 5,6]. PLP serves\nas a coenzyme of numerous enzymatic reactions in carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism\nthrough decarboxylation, transamination, racemization, elimination, and \f-group interconversion [ 7].\nIn particular, PLP plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal homocysteine levels by regulating the\nactivities of PLP-dependent enzymes in transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways. Additionally,\nseveral studies have reported anti-oxidative [8] and anti-in\ufb02ammatory [9] e \u000bects of vitamin B6.\nSince vitamin B6 is found in various foods, dietary vitamin B6 inadequacy is di \u000ecult to \ufb01nd\namong people who eat regular diets. However, vitamin B6 insu \u000eciency is common [ 10\u201313] and could\nNutrients 2020 ,12, 3821; doi:10.3390 /nu12123821 www.mdpi.com /journal /nutrients\nNutrients 2020 ,12, 3821 2 of 10\nbe aggravated by a food-derived anti-pyridoxine factor [ 14]. Plasma PLP concentrations less than\n20 nmol /L indicates de\ufb01ciency and less than 30 nmol /L indicates marginal de\ufb01ciency or insu \u000eciency\nin humans [11,15].\nIn animal studies of marginal de\ufb01ciency induced by insu \u000ecient vitamin B6 supply,\nplasma concentrations of amino acids and lipophilic metabolites, such as N-acyl amino acids and\nbile acids, were signi\ufb01cantly changed [ 14,16,17]. Similarly, plasma concentrations of several amino\nacids and their metabolites, including glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cystathionine, and glutathione,\nwere signi\ufb01cantly changed in humans with marginal vitamin B6 de\ufb01ciency [ 18\u201320]. However, little is\nknown about the e \u000bects of marginal vitamin B6 de\ufb01ciency on the gene expression pro\ufb01le in the liver.\nFurthermore, most studies on vitamin B6 de\ufb01ciency have been conducted on healthy individuals or\nanimals fed a control diet. In this study, we compared the e \u000bect of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on\nhepatic transcriptome between non-obese and high-fat fed obese mice to investigate whether obesity\nmay di \u000berentially regulate vitamin B6-associated metabolic pathways in the body.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Animals and Diets\nFour-week old C57BL /6J male mice were purchased from Raon Bio (Yongin, Korea) and housed\nin a temperature (22 \u00063\u000eC) and humidity (50 \u000610%) controlled room with a 12 h light\u2013dark cycle.\nAfter 12 days of acclimation [5 days with a chow diet and 7 days with a control low-fat (12% kcal from\nfat) diet with 7 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride (PN) /kg diet], mice were randomly divided into the four\ngroups ( n=8\u20139) and fed an LF7 (low-fat diet with 7 mg PN /kg diet), LF1 (low-fat diet with 1 mg PN /kg\ndiet), HF7 [high-fat (45% kcal from fat) diet with 7 mg PN /kg diet], or HF1 (high-fat diet with 1 mg\nPN/kg diet) diet. The experimental diets were provided ad libitum for 16 weeks. The composition\nof the diets is shown in Supplementary Materials Table S1. The recommended amount of PN is a\n7 mg /kg diet according to the AIN-93 formulation [ 21] and a 1 mg PN /kg diet has been reported as\nthe minimum level to prevent a growth retardation [ 22]. At the end of the experiments, the animals\nwere fasted for 12 h and sacri\ufb01ced after intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg /kg Zoletil (Virbac, Carros,\nFrance) and 10 mg /kg Rompun (Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea). Blood samples were collected by cardiac\npuncture. To obtain serum, blood was left at room temperature for 1 h and centrifuged at 3000 rpm,\n4\u000eC for 20 min. The organs were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u000080\u000eC until analysis.\nAll animal experiments were approved by Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources of Seoul National\nUniversity (SNU-161111-1-2), and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Institutional Animal\nCare and Use Committee of Seoul National University.\n2.2. Serum and Hepatic Biochemical Analysis\nSerum glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT)\nconcentrations were analyzed using commercial colorimetric assay kits (Asan Pharmaceutical Co.,\nSeoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After extraction of hepatic total lipids [ 23],\ncholesterol concentrations were determined using the same commercial kit. Hepatic TG and total\nbile acid concentrations were determined by thin-layer chromatography [ 24] and a total bile assay\nreagent kit (Gentaur, San Jose, CA, USA), respectively. Hepatic total homocysteine concentrations were\nmeasured using high-performance liquid chromatography, as previously described [25].\n2.3. Tissue Histologic Examination\nThe dissected liver tissues were \ufb01xed with formalin, embedded in para \u000en, sectioned into\n4\u0016m-thick sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological analysis.\nThe morphology was examined under an Olympus BX50 microscope using a DP-72 digital camera\n(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and captured using the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics Inc.,\nRockville, MD, USA).\nNutrients 2020 ,12, 3821 3 of 10\n2.4. Microarray Analysis\nTotal hepatic RNA was extracted using RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and RNA\npurity and integrity were con\ufb01rmed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,\nCA, USA). Transcriptome analysis was performed with A \u000bymetrix Mouse Clariom S arrays (Thermo\nFisher Scienti\ufb01c, Waltham, MA, USA) as described previously [ 26]. To identify di \u000berentially expressed\ngenes (DEGs) among groups, statistical signi\ufb01cance of the expression data was determined using\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, p<0.05). DEGs between two groups were selected based\non the cut-o \u000bcriteria ( |fold change |\u00151.5 and p<0.05). Functional analysis of DEGs was performed\nusing the Gene Ontology (GO) database, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway,\nand WikiPathways. False discovery rate was corrected by p-value using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg\nalgorithm. Heatmaps and volcano plots were constructed using the PermutMatrix software and R\npackage, respectively.\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nExperimental results except for microarray data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 23;\nIBM SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA). Data are expressed as the mean \u0006SEM and were analyzed by\none-way ANOVA followed by Duncan\u2019s multiple range test. Di \u000berences with p<0.05 were considered\nstatistically signi\ufb01cant.\n3. Results\n3.1. E \u000bects of Dietary Vitamin B6 Restriction on Serum and Hepatic Biochemical Parameters of Mice\nConsumption of a high-fat diet signi\ufb01cantly increased body weight in both vitamin B6-su \u000ecient\nand -de\ufb01cient groups (Figure 1a). Relative weights of liver and epididymal fat were also signi\ufb01cantly\nincreased by high-fat feeding (Figure 1b,c). Both body weight and relative organ weights were not\nsigni\ufb01cantly changed by dietary vitamin B6 amount.\nHigh-fat feeding signi\ufb01cantly increased serum glucose concentrations, which were decreased by\ndietary vitamin B6 restriction (Figure 1d). Serum triglyceride concentrations were signi\ufb01cantly reduced\nby high-fat feeding, which tended to increase in mice fed a vitamin B6-restricted diet (Figure 1e).\nNo signi\ufb01cant e \u000bect of dietary vitamin B6 restriction was observed in serum cholesterol, serum GPT,\nhepatic triglyceride, and hepatic cholesterol levels, which were signi\ufb01cantly higher in HF-fed mice\ncompared to LF-fed mice (Figure 1f\u2013i, Supplementary Materials Figure S1). Hepatic bile acid levels\nwere not signi\ufb01cantly di \u000berent between the groups (Figure 1j). Previous studies have reported\nthat mice with hepatic steatosis exhibited increased free fatty acid uptake and TG synthesis [ 27].\nFurthermore, stimulation of lipoprotein lipase activity has been shown to be associated with reduced\nserum triglyceride concentrations in subjects with hepatic steatosis [28].\n3.2. E \u000bects of Dietary Vitamin B6 Restriction on Hepatic Transcriptome of Mice\nGlobal gene expression was analyzed to identify signatures in hepatic genes related to experimental\ndiets. Based on microarray analysis, expressions of 4000 genes were signi\ufb01cantly altered and were\nlargely dependent on fat content rather than vitamin B6 content in the diet (Figure 2a). Figure 2b,c show\nvolcano plots of DEGs altered by vitamin B6 amount in mice fed a low-fat and high-fat diet, respectively.\nAmong 108 DEGs in the LF1 /LF7 comparison and 44 DEGs in HF1 /HF7 comparison, Venn diagram\nshows only three overlapping DEGs, Asl,Nnmt , and Sds(Figure 2d). All of these genes encode\nPLP-binding proteins that are involved in amino acid metabolism, including the urea cycle, amino acid\nmethylation, and serine metabolism, respectively.\nNutrients 2020 ,12, 3821 4 of 10\nNutrients 2020 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 10 \n 2.4.

Results \n3.1. Effects of Dietary Vitamin B6 Restriction on  Serum and Hepatic Biochemical Parameters of Mice \nConsumption of a high-fat diet significantly increased body weight in both vitamin B6-sufficient \nand -deficient groups (Figure 1a).

Serum triglyceride concentrations were significantly reduced by high-fat feeding, which tended to increase in mice fed a vitamin B6-restricted diet (Figure 1e). No significant effect of dietary vitamin B6 re striction was observed in serum cholesterol, serum \nGPT, hepatic triglyceride, and hepatic cholesterol levels, which were significantly higher in HF-fed \nmice compared to LF-fed mice (Figure 1f\u2013i, Supplementary Materials Figure S1).

Effects of Dietary Vitamin B6 Restri ction on Hepatic Transcriptome of Mice \nGlobal gene expression was analyzed to identify signatures in hepatic genes related to \nexperimental diets. Based on microarray analys is, expressions of 4000 genes were significantly \naltered and were largely dependent on fat content ra ther than vitamin B6 content in the diet (Figure \n2a). Figure 2b,c show volcano plot s of DEGs altered by vitamin B6 amount in mice fed a low-fat and \nhigh-fat diet, respectively. Among 108 DEGs in the LF1/LF7 comparison and 44 DEGs in HF1/HF7 comparison, Venn diagram shows only three overlapping DEGs, Asl, Nnmt , and Sds (Figure 2d). All \nof these genes encode PLP-binding proteins that are involved in amino acid metabolism, including the urea cycle, amino acid methylation, and serine metabolism, respectively. \nFurthermore, we found the distinct effects of dietar y vitamin B6 restriction in mice fed either LF or \nHF. According to the KEGG enrichment heatmap, \u201cJak-STAT signaling pathway\u201d and \u201csteroid biosynthesis\u201d, were signif icantly associated with DEGs in the LF1/LF7 comparison (Figure 2e).

Discussion \nMany epidemiological studies indicate that obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease \npatients have poorer vitamin B6 status than he althy subjects, implicating the important role of \nvitamin B6 in the regulation of metabolism [1\u20133]. Furt hermore, high intake of vitamin B6 is associated \nwith lower risks of various cancers [29]. Here, we report that high-fat diet-induced obesity \ndifferentially regulates vitamin B6-mediated me tabolic pathways in the liver based on gene \nexpression profiles of mice fed either a sufficient  or restricted vitamin B6  diet. Although several \nstudies have reported that changes in metabolites in marginal vitamin B6 deficiency model, few \nstudies have performed gene expression profiling in this setting. To the best of our knowledge, this \nstudy is the first to determine the hepatic gene expr ession profile in mice fed a vitamin B6-restricted \ndiet. \nIn comparison of the hepatic gene expression profile between LF1 and LF7 groups, we observed \nupregulation of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and downregulation of genes involved in immune response. In previous studies, the effects of vitamin B6 deficiency on cholesterol \naccumulation were not consistent [30\u201333]. Here, we observed that expression levels of several genes \ninvolved in cholesterol synthesis were significantly higher in the LF1 group compared to the LF7 group without concomitant changes in serum and hepa tic cholesterol concentrations, indicating that \ndietary vitamin B6 restriction may increase a conversion of cholesterol into bile acid. Accordingly, plasma concentrations of bile acids, including glycocholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and \nmurocholic acid, were increased in moderately vita min B6-deficient rats [17]. Although hepatic total \nbile acid levels tended to be higher in the LF1 group compared to the LF7 group, this trend did not \nreach statistical significance. Unlike previous studies using an absolute deficiency of vitamin B6 \nmodel [34,35], dietary vitamin B6 restri ction did not induce hepatic steatosis. \nAs shown in the present study in mice fed a lo w-fat diet, vitamin B6 deficiency is shown to \nreduce antibody production and to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, leading to impaired immune responses [5,6,36]. Conversely, there were no si gnificantly enriched GO terms associated with \nimmunity between HF1 and HF7. Because the immune response is highly associated with high-fat feeding, consumption of a high-fat diet may mask the suppressive effect of vitamin B6 on immune \nresponse. Indeed, DEGs in the HF7/LF7 comparison were significantly enriched in GO terms, \nincluding \u201cimmune system process\u201d, \u201cimmune response\u201d, and \u201cinflammatory response\u201d. \nConsumption of a low vitamin B6 diet altered plasma concentrations of amino acids and their \nmetabolites in human studies [20]. We observed that several amino acid metabolic pathways were significantly regulated by dietary vitamin B6 restriction, especially in mice fed a high-fat diet. \nFigure 5.

Among 11 DEGs enriched in the GO term\n\u201cpyridoxal phosphate binding\u201d, expression of Sptlc2 andSptlc3 genes involved in lipid metabolism\nwere upregulated and the remaining nine DEGs were downregulated in the high-fat groups compared\nto the low-fat groups, implicating the overall downregulation of pathways involving PLP as a cofactor\nin response to a high fat consumption.\n4. Discussion\nMany epidemiological studies indicate that obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease\npatients have poorer vitamin B6 status than healthy subjects, implicating the important role of vitamin\nB6 in the regulation of metabolism [ 1\u20133]. Furthermore, high intake of vitamin B6 is associated with\nlower risks of various cancers [ 29]. Here, we report that high-fat diet-induced obesity di \u000berentially\nregulates vitamin B6-mediated metabolic pathways in the liver based on gene expression pro\ufb01les of\nmice fed either a su \u000ecient or restricted vitamin B6 diet. Although several studies have reported that\nchanges in metabolites in marginal vitamin B6 de\ufb01ciency model, few studies have performed gene\nexpression pro\ufb01ling in this setting. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the \ufb01rst to determine\nthe hepatic gene expression pro\ufb01le in mice fed a vitamin B6-restricted diet.\nIn comparison of the hepatic gene expression pro\ufb01le between LF1 and LF7 groups, we observed\nupregulation of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and downregulation of genes involved in\nimmune response. In previous studies, the e \u000bects of vitamin B6 de\ufb01ciency on cholesterol accumulation\nwere not consistent [ 30\u201333]. Here, we observed that expression levels of several genes involved in\ncholesterol synthesis were signi\ufb01cantly higher in the LF1 group compared to the LF7 group without\nconcomitant changes in serum and hepatic cholesterol concentrations, indicating that dietary vitamin B6\nrestriction may increase a conversion of cholesterol into bile acid. Accordingly, plasma concentrations of\nbile acids, including glycocholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and murocholic acid, were increased\nin moderately vitamin B6-de\ufb01cient rats [ 17]. Although hepatic total bile acid levels tended to be\nhigher in the LF1 group compared to the LF7 group, this trend did not reach statistical signi\ufb01cance.\nUnlike previous studies using an absolute de\ufb01ciency of vitamin B6 model [34,35], dietary vitamin B6\nrestriction did not induce hepatic steatosis.\nAs shown in the present study in mice fed a low-fat diet, vitamin B6 de\ufb01ciency is shown to\nreduce antibody production and to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, leading to impaired immune\nresponses [ 5,6,36]. Conversely, there were no signi\ufb01cantly enriched GO terms associated with immunity\nNutrients 2020 ,12, 3821 8 of 10\nbetween HF1 and HF7. Because the immune response is highly associated with high-fat feeding,\nconsumption of a high-fat diet may mask the suppressive e \u000bect of vitamin B6 on immune response.\nIndeed, DEGs in the HF7 /LF7 comparison were signi\ufb01cantly enriched in GO terms, including \u201cimmune\nsystem process\u201d, \u201cimmune response\u201d, and \u201cin\ufb02ammatory response\u201d.\nConsumption of a low vitamin B6 diet altered plasma concentrations of amino acids and\ntheir metabolites in human studies [ 20]. We observed that several amino acid metabolic pathways\nwere signi\ufb01cantly regulated by dietary vitamin B6 restriction, especially in mice fed a high-fat diet.\nParticularly, sulfur amino acid metabolism was signi\ufb01cantly altered by vitamin B6 insu \u000eciency in\nmice fed a high-fat diet. In previous studies, concentrations of cystathionine, a major metabolite in the\ntranssulfuration pathway, were increased in humans and animals with mild and complete vitamin B6\nde\ufb01ciencies [ 19,20,37]. Interestingly, we observed that consumption of high-fat diet exhibited more\napparent regulatory e \u000bects on expression of amino acid metabolizing enzymes requiring PLP than\nconsumption of a vitamin-B6-restricted diet. Although we did not measure concentrations of amino\nacids or amino acid metabolites, these results indicate that vitamin B6 de\ufb01ciency could play important\nroles in the regulation of amino acid metabolism in subjects with metabolic syndrome.\nThere are several possible ways by which vitamin B6 levels regulate gene expression in the present\nstudy. First, vitamin B6 has been shown to regulate the functions of steroid hormones, including\nglucocorticoids, androgen, progesterone, and estrogen by modulating steroid hormone-mediated\ngene expressions [ 38]. Second, vitamin B6 level regulates homocysteine levels, resulting in alterations\nin the cellular SAM:SAH ratio and DNA methyltransferase activity. Accordingly, we observed that\nhepatic homocysteine concentrations were signi\ufb01cantly increased by vitamin B6 de\ufb01ciency. A previous\nstudy reported that PLP de\ufb01ciency resulted in chromosome breaks and rearrangements in Drosophila,\nwhich were increased in the presence of sucrose and its precursors [39].\n5. Conclusions\nAlthough e \u000bects of dietary vitamin B6 absence on regulation of amino acid metabolism have\nbeen actively conducted, the involved molecular mechanisms of vitamin B6 are not clearly known.\nIn the present study, we observed functional e \u000bects of dietary vitamin B6 restriction on cholesterol\nmetabolism and immune response in mice fed a low-fat diet. On the other hand, functional e \u000bects of\ndietary vitamin B6 restriction on amino acid metabolism were observed in mice fed a high-fat diet by\nhepatic gene expression pro\ufb01le analysis. These results provide evidence of the distinct role of a high-fat\ndiet in alteration of PLP-associated pathways in the liver of mice in response to dietary vitamin B6\nrestriction. Because PLP is a cofactor of various enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism,\nfurther research is warranted to explore the e \u000bects of vitamin B6 insu \u000eciency on brain function.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http: //www.mdpi.com /2072-6643 /12/12/3821/s1,\nTable S1: Composition of experimental diet, Table S2: Top 10 enriched GO terms of upregulated DEGs in LF1 /LF7,\nTable S3: Top 10 enriched GO terms of downregulated DEGs in LF1 /LF7, Table S4: Top 10 enriched GO terms of\nupregulated DEGs in HF1 /HF7, Figure S1: Representative hematoxylin and eosin staining of the liver.\nAuthor Contributions: H.-J.U. and Y.H.K. conceived and designed the experiments; H.-J.U. and J.W.K. conducted\nthe experiments; H.-J.U., S.B.W. and Y.H.K. analyzed the data; H.-J.U., S.B.W. and Y.H.K. wrote the paper.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation\nof Korea (NRF-2017R1A2B4011432).\nCon\ufb02icts of Interest: The authors have no con\ufb02ict of interest to declare.\nNutrients 2020 ,12, 3821 9 of 10\nReferences\n1.
