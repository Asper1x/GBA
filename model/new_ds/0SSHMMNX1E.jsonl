To\nreduce assessment bias maximally and increase the accuracy and objectivity of the outcomes, the trial design was tripleblinded in a manner that neither the subjects nor the person administering the products nor the person who assessed the\nprimary outcomes knew which subjects had received the test product and which had received the placebo. The expert grader\nassessing the confocal laser scanning microscopy images was additionally blinded regarding the time when the image wastaken (on days 1 or 85). The objective, blinded, and validated image analyses using confocal laser scanning microscopyshowed a signi\ufb01cant improvement of the collagen structure of facial skin (primary endpoint) after intake of the test product,\nwhile no improvements were found after intake of the placebo. The proven positive nutritional effect on the collagen structure\nwas fully consistent with positive subjective evaluations of relevant skin parameters such as elasticity, crinkliness/wrinkliness,and evenness in different body areas such as face, hands, de \u00b4collete \u00b4, neck, backside, legs, and belly, all serving as secondary\nendpoints. The test product was found to be safe and very well tolerated. A cosmetically relevant improvement of the facial\nskin was demonstrated after administration of the collagen supplement.\nKEYWORDS: /C15antiaging /C15collagen peptides /C15dermal collagen structure /C15dermonutrient /C15oral collagen supplement\n/C15skin beauty\nINTRODUCTION\nThe environment as well as stress and chronological\naging can induce irreversible, and also reversible,\nchanges in the structural components of the skin that lead tovisible signs of aging such as increased dryness and wrinkleformation.\n1\u20133The appearance of the skin depends to a large\nextent on the homeostasis of the dermal extracellular matrixthat is primarily de\ufb01ned by collagen and similar \ufb01bers.\n4\nOrally administered collagen peptides and synergisticallyacting dermonutrients can reach the deeper layer of the skinand stimulate the endogenous production of extracellular\nmatrix components in the skin.\n5These oligopeptides arederived from an enzymatic hydrolysis leading to highly\nbioavailable and thus bioactive short-chain collagen pep-\ntides that are able to induce bene\ufb01cial cosmetic effects.6The\npurpose of this study was to investigate the cosmetic effectof a collagen supplement on the appearance of skin inhealthy women.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy design and ethical aspects\nThe study was performed using a randomized, parallel\ngroup, placebo-controlled, and double-blind design follow-ing the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The study wasregistered in the German Clinical Trial Register and theICTRP (no. DRKS00017093). The investigation was in fullcompliance with the principles outlined in the Declarationof Helsinki and with national regulations. A written decla-ration of informed consent was received from all volunteers.The trial protocol was approved by the Freiburg EthicsCommittee International on December 18, 2017.\nAddress correspondence to: Stephan Bielfeldt, Dipl Ing, proDERM Institute for Applied\nDermatological Research, Kiebitzweg 2, Schenefeld-Hamburg D-22869, Germany,\nE-mail: sbielfeldt@proderm.de\n#Sabrina Laing et al. 2020; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

All participants \ufb01nished\nthe study without major protocol deviations. The main ex-clusion criteria were active skin diseases at the measurementarea, systemic therapy with i mmunosuppressive drugs, anti-\nphlogistic agents, analgesic dr ugs, antihistamines or antibiot-\nics, or topical medication at the measurement site before the\nstart of the study and/or throughout the entire course of the\nstudy, and intensive use of skin care products at the mea-surement site within 1 month before the start of the study.\nParticipants were instructed not to apply any leave-on or\ndecorative cosmetics on the measurement site in the morn-ing before the start of the study, to maintain their livinghabits, and not to begin or change any estrogen or proges-terone therapy. Any intake of other products, which mayhave an effect on the skin during the study, was not allowed.\nStudy schedule\nEighty-four units (drinking ampoules) of the study\nproduct (25 mL per unit) were provided to each participant.The products were to be taken by the subjects at home, oncea day before or together with a meal, for 12 weeks. As-sessment times were the day before the \ufb01rst intake (day 1)and the day after 12 weeks of intake (day 85). Complianceand tolerability were monitored on days 29, 57, and 85.Ef\ufb01cacy data were collected at the end of the study.\nTest materials\nThe study product is classi\ufb01ed as a food supplement. Both\nthe test product and placebo were delivered in identicaldrinking ampoules. The test product (Elasten\n/C210, QUIRIS\nHealthcare) contained 2.5 g speci\ufb01c short-chain collagenoligopeptides, 666 mg acerola fruit extract, 80 mg vitaminC, 3 mg zinc citrate, 2.3 mg vitamin E, and 50 lg biotin.\nAdditional ingredients also contained in the placebo prep-aration included potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, car-\nboxymethylcellulose, citric acid, natural aroma, and water.\nThe placebo did not contain any nutrients. Test product andplacebo were randomly assigned to two equally sized studyarms (30 participants in each).\nConfocal microscopy\nThe collagen structure ( i.e., the fragmentation of collagen\nin the reticular dermis) was assessed by confocal laserscanning microscopy (VIVASCOPE 1500; Lucid, Inc.,\nRochester, NY, USA), which allows the cellular micro-\nstructure to be visualized in 5 lm horizontal optical cross\nsections of the epidermis and the dermis with a maximaldepth of 200 lm.\n7The skin can be imaged in vivo in its\nnative state without further preparation. This method en-ables an in vivo mapping of the skin since the different\nmicrostructures within the skin cause natural variations ofthe refraction index. For example, cytoplasm with a re-fraction index close to that of water (re\ufb02ectance index 1.33)is depicted with a very low contrast. Melanin and keratin(re\ufb02ectance index 1.7) have a higher refraction index and\nthereby act as natural contrast agents. The optical sectionresolution is 5 lm with an image size of 500 \u00b7500lm. The\ntest area was also captured with a macrocamera, which al-lowed correlated confocal and photographic images. All\nmeasurements were done on the cheeks after an acclimati-\nzation period of at least 30 min in a climatized room(21\u20131/C176C and 50 \u20135% relative humidity) under highly\nstandardized conditions. If necessary, facial hairs werecarefully removed with a clipper by a technician 30 minbefore the measurement was taken.\nCollagen structure\nThe collagen structure, the appearance of which is de-\ntermined by the relationship between reticulated, coarse,huddled, and curled collagen \ufb01bers, changes with age.Young-looking healthy skin mostly shows thin reticulated\ufb01bers. With aging, the proportion of thin reticulated \ufb01bersprogressively decreases, in favor of coarse and huddledcollagen \ufb01bers. In addition, the proportion of bright curled\ufb01bers progressively increases in older people.\n8\nSuch changes are clearly recognizable in confocal im-\nages. With age, the dermal collagen network becomes in-creasingly fragmented, which is characterized by shorterand less organized \ufb01bers and accumulating degraded col-lagen fragments. The younger and healthier the skin, thelarger, more diffuse, and less fragmented are the collagenstructures. Differences between confocal images taken be-fore and after the intervention were assessed by an expertgrader, based on the degree of collagen fragmentation. Thecollagen structure was assessed using at least three uni-formly distributed stacks over the measurement area in the\nface, starting within the stratum corneum with up to 40\nrepetitions at 5 lm scanning steps. Confocal images tar-\ngeting the area of the collagen network were chosen foranalysis. Images taken on days 1 and 85 were compared on acomputer screen in a validated, blinded, and left/right ran-domized manner by the expert grader on a visual analogscale (VAS) from -50 (=left image better) to +50 (=right\nimage better) (Fig. 1). For details of the blinding procedure,see chapter 2.8.\nFIG. 1. Assessment of the appearance of the collagen structure by\nexpert graders using images of confocal laser scanning microscopy\n(VIVASCOPE).148 LAING ET AL.\nSubjective evaluation\nSubjective assessments of product traits and cosmetic\neffectiveness on the quality of the skin were recorded on day85 using a questionnaire. The general evaluation of producteffects on the skin was covered using 15 questions/state-ments concerning the improvement of the following criteria:dryness, scaliness, elasticity, complexion, \ufb01rmness, crink-liness, radiance, evenness, softness, healthiness and sup-\npleness of the skin, the need for external care products, the\nperception of a high product effect, the perception of astrong product effect, the evaluation of skin changes noticedby people in the participants\u2018 personal environment, and thegeneral satisfaction with the product. Furthermore, thepositive product effects (less dry, fewer wrinkles/scales,more radiant/even/supple, softer, healthier, \ufb01rmer) wererelated to one or more of the body areas (face, hands,de\u00b4collete \u00b4, neck, backside, legs, belly) at the end of the study.\nThe tolerability and digestibility of the product, as well as\nthe sensitivity of the skin, were also assessed at the end of\nthe study. Adverse events or severe adverse events and\nchanges in concomitant therapy, as well as compliancechecks, had to be documented on days 29, 57, and 85.\nBlinding\nThe triple-blinded procedure was chosen to maximally\nreduce assessment bias and to increase the accuracy andobjectivity of the outcomes. The trial design was triple-blinded in a manner that neither the subject nor the personadministering the products nor the person who assessed theprimary outcomes knew which subjects had received the testproduct and which had received a placebo. The expert gra-der of the confocal laser scanning microscopy images was\nadditionally blinded regarding the time when the image was\ntaken (on days 1 or 85).\nStatistical analyses\nSafety and tolerance data listing was based on the safety\npopulation (intention to treat population), which included alltrial participants who were enrolled into the study and whoreceived at least the \ufb01rst dose of the study intervention. Theef\ufb01cacy analysis was based on the per-protocol population,including all subjects randomized in the study in accordancewith both the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who \ufb01n-ished the study according to the protocol without any majorprotocol violations and who had not withdrawn their consent.\nThe primary endpoint of the study was de\ufb01ned as the\nchange in the collagen structure. The mean value of at least\nthree image gradings per subject was used as raw data forfurther statistical analyses and comparison of placebo andverum. For the descriptive data analysis of the collagenstructure, number of individuals (N), means, standard devi-ations, and 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (CI) of all subjects werecalculated. Bar charts with mean values and 95% CIs werecreated to compare the placebo and verum interventions. Forthe primary analysis, a t-test for independent samples with a\nsigni\ufb01cance level of a=0.05 was conducted on the raw data.The secondary endpoint was the trial participants\u2019 sub-\njective assessment of product effects on the quality of theskin by the subjects enrolled in this controlled study. Withinthe context of a descriptive data analysis, a signi\ufb01cancelevel of 0.05 ( a) was chosen for statistical analysis. Counts,\npercentages, and means of scores were provided for all\nparameters of the questionnair e. For the parameter colla-\ngen structure, pairwise comparisons of postinterventionassessment and baseline were performed on the raw datafor each intervention separately with paired t-tests versus\nthe benchmark of 0 (no differences between assessmenttimes). The parameters of the subjective assessmentsserving as the secondary endpoint were analyzed using theMann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon test fo r pairwise comparison of\nthe study groups.\nStatistical analyses were performed according to the\nprinciples of the ICH guideline E9 \u2018\u2018Statistical Principles for\nClinical Trials\u2019\u2019 using the SAS software, version 9.4 forWindows, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA.\nRESULTS\nCONSORT \ufb02ow diagram of the controlled\ninterventional trial\nSixty trial participants with a mean age of 54.4 \u20137.5 years\nwere statistically analyzed. No trial participants had to be\nexcluded during screening or at any point in the study. Thestudy population and the per-protocol population wereidentical ( n=60). The \ufb02ow of subjects through the con-\ntrolled interventional trial is depicted in a CONSORT(Consolidated Statement of Reporting Trials) conform dia-gram (Fig. 2).\nThe study was conducted as a two-arm interventional trial\nof the test product against placebo for 12 weeks. All enrolledsubjects were examined before the \ufb01rst intake of test productor placebo (day 1) and after 12 weeks of intake of test\nproduct or placebo (day 85). The safety and ef\ufb01cacy of the\ntest product compared with placebo could be con\ufb01rmed forthe entire study population.\nAnalyses of collagen structure\nby confocal microscopy\nThe application of the confocal laser scanning microscopy\nprocedure provides the opportunity to visualize the collagenstructure in the subcutaneous tissue in vivo . This method\nallows a demonstration of the in\ufb02uence of an oral collagensupplement not only on skin characteristics but also espe-\ncially on the presence of collagen \ufb01bers as the most impor-\ntant structural protein of the skin. With the help of a blindedexpert grader analyzing such randomly presented micros-copy images taken before and after 12 weeks of supple-mentation of placebo and the test product, a signi\ufb01cantimprovement of the collagen structure of the facial skincould be demonstrated in response to the test product.Figure 3 shows the different appearances of the collagenstructure on day 1 and on day 85 using the example of a singlesubject (RD47) from the active ( verum) intervention group:EFFECTS OF A DERMONUTRIENT ON SKIN PHYSIOLOGY 149\nthe evaluation of the collagen structure ( i.e.,d e g r e eo fc o l l a -\ngen fragmentation) for day 85 (right image) was considerably\nimproved, re\ufb02ected by an expert rating of +27 within the VAS\nrange of between -50 (left image much better) and +50 (right\nimage much better).\nBoth the intragroup changes and the intergroup differ-\nences con\ufb01rmed the positive effect of the test product on thehuman skin. The collagen structure and therefore the qualityof the dermis were signi\ufb01cantly improved on day 85 com-pared with benchmark 0 on day 1 after intake of the testproduct. In contrast, no signi\ufb01cant difference to benchmark0 was detected for placebo. As such, the comparison of\ntreatments revealed a signi\ufb01cantly better outcome for the\ntest product than for placebo. Figure 4 demonstrates the\nimprovement of the facial collagen structure by the testproduct compared with placebo. Intake of placebo resultedin a slight but not signi\ufb01cant deterioration of the collagenstructure on day 85 compared with day 1.\nAnalyses of subjective assessments\n(secondary endpoints)\nThe analyses of the questionnaire concerning the cos-\nmetic effectiveness of the products revealed a clear overallpreference of the test product.\nThe superiority of the test product compared with placebo\nbecomes clearer through summation of the single scores(\u2018\u20182\u2019\u2019 =I completely agree; \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019 =I agree; \u2018\u20180\u2019\u2019 =neither.nor;\n\u2018\u2018-1\u2019\u2019=I disagree; \u2018\u2018 -2\u2019\u2019=I completely disagree). A higher\nsum score with a better evaluation for the test product wasfound (Fig. 5) for all criteria, with the exception of one cri-\nterion (Q19) \u2018\u2018external care products less often,\u2019\u2019 with no\ndifference between test product and placebo. The differencesin favor of the test product are signi\ufb01cant for items regardingskin moisture, suppleness, and softness of skin after productintake. Trial participants noted a superior effect of the testproduct compared with placebo in all named areas of thebody. The best subjective ratings in favor of the test productwere found for the backside, legs, neck, and belly, with themost frequently named improvements being \u2018\u2018less dry,\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018fewer wrinkles,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018more even,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018more supple.\u2019\u2019\nFIG. 3.

No adverse ef-fects were reported. The test product was safe and very welltolerated.\nDISCUSSION\nThis randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind trial\ndemonstrated the cosmetic effects of a food supplement withspecial collagen peptides and other dermonutrients on skinquality and collagen structure by means of confocal laserscanning microscopy.\nReduction of assessment bias is essential and increases\nthe accuracy and objectivity. This was achieved by ran-domization and triple-blinding, through which the treatmentmodality was unknown to (1) the trial participant, (2) thepersons who administered the products, and (3) the personwho assessed the outcomes. The expert grader of the con-\nfocal laser scanning microscopy images was also blinded\nregarding the time when the image was taken (pre/posttreatment).\nIngestion of collagen peptides can increase collagen\nsynthesis but differ signi\ufb01cantly with regard to molecularsize and amino acid composition.\n5\u20137,9\u201311The speci\ufb01c bovine\ncollagen peptides of the [HC]-collagen-complex are char-acterized by a high homogeneity of the amino acid pro\ufb01lewith the human collagen protein. Previous peptide mass\ufb01ngerprinting and liquid chromatography-based proteomicmethods have demonstrated a high level of sequence iden-\ntity of bovine and porcine collagen with human skin colla-\ngen.\n12Small cryptic peptides called cryptides together with\nspeci\ufb01c cyclopeptides and matrikines generated from col-lagen biodegradation and bioresorption can enhance colla-gen synthesis in humans and can be successfully used toimprove, sustain, and maintain skin regeneration, renewal,and repair throughout the entire body.\n5,13\nA high bioavailability as assured by the speci\ufb01c digestion\nof the oligopeptides to the even shorter bioactive di- andtripeptides formed in the gastrointestinal tract supplies theskin with the speci\ufb01c collagen I and III protein amino acid\npattern needed to sustain a suf\ufb01cient synthesis of the deci-\nsive component of the skin biomatrix.\n5\u20137,10\u201312The collagen\nstructure also requires speci\ufb01c cofactors such as vitamin Cthat are needed for the formation of collagen as well asantioxidants that protect the protein from oxidation.\n14,15\nSince aging, stress, and pollution reduce collagen synthesisand thereby negatively impact skin appearance, suf\ufb01cientnutritional support is a decisive factor.\n1,5,6The results of this\ninterventional trial demonstrate the measurable cosmeticeffectiveness of the test product in improving skin quality.The \ufb01ndings are in line with those of previously published\nstudies investigating the effects of oral collagen supple-\nmentation on the dermal collagen network.\n5\u20137The measured\npositive changes in the structure of connective tissue areclearly associated with functional improvements as re\ufb02ectedby the clear and convincing effects noted in the subjectiveratings of the study participants.This randomized, placebo-contr olled, triple-blind trial con-\n\ufb01rmed the positive cosmetic effe cts of the collagen-containing\nfood supplement on the quality and appearance of the skin.\nAUTHOR DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nNo competing \ufb01nancial interests exist.\nFUNDING INFORMATION\nThis research was funded by QUIRIS Healthcare, Germany.\nREFERENCES\n1.
