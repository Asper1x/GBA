Our study aims at revealing therapeutic potential of vitamins B1\nand B6 by estimating the short- and long-term effects of their combined administration with the\nseizure inductor pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). The PTZ dose dependence of a seizure and its parameters\naccording to modi\ufb01ed Racine\u2019s scale, along with delayed physiological and biochemical consequences\nthe next day after the seizure are assessed regarding sexual dimorphism in epilepsy. PTZ sensitivity is\nstronger in the female than the male rats. The next day after a seizure, sex differences in behavior and\nbrain biochemistry arise. The induced sex differences in anxiety and locomotor activity correspond\nto the disappearance of sex differences in the brain aspartate and alanine, with appearance of those\nin glutamate and glutamine. PTZ decreases the brain malate dehydrogenase activity and urea in the\nmales and the phenylalanine in the females. The administration of vitamins B1 and B6 24 h before PTZ\ndelays a seizure in female rats only. This desensitization is not observed at short intervals ( 0.5\u20132 h )\nbetween the administration of the vitamins and PTZ. With the increasing interval, the pyridoxal\nkinase (PLK) activity in the female brain decreases, suggesting that the PLK downregulation by\nvitamins contributes to the desensitization. The delayed effects of vitamins and/or PTZ are mostly\nsex-speci\ufb01c and interacting. Our \ufb01ndings on the sex differences in sensitivity to epileptogenic factors,\naction of vitamins B1/B6 and associated biochemical events have medical implications.\nKeywords: amino acid neurotransmitter; glutamate; GABA; pentylenetetrazole; vitamin B1; vita-\nmin B6\n1. Introduction\nTriggered by abnormal brain activity, generally due to a disbalance between neuronal\nexcitation and inhibition, seizures are a hallmark of epilepsy, a common and predominantly\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14080737 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 2 of 23\npolygenic disease. In more than a half of the cases, the cause of epilepsy remains unknown.\nSome epilepsies, called vitamin-dependent, belong to rare genetic disorders caused by\nmutations in the genes involved in the metabolism of vitamins B1 and B6 [ 1\u20135]. Normal-\nization of the organismal vitamin status in these types of epilepsy has a therapeutic effect,\neliminating seizures that cannot be treated with known anti-seizure medications. Vitamins\nB1 and B6 may also contribute to other non-monogenic types of epilepsy. Although the role\nof vitamins in the pathology of epilepsy remains poorly understood, a number of enzymes\nparticipating in the metabolism of glutamate and GABA are altered in epilepsy. Those\ninclude not only the known targets of vitamin B6 (transaminases and decarboxylases), but\nalso the enzymes (e.g., glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH),\nglutamine synthetase (GS) and others) whose function may be regulated by vitamin B1\nbeyond the coenzyme action of this vitamin on the thiamine-diphosphate-dependent en-\nzymes, such as the dehydrogenases of 2-oxo acids [ 6\u201312]. Subclinical hypovitaminosis of\nB1 or B6 may arise in patients treated with widely used medications, including anti-seizure\nmedications [ 13\u201316], potentially facilitating the development of non-monogenic epilepsies.\nHence, upon dysfunction in the vitamin metabolism, either acquired or caused by genetic\ndefects, the administration of vitamins B1 and/or B6 may mitigate epileptic seizures and\ntheir long-standing consequences. This work aims to characterize potential therapeutic\neffect of the administration of these vitamins in a rat model of epilepsy, as well as effects of\na seizure on the brain central metabolism dependent on vitamins B1 and B6.\nOur study takes into account physiological observations on sexual dimorphism in\nepilepsy [ 17]. To induce a seizure, we employ a widely used model of pentylenetetrazole\n(PTZ) administration. Binding to the tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate site of the GABA-\nA receptor chloride channel, PTZ causes disbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory\npathways of neurotransmission [ 18\u201321]. Physiological manifestations are analyzed by\ncharacterizing the severity of a seizure and assessing its delayed effect on behavioral and\nECG parameters. To study the potential therapeutic effects of high doses of vitamins, the\nadministration of vitamins B1 and B6 is combined, in view of the B1-dependent regulation\nof B6 metabolism in animals [ 11]. The administered doses of the vitamins are equivalent\nto those known from medical applications in patients. To characterize the molecular\nmechanisms and pathways involved, the physiological assessment is combined with the\nanalysis of the consequences of a seizure for the brain biochemistry. In this part, the vitamin-\ndependent enzymes crucial for the brain metabolism of glutamate and GABA [ 1,2,22\u201326]\nare assayed, and the brain amino acid pro\ufb01les [ 23,24] are quanti\ufb01ed. As a result, we reveal\nsex differences in the sensitivity to PTZ administration, the biochemical markers of such\ndifferences and a dual sex-speci\ufb01c effect of the administration of vitamins B1 and B6 on a\nseizure associated with the regulation of the brain PLK activity.\n2. Results\n2.1. Sex Differences in the Susceptibility of Animals to the Seizure-Inducer PTZ and to the Delayed\nConsequences of a Seizure\nThe scheme of administration of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) has been selected to mini-\nmize mortality, simultaneously achieving a strong manifestation of the clonic and tonic\nseizures according to the Racine scale modi\ufb01ed for assessment of the PTZ-induced seizure\n(see Section 4). Accordingly, the PTZ dose received by individual animals varies depending\non their individual susceptibility (Supplementary Figure S1). Sensitivity of the male and\nfemale rats to the seizure inducer is characterized by an average PTZ dose and the patho-\nphysiological parameters of the seizure development, shown in Figure 1A. The average\nPTZ dose is practically the same for the female and male rats: 58 \u00064 vs. 60\u00064 mg/kg,\nrespectively (Figure 1A). However, the mean seizure score is signi\ufb01cantly (Mann\u2013Whitney\ntest, p= 0.05) lower in the male rats compared to the female ones (Figure 1A). In addition,\nmale rats experience convulsive twitching app. 4 min later (Mann\u2013Whitney test, p= 0.05),\ncompared to the female rats (Figure 1A). Thus, the obtained results indicate that female\nrats are more sensitive to the seizure induction by PTZ than male rats.\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 3 of 23\nPharmaceuticals 2021 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  3 of 27  \n depending on their individual susceptibility ( Supplementary Figure S1). Sensitivity of \nthe male and female rats to the seizure inducer is characterized by an average PTZ dose \nand the pathophysiological parameters of the seizure development, shown in Figure 1 A. \nThe average PTZ dose is practically the s ame for the female and male rats: 58  \u00b1 4 vs. 60 \u00b1 4 \nmg/kg, respectively ( Figure 1A). However, the mean seizure score is significantly ( Mann\u2013\nWhitney test , p = 0.05) lower in the male rats compared to the female ones ( Figure 1A). In \naddition, male rats experience convulsive twitching app. 4 min later ( Mann\u2013Whitney test , \np = 0.05), compared to the female rats ( Figure 1A). Thus, the obtained results indicate that \nfemale rats are more sensitive to the seizure induction by PTZ than male rats.  \n \nFigure 1.

Obviously, signi\ufb01cant sex differences in anxiety and locomotion\nafter a seizure represent a cumulative effect of minor and statistically insigni\ufb01cant shifts\nexhibited by each of the sexes in response to PTZ. This view is con\ufb01rmed by the two-way\nANOVA pointing to the statistical signi\ufb01cance of the factor of sex in the PTZ-induced\nchanges (Figure 1B). In addition to the behavioral parameters, the potential cardiological\nrisks of a seizure [ 27\u201329] may be estimated by ECG. As seen from Figure 1B, the ECG assay\ndoes not reveal signi\ufb01cant changes in the rats after the seizure.\nThe analysis of the biochemical markers in the cerebral cortex of the rats the next\nday after a seizure did not reveal a signi\ufb01cant effect of PTZ on the activity of the tested\nenzymes of the brains\u2019 neurotransmitter metabolism, with the exception of a decrease in the\nMDH activity (Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test, p= 0.03) in males (Figure 2).

Therefore, the in vivo levels of metabolites are a better\nmeasure of the biological impact of the minor differences in the enzymatic activities,\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 5 of 23\ndetermined in vitro (Figure 2). Indeed, the analysis of the levels of free amino acids in\nthe brain reveals multiple sex-dependent PTZ effects on the metabolites. As seen from\nFigure 3 , PTZ eliminates the pre-existing sex differences in the levels of aspartate and\nalanine, inducing those in the levels of glutamate and glutamine. The sex-speci\ufb01c effects of\nPTZ, such as decreases in urea in the brain of male rats, and phenylalanine in the brain of\nfemale rats, are less abundant. Accordingly, the two-way ANOVA indicates that the sex\nfactor is essential for 12 out of 15 estimated metabolites, while PTZ is essential for only 4\nout of 15 metabolites (Figure 3).\nPharmaceuticals 2021 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  7 of 27  \n  \nFigure 3.

Sex-Dependent Effects of Combined Administration of Vitamins B1 and B6 on the Severity of \na Seizure and Its Delayed Consequences  \nIn females, the combined administration of vitamins B1 and B6 24 h before PTZ in-\ncreases the time until the twitching (Tukey \u2019s multiple comparisons test, p = 0.04, ANOVA \n\u201cVitamins\u201d factor p = 0.05; F(1,37) = 4.27), but in males , the parameters of the seizure s \nremain unaffected ( Figure 4A). Thus, the higher the animal susceptibility to the sei-\nzure -inducing action of PTZ ( Figure 1A), the greater the animal sensitivity to the protec-\ntive action of vitamins against such action ( Figure 4A). \nFigure 3.

The content of free amino\nacids and urea is in micromoles per g of tissue. p-values are determined using two-way ANOVA\nwith Tukey\u2019s post hoc test (see Section 4).\nIn summary, both the sex differences in the levels of free amino acids in the rat\nbrain and the amino acid levels themselves respond to the action of PTZ. The sex-speci\ufb01c\nresponses of the brain biochemical parameters (Figures 2 and 3) correspond to the different\nsensitivity of the sexes to PTZ (Figure 1A) and the post-seizure induction of behavioral\ndifferences between the sexes (Figure 1B). In particular, the PTZ-induced changes in the\nsexually dimorphic pattern of the brain amino acids (Figure 3) correspond well to the\nPTZ-induced sex differences in behavior (Figure 1B) and MDH activity (Figure 2).\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 6 of 23\n2.2. Sex-Dependent Effects of Combined Administration of Vitamins B1 and B6 on the Severity of a\nSeizure and Its Delayed Consequences\nIn females, the combined administration of vitamins B1 and B6 24 h before PTZ\nincreases the time until the twitching (Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test, p= 0.04, ANOVA\n\u201cVitamins\u201d factor p= 0.05; F(1,37) = 4.27), but in males, the parameters of the seizures\nremain unaffected (Figure 4A). Thus, the higher the animal susceptibility to the seizure-\ninducing action of PTZ (Figure 1A), the greater the animal sensitivity to the protective\naction of vitamins against such action (Figure 4A).\nPharmaceuticals 2021 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  8 of 27  \n  \nFigure 4 .

When comparing the effects of vitamins in the PTZ-treated\nanimals (Figure 6) to the action of PTZ on the control animals (Figure 3), the partial reversal\nof the PTZ effects by vitamins is remarkable. The PTZ-induced or abrogated sex differences\nin the levels of cerebral glutamate, glutamine and alanine (Figure 3) are returned to the\ncontrol pattern in the vitamin-supplemented animals exposed to PTZ (Figure 6). This is\naccompanied by increases in the levels of glutamate and urea in the vitamin-supplemented\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 8 of 23\nPTZ males vs. those without vitamins (Figure 6), the effects being opposite to those of\nPTZ (Figure 3). However, the PTZ-perturbed sex relationship in the level of aspartate\n(Figure 3 ) is not normalized by the vitamins administration (Figure 6). In the female brain,\nthe vitamins do not return the phenylalanine level (Figure 6) to its control value, which is\ndecreased by PTZ (Figure 3). Moreover, the combined administration of vitamins and PTZ\ninduces additional sex differences in the levels of GABA, histidine, methionine and the\nbranched-chain amino acids isoleucine and leucine (Figure 6), which are not statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant in either the control or the PTZ-treated rats (Figure 3). Thus, the administration\nof vitamins B1 and B6 24 h before PTZ restores sex-dependent levels of some amino acids,\nsimultaneously enhancing the sex differences in the levels of other amino acids. While the\nformer effect of the vitamins administration to the PTZ-treated animals is only observed in\nthe biochemical parameters, the vitamin-induced enhancement of sex differences in the\nbrain levels of GABA, histidine, methionine, isoleucine and leucine corresponds well to the\nenhancement of sex differences in physiological parameters (Figure 4B).\nPharmaceuticals 2021 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  11 of 27  \n  \nFigure 6.

The low level of exploratory\nactivity in the groups of rats receiving the vitamins 0.5 or 2 h before PTZ (Figure 10B) is\nconsistent with the parameters of seizures, indicating that administration of vitamins at\nthese time points sensitizes the female rats to PTZ. Overall, the physiological indicators\nof the delayed effects of a seizure are in good agreement with the pathophysiological\nparameters of the seizure itself, testifying to the facilitation of a seizure after the short-\nterm administration of vitamins prior to PTZ and to a protective effect of the vitamins\nadministered 24 h before a seizure (Figure 10A).\nRemarkably, the administration of vitamins 24 h before PTZ results in signi\ufb01cantly\n(Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test, p= 0.05; ANOVA p= 0.04, F(3,22) = 3.36) lower PLK\nactivity compared to the administration of the vitamins 0.5 h before PTZ (Figure 10B). Thus,\nthe PLK decrease during the long interval between the administration of vitamins and PTZ\nis associated with the protective effect of vitamins against the PTZ-induced seizure.\n3. Discussion\nIn humans, gender differences in epilepsy and underlying molecular mechanisms\nremain a well-known challenge for therapeutic approaches [ 17,30]. The accumulating\ndata point to signi\ufb01cant interactions between the hormonal status and other factors in\nepilepsy [ 17], which should be taken into account to improve the therapy of epilepsy. Not\nonly do steroid hormones and sexually dimorphic neural networks support differential\nsusceptibility of males and females to speci\ufb01c epileptogenic factors, but neurosteroids\ndo as well [ 31\u201333]. The most studied neurosteroids allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone\nand allopregnanolone modulate the function of the GABA Areceptor, thus controlling the\nneural network excitability, which is perturbed in epileptic seizures [ 31]. The estrous cycle\nin sexually mature females represents an associated challenge, requiring more speci\ufb01c\nstudies in females. For instance, the term catamenial epilepsy refers to female seizures with\nperiodic occurrence depending on their menstrual cycle [ 32]. Mostly, estrous-cycle-related\ndifferences in physiological parameters and stress reactions are observed between the\nluteal (metestrus/diestrus) and follicular (proestrus/estrus) phases, which strongly differ\nin the levels of sex hormones [ 34\u201339]. In our model study, only the female rats in the\nluteal phase are included, as they represent the majority under the employed experimental\nconditions. Similar to other studies regarding different parameters [ 34\u201340], we did not\nobserve signi\ufb01cant differences between the diestrus and metestrus rats, owing to which\nthey were pooled together. Based on the strongly different hormonal status of the female\nrats in follicular phase, compared to those in luteal phase [ 34\u201339], it is probable that more\nsexual differences could be revealed between the males and females in follicular phase\nthan were observed in our current work comparing the male rats with the females in luteal\nphase. This important question requires further studies.\nWhile most of the clinical and experimental studies in epilepsy focus on seizures\nthemselves, the delayed consequences of seizures are not at all less important, as the\naccumulation of even minor changes in the brain homeostasis may lead to a vicious\ncycle deteriorating the patients state with time. Employing the PTZ-induced model of\nseizures, we have studied not only the parameters of seizures, but also their physiological\nconsequences and biochemical basis the day after. By comparison of the seizures in the male\nand female rats, we show that the different reaction of the sexes to the seizure-inducing\nand protective factors is not always obvious as signi\ufb01cant effects in each of the group but\nmay be manifested as an induction of sex differences, or, contrarily, as the disappearance of\nsuch differences. Both events obviously result from minor sex-speci\ufb01c changes in opposite\ndirections, which do not reach statistical signi\ufb01cance in each sex. The comparison of the\nmales and females is therefore more powerful to detect the sex-speci\ufb01c effects. Using\nthis comparative analysis, we have characterized induction or abrogation by PTZ and/or\nvitamins of sex differences, absent or pre-existing, correspondingly, in the non-affected\nstate. The data obtained in this work show that such cumulative effects are observed in\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 14 of 23\nphysiological and/or biochemical parameters, being much more pronounced than the\nspeci\ufb01c actions of PTZ and/or vitamins in the female or male rats. For instance, in our\nstudy of the action of vitamins on the PTZ-treated animals (Figure 6), eight statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant ( p\u00140.05 by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test) sex differences in the amino\nacid pro\ufb01les are affected by the vitamins (of those, six arise and two disappear). However,\nthe statistically signi\ufb01cant effects of the vitamins on each sex include only two changes in\nthe male rats and none in the female rats.\nThe seizure-induced sexual differences correspond to the differential susceptibility\nof the sexes to the delayed consequences of a seizure (Figure 4B). Moreover, the seizure-\ninduced sexual dimorphism in the level of glutamate suggests a sex-dependent modi\ufb01-\ncation of further reactivity to the seizure inducer. In this regard, the PTZ-induced sexual\ndimorphism in the brain methionine level also deserves attention, as methionine is a precur-\nsor of a pro-convulsant homocysteine [ 41]. Homocysteine levels are higher in the plasma\nof males compared to females [ 42], but their increase is more dangerous to the female brain\nthan the male brain [ 43]. In the animals without exposure to PTZ, there is no difference\nin the brain methionine level between the males and females (Figure 9). However, the\ndifference tends to arise after PTZ treatment and becomes statistically signi\ufb01cant after the\ncombined treatment with PTZ and vitamins (Figure 6). The resulting levels of methionine\nare higher in females than males, pointing to sex-dependent changes in metabolic pathways\ninvolving homocysteine. Changes in these pathways are known to occur after recurrent\nseizures and antiepileptic drugs, which increase plasma homocysteine levels [41].\nAll together our experiments reveal multiple sex-speci\ufb01c responses to seizures and\ntherapeutic approaches. Such responses are revealed in the action of PTZ, the delayed\nconsequences of a seizure and the action of vitamins B1 and B6. Changes in the brain amino\nacids provide very sensitive indicators of the cumulative physiological responses, while\nthein vitro assays of the brain enzymes reveal the affected parts of metabolic networks.\nCompared to the control rats, PTZ action decreases the brain MDH only in the male rats.\nSuch subtle difference in the functional expression of one out of eleven tested brain enzymes\nof the central metabolism (Figure 2) is accompanied by multiple changes in the brain amino\nacids, including glutamate (Figure 3), which is of utmost signi\ufb01cance in epilepsy.\nThus, delayed consequences of a seizure involve changes in the central metabolism\nof the brain. The dependence of such metabolism on vitamins may result in so-called\nmetabolic epilepsies, often positively responding to administration of vitamins [ 44]. While\nde\ufb01ciencies in vitamins B1 and B6 due to malnutrition have not been considered an issue in\ndeveloped countries for a long time, these states currently occur more and more often as a\nresult of intensi\ufb01ed medical treatments, such as the administration of diuretics, metformin,\nantibiotics, chemotherapy and bariatric surgery [ 13,16,26,45]. Regarding vitamins B1\nand B6, seizures are known to arise due to mutations in proteins of their transport and\nmetabolic transformations, affecting the physiological function of the vitamins [ 46\u201349]. In\nthe diagnosed cases of neonatal epilepsies originating from the pathogenic mutations, the\nurgent administration of the required vitamin is essential to prevent not only seizures,\nbut also the following mental retardation [ 48\u201350]. It should be noted, however, that\nless pathogenic mutations in the proteins of vitamin metabolism may be compensated\nunder normal physiological conditions, yet their pathogenicity may increase under stress\nand/or medical interventions. This feature may underlie interindividual variations in\ndeveloping the vitamins de\ufb01ciencies promoted by pathophysiological conditions. In such\ncases, pharmacological doses/forms of vitamins may be a valuable therapeutic option.\nHowever, unlike vitamin B1, whose high pharmacological doses do not usually have\ndamaging effects [ 13], high doses of vitamin B6 are neurotoxic [ 47] and may induce\nseizures [ 51]. Therefore, in view of our \ufb01nding of the mutual regulation of metabolism\nof vitamins B6 and B1 [ 11], the anti-seizure action of the combined administration of\nboth vitamins is studied in this work. Nevertheless, a potentiating effect of the combined\nadministration of vitamins B1 and B6 on the PTZ-induced seizures is observed in female\nrats upon the vitamins\u2019 administration shortly before PTZ (Figure 10). Only in this animal\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 15 of 23\ngroup have the deadly seizures occurred (see Section 4.4). In the control male rats, the\nvitamins increase anxiety (Figure 7). The negative effects of the combined administration of\nB1 and B6 may be ascribed to the action of vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxal-50-phosphate,\nwhich are known to induce seizures upon intracerebroventricular administration in rats [ 51].\nSuch a view is supported by the transformation of the seizures-sensitizing effect of the\nvitamins administration into a protective one along with downregulation of the brain\nPLK which synthesizes pyridoxal-50-phosphate from pyridoxal (vitamin B6) (Figure 10),\nand increased sex differences in the B6-dependent enzymes GOT and PNPO after the\nvitamins administration to the control animals (Figure 8). The protective effects of the\nvitamins introduced 24 h before PTZ also include the vitamins-induced reversal of the PTZ\neffects on the sex differences in glutamate, glutamine and alanine. As a result, our data\nreveal molecular mechanisms of therapeutic action of vitamins in combating the delayed\nconsequences of seizures, that warrant further studies.\n4.

Pyridoxine-50-phosphate was synthesized from pyridoxal-50-phosphate\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as described previously [ 52]. The solutions were\nprepared in Milli-Q deionized water, the salts used were of the highest purity available.\n4.1. Animals\nThe studies were carried out in Wistar rats obtained from the Russian Federation State\nResearch Center Institute of Biomedical Problems RAS (IBMP)\u2014both males and females,\nweighing 250 to 350 g. The animals were kept under standard conditions in cages with\nfree access to water and food and a light/dark cycle of 12/12 h (the light turned on at\n9 a.m.). The adaptation period to the husbandry conditions was two weeks. The age of\nthe animals at the time of the study was 2.5\u20133.0 months. According to the vaginal smears\ntaken an hour before the start of the experiment [ 53], the female rats were \u201cmetestrus\u201d or\n\u201cdiestrus\u201d. Major contributions of females with these stages of estrous cycle, characterized\nby low levels and minimal \ufb02uctuations of sex hormones [ 54,55], to the experimental animal\nsample was presumably due to the prolonged duration of these stages (together up to\n78 h, i.e., more than 75% of the total duration of the estrous cycle). We did not see any\nsigni\ufb01cant differences between the metestrus or diestrus females, hence the animals were\ncombined. Animals were distributed randomly between experimental groups. Animals\nwere killed by decapitation according to the schemes from Supplementary Figure S1, as\nusage of anesthetics was incompatible with our study of the brain biochemical changes. A\nlong-standing research has established multiple interferences of different anesthetics with\nmetabolic and signaling pathways [ 56\u201363]. In view of strong interactions of anesthetics\nwith the mitochondrial function [ 56,58,59], neurotransmitter levels [ 58,61\u201364] and action of\nneuroprotectants [ 61,64], all studied in our work, euthanasia by decapitation was chosen\nas the most suitable method for our studies on adult animals, in accordance with existing\nrecommendations [ 63\u201365]. Given that the other animals are not in the decapitation room,\ncutting off the head using guillotine (OpenScience, Moscow, Russia) is considered one of\nthe least stressful method to kill the animals [ 63\u201366]. After each use, the guillotine was\nwashed thoroughly with water and ethanol, so that no blood smell could stress another\nanimal. The procedure was done according to recommended protocols [ 63\u201366] as described\nbefore [ 67]. Animal experiments and all the described procedures, including euthanasia\nby decapitation, were approved by Bioethics Committee of Lomonosov Moscow State\nUniversity (protocol number 69-o from 9 June 2016).\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 16 of 23\n4.2.

After PTZ administration, the severity of seizures was visually assessed\naccording to the modi\ufb01ed Racine scale developed for the employed protocol of PTZ\nadministration [ 68] (Table 1) for 15 min in individual cages (OpenScience, Moscow, Russia).\nDuring the visual assessment, there were no more than 4 rats in individual cages (2 with\nPTZ and 2 without PTZ), arranged so as to allow observation of each of them. Scores were\nregistered every minute of the observation, and an epileptic seizure of maximum score was\nnoted for the given minute of observation. If the stages 4\u20135 on the modi\ufb01ed Racine scale\n(tonic or tonic-clonic seizures, Table 1) did not develop within 15 min, PTZ was re-injected\nat the same dose of 25 mg/kg. The procedure was repeated no more than three times, and\nthe total PTZ dose thus did not exceed 75 mg/kg. The total time of the seizure observation\nwas 45 min (Supplementary Figure S1).\nTable 1.

Vitamin Administration\nVitamins B1 (thiamine, 100 mg per kg body weight) and B6 (pyridoxal, 100 mg per kg\nbody weight) were administered intraperitoneally 24 h before the \ufb01rst PTZ administration\nand after the completion of a 45 min follow-up of the PTZ-induced seizures (Supplementary\nFigure S1). In the study of the time-dependence of the vitamins effects, performed on the\nfemale rats only, the separate experimental groups received vitamins at varied intervals\nbefore the \ufb01rst PTZ administration, i.e., either 24 or 2 or 0.5 h, and after completion of a\n45 min follow-up of the PTZ-induced seizures (Supplementary Figure S1). This vitamin\nregimen took into account the results of previous studies on the potential protective effect of\nhigh doses of vitamins both before [ 72] and after [ 24] the exposure to stress, when increased\navailability of vitamins may provide better stabilization and normalization of the metabolic\nstate, respectively [ 73]. Control animals received the injections with equivalent volumes of\nphysiological solution (0.9% NaCl). Since the seizure occurred before the second injection\nof vitamins, only the \ufb01rst injection of vitamins affected the convulsions themselves. Both\nthe \ufb01rst and the second doses of vitamins affected the delayed consequences of a seizure.\nA major part (about 70%) of both vitamins is known to be excreted from the body 24 h\nafter the injection [ 74,75]. However, the injections signi\ufb01cantly increase the internal pool\nof vitamins [ 76] stored in the liver, where concentrations of thiamine diphosphate and B6\nvitamers are higher than in other tissues [14,77].\nAccording to the formula recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/\nGuidances/ucm078932.pdf; accessed on 19 June 2021), the dose of vitamins B1 and B6 used\nin this study on rats (100 mg/kg each of the vitamins) corresponds to a dose of 16 mg/kg,\nor 1 g for an average weight of 60 kg, in humans. No toxic or side effects in humans are\nknown for vitamin B1 at a daily dose of 0.5 g for a month [ 78]; clinically used injections of\nvitamin B1 may be up to 0.5 g three times a day [ 79]. However, high doses of vitamin B6 are\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 17 of 23\nneurotoxic in humans [ 75,80], with 2\u20136 g of vitamin B6 per day resulting in acute sensory\nneuropathies [ 75,81]. Intracerebroventricular administration of pyridoxal-50-phosphate\nand its synthetic analogs led to seizures in rats [ 51]. At the same time, such effects were\nnot reported in patients with various B6-dependent syndromes who received 0.5\u20131.5 g\nof vitamin B6 per day [ 75]. Thus, the dose of vitamins B1 and B6 used in our study are\nwithin the interval of the doses clinically used in megavitamin therapy. In addition, taking\ninto account the inhibition by vitamin B1 of PLK [ 11], which produces the coenzyme form\nof vitamin B6, the co-administration of vitamins used in this study could reduce the B6\nneurotoxicity, potentially linked to production of the coenzyme pyridoxal-50-phosphate by\nPLK.\n4.4.

Assessment of Physiological Parameters\nTo assess the spontaneous behavior of animals in an unfamiliar environment, we used\nthe Open Field test (OpenScience, Moscow, Russia) [ 82]. Standard assays and interpreta-\ntions of the open-\ufb01eld data were in accordance with the published papers [ 83\u201385]. The\nround arena made of polyvinyl chloride with a diameter of 97 cm, surrounded by a wall\nof 42 cm height, was used (OpenScience, Moscow, Russia). The bottom of the arena was\ndivided into the two circles equidistant from each other (the diameter of the smaller circle\nwas 23 cm, the diameter of the larger circle was 60 cm). The ring formed by the larger circle\nand the wall of the \ufb01eld was divided into 12 sectors; the ring formed by the larger and\nsmaller circles was divided into 6 sectors. The animals were put in the center and tested\nin complete silence under the light of a 15 W red lamp for three minutes, assessing the\nfollowing indicators:\n1. locomotor activity\u2014the number of segments passed;\n2. rearing acts\u2014the number of stands on the hind limbs;\n3. central activity\u2014the number of the intersections of the small and central circles plus\nthe number of movements from the walls intersecting the larger circle. In animals\nthat did not move from the center (freezing), this indicator was equal to 0;\n4. total freezing time\u2014time when the active behavior was lacking in all the sectors;\n5. grooming time;\n6. the number of acts of grooming;\n7. the number of defecation acts.\nIn the graphs of Results, the parameters were partly combined as cumulative indices\nfor exploratory activity and anxiety. The exploratory activity summarized the rearing\nacts and central activity; the anxiety summarized freezing and grooming times with the\nnumber of grooming and defecation acts. All parameters used to calculate the cumulative\nindicators were assigned arbitrary units, such as, e.g., 1 s of freezing = 1 a.u.; 1 act of\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 18 of 23\ndefecation = 1 a.u., etc. The employed combinations of parameters to characterize anxiety\nand exploratory activities were based on the studies showing unidirectional change of\nthese parameters [ 83,86\u201388]. All the particular parameters used for the cumulative indexes,\nare presented in Supplementary Figures S2\u2013S5.\nAccording to clinical data, patients with epilepsy have increased risk of sudden death,\nmost probably due to the seizure-perturbed heart rhythms characterized by ECG, hence the\nECG analysis was employed to estimate the cardiological risks [ 27\u201329]. ECG was recorded\nusing cutaneous electrodes (disposable silver chloride electrodes for recording ECG in\nnewborns), attached to the right and left on the ventrolateral surface of the animal\u2019s chest.\nPrior to this, the skin in these areas was degreased with alcohol and the electrodes were\nglued, fastened to the terminals and mounted on a harness of the original design, which\nwas put on the animal. The connector was linked to a biopotential ampli\ufb01er having a\nfrequency range of 10 Hz to 20 kHz. The signal from the electrodes was transmitted to an\nE14-440 analog-to-digital converter (L-Card, Moscow, Russia) connected to a computer.\nThe analog signal was recorded from free-roaming rats using the Powergraph software\n(DISoft LLC, Moscow, Russia), digitized at a frequency of 1 kHz and processed using\nSpike-C3, Average and Ints software (OpenScience, Moscow, Russia).\nThe balance of autonomous regulation of heart rate, representing the relative contribu-\ntion of the sympathetic and parasympathetic components to the activity of the nervous\nsystem, was assessed in accordance with Baevsky et al. [ 89]. The following parameters\nof the heart rate variability were calculated: average RR interval in a sample, ms; dX\u2014\nvariance of RR intervals in a sample, ms; parasympathetic, or relaxation, index of the state\nof the nervous system\u2014RMSSD; sympathetic, or stress, index of the state of the nervous\nsystem\u2014SI [89,90].\n4.6. Preparation of Homogenates of the Rat Cerebral Cortex\nHomogenization of the tissue and sonication of homogenates was carried out accord-\ning to the previously published protocol [67].\n4.7. Preparation of Tissue Extracts and Quanti\ufb01cations of Metabolites\nMethanol-acetate extraction of the rat cerebral cortex and quanti\ufb01cation of its amino\nacids and urea were done as described before [ 25,91]. Brie\ufb02y, frozen cerebral cortices were\nhomogenized in ice-cold methanol, then acetic acid solution was added, and the proteins\nwere precipitated. The sodium-citrate buffer system with a Hitachi L-8800 amino acid ana-\nlyzer was used according to the manufacturer0s User Manual, as described before [25,91].\n4.8. Measurement of Enzymatic Activities\nThe activities of thiamine-diphosphate-dependent enzyme complexes of 2-oxoglutarate\ndehydrogenase and 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase, as well as the activities of GDH, MDH,\nGS and ME were measured as previously described [ 23]. The activity of the pyruvate\ndehydrogenase complex was determined according to a published protocol for the enzyme\nassay in tissue homogenates [ 92]. The activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine\naminotransferase were measured according to the method of Reitman and Frankel [ 93].\nAll of the above activities were assayed in 0.2 mL of the reaction medium spectrophoto-\nmetrically in transparent 96-well microplates, using a Sunrise plate reader (Tecan, Gr\u00f6dig,\nAustria).\nThe activity of PLK was measured using a published assay system with several modi-\n\ufb01cations [ 94]. First, 2\u20138 \u0016L of a rat cerebral cortex homogenate with a protein concentration\nof about 50 mg/mL were added to 0.2 mL of the reaction mixture comprising 50 mM\nKH 2PO4, pH 6.0; 0.1 mM ZnSO 4; 0.2 mM pyridoxal; 2 mM Na 2ATP . The mixture was\nincubated at 37\u000eC for 90 min, followed by the cooling of the plate on ice for 5 min and\nimmediate addition of a cold solution of 6 mM hydroxylamine to a \ufb01nal concentration of\n1 mM. A control medium without ATP was used as a blank. The \ufb02uorescence (ex365 nm\nPharmaceuticals 2021 ,14, 737 19 of 23\n| em450 nm) was measured 150 s after the hydroxylamine addition during 5 min. The\ncalculation of the rate of the PLK reaction was carried out as described [94].\nOur assay of PNPO was based on the enzymatic production of hydrogen peroxide,\nwhich may be detected in complex biological mixtures by Amplex UltraRed (Thermo\nFisher Scienti\ufb01c, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [ 95]. The reaction was carried out at 25\u000eC in 0.2 mL\nof the reaction mixture comprising 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 50 mM KCl; 10 mM NaCl;\n10\u0016Mpyridoxine 50-phosphate; 5 U/mL horseradish peroxidase; 10 \u0016M Amplex UltraRed\n(diluted from 10 mM stock solution in DMSO). To measure the reaction blank, the reaction\nmedium omitting pyridoxine 50-phosphate was used. The reactions were started with\n3\u201315\u0016Lof the rat cerebral cortex homogenate. The \ufb02uorescence (ex560 nm | em590 nm)\nwas measured during the 10 min of the reaction.\nThe \ufb02uorescent assays of PLK and PNPO were done in black microplates using a\nCLARIOStar plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany).\n4.9. Statistical Analysis and Data Presentation\nData were analysed using the GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software\nInc., San Diego, CA, USA). Individual values of the parameters for each animal, their\nmedian, quartiles and values of the minimum and maximum are shown on the graphs.\nStatistical signi\ufb01cance of differences between the two groups was assessed using the\nMann\u2013Whitney U-test. Statistical signi\ufb01cance of differences upon comparison of more than\ntwo experimental groups was assessed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. The statistical signi\ufb01cance at p\u00140.05 is shown on\nthe graphs. The tables below the \ufb01gures show the ANOVA results for the signi\ufb01cance of\nfactors (signi\ufb01cant values of p\u00140.05 are in bold) and their interaction. When mentioned\nin the text, the ANOVA p-values are also supported by the F-values with the degrees of\nfreedom, presented as F(DFn, DFd). In all these cases, the F-values were larger than the\ncorresponding critical values, supporting the signi\ufb01cance of the reported results.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/\n10.3390/ph14080737/s1, Figure S1: Flowchart of physiological experiments in intact rats (A), rats\nreceiving vitamins B1 and B6 (B), rats receiving PTZ without the vitamins (C), rats receiving PTZ with\nthe vitamins (D), Figure S2: Sex-dependent parameters of behavior 24 h after PTZ-induced seizure,\ncompared to the control animals, Figure S3: Sex-dependent effects of the administration of vitamins B1\nand B6 on the behavior 24 h after PTZ-induced seizure, Figure S4: Behavioral effects of administration\nof vitamins B1 and B6 to the control rats, Figure S5: Dependence of behavioral parameters of the\nfemale rats 24 h after the PTZ-induced seizure on the interval between the administration of vitamins\nB1/B6 and PTZ.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V .I.B.; All the co-authors (V .A.A., A.V .G., A.V .A., A.I.B.,\nA.L.K., M.V .M., I.N., M.L.d.S. and V .I.B.) contributed to methodology, validation, formal analysis,\ninvestigation, resources and data curation; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V .A.A. and V .I.B.;\nwriting\u2014review and editing, V .I.B. with all co-authors; visualization, V .A.A. and A.V .G.; supervision,\nV .I.B.; project administration, V .I.B.; funding acquisition, V .I.B.
