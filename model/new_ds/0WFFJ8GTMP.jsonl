Although the total\nnumber of thyroid surgeries has decreased in Germany in the l ast years, the proportion of total\nthyroidectomies (TT) is increasing ( 2). Total thyroidectomy is performed for example in case of\nmalignancy, suspected bilobular or symptomatic nodular goiter or graves\u2019 disease. Hypocalcemia\nTabriz et al. Prophylactic Calcium Supplementation in Thyroidectomy\nis one of the most common complications of bilateral thyroid\nresections with an incidence ranging from 0.3 to 49% ( 3).\nSymptoms of postoperative hypocalcemia can range from mild\nparesthesia and peripheral muscular spasms to laryngospasm\nand life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias ( 4). These symptoms\ndo not only lead to extended hospital stay but also reduces\npatients\u2019 quality of life ( 5,6). Therefore, serum calcium (and)\nparathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are monitored in the early\npostoperative course. Especially, due to the very short half-li fe\nof PTH (3\u20135 mins), early postoperative PTH determination can\nhelp to detect postoperative hypoparathyroidism. PTH levels\n<15 pg/mL at least 20 mins or more following TT might\npredict potential therapy-relevant hypoparathyroidism ( 7,8). In\na recent study, a cut-o\ufb00 PTH value of >19.95 pg/mL during the\nimmediate postoperative period was established for a safe early\ndischargewithoutsupplementationofcalciumandvitaminD( 9).\nDespite this clinically accepted postoperative procedure, ther e\nare no generally accepted postoperative hypoparathyroidism\nmanagement recommendations. Recently, a meta-analysis has\ncon\ufb01rmed the e\ufb00ectiveness of calcium and vitamin D in the\npostoperative course for preventing hypocalcemia-associated\nsymptoms. Yet, a routine supplementation could also lead to\novertreatment in patients with normal serum calcium ( 10). In\none of the few studies dealing with preventive preoperative\ncalcium supplementation prior to total thyroidectomy it was\nshown that preoperative calcium carbonate supplementation\ne\ufb00ectively reduced postoperative biochemical and symptomatic\nhypocalcemia( 11).\nEvidence exist that thyroidectomy can cause signi\ufb01cant\nhypomagnesaemia,possiblycorrelatingwiththedevelopmento f\nhypocalcemia ( 1,12\u201314). Therefore, postoperative monitoring\nafter thyroidectomy, should include controlling both, ser um\ncalciumandmagnesium.\nThis background provides the motivation for this study,\nwhichaimstoinvestigatethequalityoflifeandthedevelopm ent\nof clinical hypocalcemia in relation to preoperative calcium\nand magnesium administration. We want to investigate\nwhether a routine preoperative dietary supplementation of\ncalcium and magnesium in\ufb02uences patients\u2019 outcome with\nregard to hypocalcemia-associated symptoms and quality\nof life in order to reduce the risk of post-thyroidectomy\nhypocalcemia and to improve patient\u2019s quality of life.\nThis could potentially reduce hospital length of stay and\nmedicalexpenses.\nThe primary aim of this study is to investigate the in\ufb02uence\nof preoperative calcium and magnesium supplementations\nstarting 2 weeks prior to surgery on quality of life measured\nby the ThyPRO-39 questionnaire over a time interval of\n2 weeks prior to 6 weeks post-surgery in a randomized\ncontrolledtrial.\nThe secondary aim is to learn how the aforementioned\nsupplementation may in\ufb02uence the development of clinical and\nbiochemical hypocalcemia. In addition, the ThyPRO-39 and the\nEQ-5D-5L questionnaires outcomes should be compared at the\ntimeofhospitaldischarge.\nFIGURE 1 | Study \ufb02ow chart.\nMETHODS\nTrial Design\nWe propose a prospective randomized controlled intervention\nstudy with a postoperative follow-up of 6 weeks ( Figure1;\nTable1).\nStudy Setting\nThe monocentric study will be conducted at a DGAV (Deutsche\nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie; German\nSociety for General and Visceral Surgery) certi\ufb01ed center f or\nthyroidandparathyroidsurgeryinaGermanuniversityhospit al\nforvisceralsurgery.Thehospitalperformsmorethan350thyr oid\nsurgeriesperyear,ofwhichabout100areTTs.\nEligibility Criteria\nInclusioncriteria:\n\u2022Adultpatients( >18years)\n\u2022ScheduledforTT\nFrontiers in Surgery | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2022 | Volume 8 | Article 758205\nTabriz et al.

Prophylactic Calcium Supplementation in Thyroidectomy\nIngestion will begin 2 weeks preoperatively. The comparison\ngroup (control group; CG) will receive no nutritional\nsupplements. The chosen supplementation period allows to\nbuild-up signi\ufb01cantly higher calcium and magnesium levels in\nIG-patientscomparedtoCG-patients.\nPatients assigned to the IG will receive calcium carbonate 3\n\u00d7500mg/d(CalciumSandoz R/circlecopyrt500mg,Hexal)andmagnesium\noxide1\u00d7375mg/d(Magnetrans R/circlecopyrt375mg,StadaVital).\nCriteria for Discontinuing or Modifying\nAllocated Interventions\nOne week after having started supplementation, IG-patients wi ll\nbe contacted viaphone to evaluate their well-being and ask for\nany side e\ufb00ects. If patients report any intervention-related s ide\ne\ufb00ects (e.g., diarrhea), patients may reduce the dose or stop\ningestion.Thosepatientswillbeexcludedfromtheanalysis.\nStrategies to Improve Adherence to\nInterventions\nTheplannedphonecallismeanttoimproveadherence.\nRelevant Concomitant Care Permitted or\nProhibited During the Trial\nNotapplicable.\nProvisions for Post-trial Care\nSince the supplementation dosage is within the range of\nrecommended calcium and magnesium uptake, no harm from\ntrial participation is expected.

Intraoperatively, the macroscopic view of the\nparathyroid glands and description of structure and blood\n\ufb02ow are required. If the lower parathyroid glands are not\nin loco typico, an explicit representation is not necessary.\nIn the case of an accidentally removed parathyroid gland or\ninsu\ufb03cient blood supply, the gland is removed, cut into small\ncubes and autologously reimplanted in a muscle pocket of\nthe sternocleidomastoid muscle. The a\ufb00ected patient is then\nexcludedfromthestudy.\nPostoperatively, all patients are routinely monitored on\nthe intermediate care unit, especially with regard to potentia l\npostoperative hemorrhage. PTH and calcium will be checked\non \ufb01rst postoperative day. Depending to the measured PTH\nlevel (norm 15\u201365 pg/ml) calcium with or without Alfacalcido l\n(Einsalpha R/circlecopyrt, LEO) will be supplemented, regardless of group\na\ufb03liation( Table2).\nBefore patient\u2019s discharge, the EQ-5D-5L and ThyPRO-\n39 will be completed for a third time. Patient\u2019s discharge is\nplanned on the 2nd or 3rd postoperative day depending on his\ncondition. The histological result will be available withi n 24\u2013\n48h postoperatively.

In\ncase of PTH <15 pg/ml, the therapeutic goal of vitamin\nD-, calcium- and magnesium-substitution is to achieve a\nserum calcium level in the lower normal range (2.0\u20132.2\nmmol/l). At the beginning of the substitution, calcium\nand phosphate values should be determined at 2-weekly\nintervals and vitamin D dose should be adjusted by 10\u2013\n20% depending on the calcium level. The laboratory exams\nwill be repeated after 6 months to determine a potential\npersistenthypoparathyroidism.\nFrontiers in Surgery | www.frontiersin.org 4 January 2022 | Volume 8 | Article 758205\nTabriz et al.

Currently, in case of total\nthyroidectomy serum calcium concentration and PTH levels\nare monitored postoperatively followed by needs-based calci um\nand vitamin D supplementation. Through this regime, transien t\nhypocalcemia can be adequately treated in most cases. PTH\ncan already been determined 20 mins after TT and cut-o\ufb00\nvalues of <15 pg/mL or <20 pg/mL, also depending on the\nassay used, can help to predict the likelihood of therapy-\nrelevantpostoperativehypoparathyroidism( 7\u20139).Duetoclinical\npractical application, we decide to determine PTH and calcium\nlevelonthe\ufb01rstpostoperativedayandtosubstitutecalciumw ith\nor without vitamin D depending on the PTH value. Thereby,\nsupplementation of calcium and vitamin D can be applied to\nfacilitateasafeearlydischargeleadingtocostsavings,f orinstance\nby reducing inpatient treatment time, and improved patients\u2019\nsatisfactionandqualityoflife.\nThere is ample evidence, including meta-analysis and\nsystematic reviews, con\ufb01rming the e\ufb00ectiveness of early\npostoperative calcium and vitamin D supplementation on\npostoperative outcome after TT ( 10,16). Yet, only few\nstudies have examined the role of a prophylactic preoperative\ncalcium (and) vitamin D supplementation on postoperative\nhypocalcemia.Inaprospectivestudywithpre-andpostoperative\ncalcium and vitamin D supplementation in 50 patients\nundergoing TT, the incidence of symptomatic hypocalcemia\nwas 6% and of laboratory hypocalcemia it was 10%. However,\nthat study did not include a no control group ( 17). Jaan\net al. (18) examined 46 patients who underwent total or\nnear TT in a randomized controlled trial. They randomly\ndivided the patients into two groups, one group ( n=\n24) receiving calcium and vitamin D 7 days pre- and 7\ndays postoperatively, and one group did not receive such\nsupplementation. They concluded that routine vitamin D and\ncalcium supplementation can signi\ufb01cantly reduce postoperativ e\nhypocalcemia. However, in that study perioperative PTH\nlevels and vitamin D de\ufb01ciency were not measured and\ndi\ufb00erent thyroid diseases (thyroid cancer, graves\u2019 disease and\nnodular goiter) were included. In graves\u2019 disease, it is wel l\nknown that patients have much higher rates of symptomatichypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy than with other\ndiagnosis due to, for example, the \u201chungry bone syndrome\u201d\nand blood supply disturbances of the parathyroid glands\n(19\u201321). Oltmann et al. ( 11) examined the e\ufb00ect of 2 weeks\nof preoperative calcium supplementation (3 grams/day) on\npostoperative hypocalcaemia in comparison to a historic\nmatched non-supplemented group with graves\u2019 disease. They\nstated that calcium supplementation before TT for graves\u2019\ndisease signi\ufb01cantly reduces biochemical and symptomatic\npostoperativehypocalcemia.\nIt has to be pointed out that for comparison of di\ufb00erent\nthyroid diseases such as graves\u2019 disease, nodular goiter,\nor cancer, subgroup analysis should be performed as the\npathophysiology of postoperative hypoparathyroidism depends\non the primary diagnosis and on the extent of surgery\n(i.e., TT plus lymph node dissection). In order to avoid\nsurgery-related hypoparathyroidism due to central or lateral\nlymph node dissection, only TT for benign diseases such as\nsymptomatic nodular goiter or graves\u2019 disease is included in\nourtrial.\nStudies on the role of preoperative vitamin D level on early\npostoperative hypocalcemia reveal contradictory results. On t he\none hand, low preoperative vitamin D and low postoperative\nparathyroid hormone levels were seen as predictors for the\ndevelopment of hypocalcemia ( 22,23). On the other hand, these\nbiochemical parameters could not be detected as a risk factor i n\nother studies ( 9,24,25). Therefore, for our planned study, the\nin\ufb02uence of vitamin D level on postoperative hypocalcemia is\nalsoregarded.\nWe assume that a prophylactic dietary supplementation with\ncalcium and magnesium, which could easily be implemented\nin the preoperative setting, could potentially help to avoid or\nreduce hypocalcemia-associated symptoms and improve quality\nof life. Due to lacking data concerning the optimal duration f or\na preoperative supplementation period, we have pragmatically\nused the data of Oltmann et al. ( 11). Also, the amount of\ncalcium and magnesium to be administered could be subject to\ndiscussion.Wedecidedtoprescribe1500mgcalciumand375mg\nmagnesium that is not harmful for patients, as potential side\ne\ufb00ectsarerareandassociatedwithmuchhigherdoses,accord ing\ntotheEFSA-recommendations( 26,27).\nFollowing the here presented preoperative procedure may\nbe useful to prepare patients scheduled for thyroidectomy and\ncan possibly reduce disease-speci\ufb01c costs and improve patient\u2019s\nqualityoflife.\nTRIAL STATUS\nThis protocol corresponds to version 3.0 of the study\ndesign, which has been positively reviewed by the Medical\nEthics Committee (No. 2017-105).
