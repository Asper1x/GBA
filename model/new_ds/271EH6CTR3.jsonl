This \nstudy aimed to evaluate the possible effects of the dietary supplementation of Lactobacillus casei-fermented mixture of red \nrice and aromatic ginger (FERMIX) on growth, blood profiles, intestinal bacterial content, and morphological measurements of broilers.\nMaterials and Methods: Two hundred broiler chicks were allotted to four groups with five replications, including CONTROL \n(chicks provided with basal feed), FERMIX025 (basal feed supplemented with 0.25% FERMIX), FERMIX050  (0.50% \nFERMIX), and FERMIX100  (1.00% FERMIX). FERMIX is an anaerobic fermentation product from a mixture of red rice \nflour and aromatic ginger using L. casei. Blood, organs, digesta, and carcass were collected on day 35.\nResults: Final body weight, weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio did not differ (p>0.05) across treatments. \nFERMIX at 0.5% increased (p<0.05) spleen relative weight. Liver weight was lower (p<0.05) in broilers fed with 1% FERMIX. The liver weight linearly reduced (p<0.05) with the increased FERMIX levels. FERMIX at 0.25% elevated (p<0.05) broiler drumsticks\u2019 yield than that in other groups. Erythrocytes, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, and plasma total protein levels were quadratically higher (p<0.05) in FERMIX050 treated than in other groups. Increased FERMIX levels resulted in a linear decrease (p=0.08) in ileal lactose-negative Enterobacteriaceae  counts. Villi height/crypt depth (CD) \nratio was quadratically higher (p<0.05) in the duodenum of broiler supplemented with 0.5% FERMIX. The jejunal CD was quadratically lower (p<0.05) in FERMIX050 than in other groups.\nConclusion: Although it did not influence growth, dietary FERMIX, especially at 0.5%, improved immune competencies, \nphysiological conditions, and health of broilers\u2019 intestine.\nKeywords: broiler, fermentation, health, phytogenic, prebiotic, probiotic.\nIntroduction\nBroiler chicken is an essential sector of the \nanimal protein supply chain and a significant con -\ntributor to the Indonesian economy. However, with \nthe prohibition on antibiotic growth promoter (AGP) \nusage in feed, the broiler industry has begun facing \nsustainability issues. Continuous AGP usage can lead \nto the establishment of antibiotic resistance and det -\nrimentally impact consumer health [1]. Literature suggests that adding feed additives to broiler feed can help them grow faster and stay healthier. The use of \nprobiotics as a feed additive reduces the number of pathogenic bacteria in broiler intestines and improves \nfeed digestibility, resulting in a favorable effect on the growth rate [2,3]. Prebiotics are another feed additives that can help probiotics function better in boosting \nthe population of non-pathogenic bacteria in broiler \nchicken intestines [1]. In addition to probiotics and \nprebiotics, studies have documented the potential of \nherbal plants as feed additives for broiler chickens due to their contents of antioxidants, antimicrobials, and immunostimulants [4].\nLactobacillus casei is a Gram-positive bacteria \nwidely employed as a probiotic for broiler chick -\nens [5]. These bacteria can maintain the microbial \nbalance, improving the digestive and absorptive func -\ntions of broiler intestines. In addition, L. casei can \nmodulate the immune response of broilers [5]. In addi -\ntion to being a probiotic, L. casei is extensively used \nas a fermentation starter in the feed industry [6]. In \nsome countries, including Indonesia, red rice ( Oryza \nsativa  L.) is a popular cereal, with carbohydrates Copyright: Astuti, et al. Open Access.

In addition to antho -\ncyanins, red rice contains non-starch polysaccharides \nand resistant starch, which may act as prebiotics to \nhelp probiotic microbes proliferate [8,9]. In the case \nof resistant starch, Ashwar et al.  [10] reported that \nresistant starch derived from rice starch is an effective \ndelivery carrier for oral probiotic administration. In \naddition to being a prebiotic, red rice might be used \nto deliver L. casei  to broiler chickens. Aromatic gin -\nger (Kaempferia galanga  L.) is a Kaempheria  species \nwidely used in traditional medicine worldwide [11]. \nThe rhizome of K. galanga  contains several phar -\nmacologically active compounds, including phen -\nylpropanoids, flavanols, and terpenoids [12]. With \nantimicrobial activity [12,13], antioxidants [14], and \nanti-inflammatory activities [14], K. galanga  rhizome \nmay be exploited as a phytogenic feed additive for \nbroilers. According to a recent study, fermentation \nenhances the bioavailability of bioactive components \n(such as polyphenols) and the synthesis of health-pro -\nmoting products [15]. \nAt present, the use of L. casei -fermented blends \nof red rice and aromatic ginger (FERMIX) in broiler \nchickens has never been revealed. This study aimed \nto evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of \nL. casei -fermented mixture of red rice and aromatic \nginger on growth performance, blood profiles, intes -\ntinal bacterial content, and morphological measure -\nments of broilers. It was hypothesized that feeding \nFERMIX could improve broilers\u2019 growth perfor -\nmance, physiological conditions, and intestinal health.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthical approval\nThe in vivo  study was approved by the Animal \nEthics Committee of the Faculty of Animal and \nAgricultural Sciences, Universitas Diponegoro \n(No. 57-08/A3/KEP/FPP).\nStudy period and location\nThe in vivo  study was conducted during April and \nMay 2021 at the Faculty of Animal and Agricultural \nSciences, Universitas Diponegoro, Semarang, Central \nJava, Indonesia.\nPreparation of dietary supplements\nFERMIX production was modified from \nMangisah et al.  [16]. Briefly, the pure L. casei  isolate \nwas rejuvenated on Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) \nagar and anaerobically incubated for 2 days at 38\u00b0C. \nSkim milk (20 g) was diluted in 180-mL distilled \nwater and swirled until homogenous as a growth \nmedium for bacteria (source of lactose). The L. casei  \nisolates (two plates) were harvested with skim milk \n(200 mL) and incubated at 38\u00b0C for 2 days in anaer -\nobic conditions. To produce FERMIX, 50-g brown \nrice flour and 50-g aromatic ginger were mixed and \nplaced in an anaerobic jar, dissolved in 200-mL skim \nmilk containing L. casei  (as prepared previously), \nand swirled until homogenous. The mixture was then incubated at 38\u00b0C for 2 days under anaerobic \nconditions. The mixture was then sun-dried after \nfermentation, obtained for proximate and microbi -\nological analysis. The proximate analysis was con -\nducted according to the standard method described \nby Association of Official Analytical Chemists [17]. \nThe rest of the product was stored at 4\u00b0C until use for \nin vivo  experiment. The proximate analysis showed \nthat the supplement contained (on a dry matter basis) \n11.4% moisture, 11.5% crude protein, 1.86% crude \nfat, 1.96% crude fiber, and 4.45% ash. Following \nthe anaerobic incubation on MRS agar for 2 days at \n38\u00b0C, the supplement contained lactic acid bacteria \n(LAB) of 6.82\u00d71013 cfu/g.\nIn vivo  experiments\nTwo hundred Lohmann broiler chicks were \ncommunally grown in brooding cages with com -\nmercial feed starting when they arrived at the broiler \nhouse. On day 8, the chicks (unsexed; body weight \nof 169.76\u00b11.74 g; means\u00b1standard deviation) were \ndivided into four groups of dietary treatments with \nfive replicates/pens, each with ten chicks. The dietary \ngroups included CONTROL (broiler chicks pro -\nvided with basal feed), FERMIX025 (broiler chicks \nprovided with basal feed supplemented with 0.25% \nFERMIX), FERMIX050 (broiler chicks provided \nwith basal feed supplemented with 0.50% FERMIX), \nand FERMIX100 (broiler chicks provided with \nbasal feed supplemented with 1.00% FERMIX). The \nFERMIX was added (\u201con top\u201d) to basal feeds at the \nend of the mixing process. The mixing of feeds was \nconducted manually, and to achieve a homogeneous \nmixture, approximately 20-kg feed ingredients were \nmixed for every batch. The basal feeds were formu -\nlated ( Table -1) [18] in mash form as starter and fin -\nisher feed when the chicks were 8-21 and 22-35 days \nold, respectively. The feed was formulated to comply \nwith the nutritional requirement of chicks during the \nstarter [19] and finisher [20] periods. From arrival to \nday 7, the birds were offered commercial pre-starter \nfeed containing 23.0% crude protein, 5.0% crude fat, \n5.0% crude fiber, and 7.0% ash (according to feed \nlabel). Feed and drinking water was offered ad libitum  \nthroughout the study period. Chickens were housed in \nan open-sided broiler house with plastic curtains, light \nbulbs, and fans to manually control the temperature \nand humidity inside the broiler house. The temperature \nwas maintained at 28-30\u00b0C and humidity at 80-85%. \nLighting was provided to the chickens throughout the \nday (24 h) during the study.\nRecording of feed consumption and weighing of \nbody weight were conducted weekly. Blood samples \nwere collected from veins of the chicken wings (two \nchicks per pen/10 chicks for each treatment group) \non day 35 and placed in a vacutainer tube containing \nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. After blood collec -\ntion, chickens (one chick per pen) were slaughtered, \nfeathered, and dissected. Then, the internal organs \nVeterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 820\nAvailable at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.15/April-2022/1.pdfwere removed and weighed empty. To count the num -\nber of bacteria in the intestine, researchers obtained \nsamples from the ileum and cecum. Each 2 cm section \nof the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was removed \nand placed in a tube filled with 10% buffered forma -\nlin to assess intestinal morphology. Total carcass and \ncarcass proportion were also determined in this study. \nBriefly, the carcass was weighed after the feathers, \nhead, feet, and giblet were removed. Following that, \nthe carcass proportions (breast, wings, thigh, drum -\nstick, and back) were determined. The total carcass \nwas calculated using the following equation: (carcass \nweight [g]/live bird weight [g])\u00d7100. The carcass pro -\nportion was calculated using the following formula: \n(cut weight [g]/carcass weight [g])\u00d7100.\nAs previously described by Isroli et al. [21], the \ndilution flask method was employed to determine full \nblood counts in this study. A  burker chamber was used \nto count corpuscles and compute the numbers of eryth -\nrocytes and leukocytes. Hematocrit levels were calcu -\nlated using the microhematocrit method. Differential \nleukocytes were counted using a light microscope \nwith an immersion lens. The coverslip procedure \nwas utilized during the preparation of blood smears. \nThe measurement of total protein in the plasma was conducted as described by Bianchi-Bosio [22] using \nthe biuret method. In principle, the cupric ion reacts \nwith protein in an alkaline environment to form a pur -\nple complex. The absorbance of this complex is pro -\nportional to the sample\u2019s protein concentration.\nSugiharto et al. [23] described the bacterial pop -\nulation in the intestine was measured. The amount of \ncoliform and lactose negative Enterobacteriaceae  was \nassessed as red and colorless colonies on MacConkey \nagar (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) after a 24 h \naerobic incubation at 38\u00b0C. Coliform and lactose-neg -\native Enterobacteriaceae  were summed to determine \nEnterobacteriaceae . The amount of LAB on De MRS \nagar (Merck KGaA) was estimated after anaerobic \nincubation at 38\u00b0C for 48 h. The histological measure -\nment of the small intestinal segment was conducted as \noutlined by Tun\u00e7 et al. [24]. Staining of 5-m intestinal \nslices was performed using hematoxylin and eosin. \nThe villi heights (VH) and crypt depths (CD) were \nmeasured using an optical microscope connected to a \ndigital camera. The average VH and CD were calcu -\nlated using five measurements for each bird.\nStatistical analysis\nOne-way analysis of variance (one-way \nANOV A, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences \n[SPSS] 16.0 version; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) \nwas used to statistically assess the experiment\u2019s data, \nwhich was based on a completely randomized design. \nThe Duncan multi-range test was used after a signif -\nicant effect of treatments was detected. In addition, \nthe influence of additives at different levels in feeds \nwas determined using an orthogonal polynomial con -\ntrast test for linear and quadratic effects. Before the \nANOV A test, the homogeneity tests were conducted \nto confirm that the populations had the same distri -\nbution (normal distribution). A  significant effect was \nconsidered when p<0.05. When 0.05\u2264p<0.10 was \nobserved, the tendency was considered.\nResults and Discussion\nGrowth performance of broilers\nImprovement in growth has been observed in \nbroilers with dietary administration of probiotics, \nprebiotics, and herbal products [1,16]. In contrast to \nthe previous study, data obtained in this investigation \nexhibited no FERMIX effect at various levels in diets \non broiler chicken productivity indicators (p>0.05). \nThe regression test further showed no linear impact \n(p>0.05) of treatments on the growth performance \nof broilers ( Table -2). In line with the present results, \nFajardo et al.  [6] found no effect of probiotic L. casei  \non broiler chickens\u2019 growth, feed consumption, and \nfeed conversion ratio. Likewise, Rehman et al.  [25] \nshowed no influence of multistrain probiotics (mix -\nture of Lactobacillus plantarum , Enterococcus \nfaecium , Lactobacillus rhamnosus , Candida pin -\ntolepesii , Aspergillus oryzae,  and Bifidobacterium \nbifidum ) on growth, feed consumption, and feed effi -\nciency of broilers during day 0-35 of the experiment.

[25]. In addition, \nSarangi et al.  [26] reported no influences of dietary \ninclusion of prebiotic (mannan-oligosaccharides), \nprobiotic ( L. plantarum , Lactobacillus bulgaricus , \nBifidobacterium bifidus , Streptococcus faecium , and \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae ), and synbiotic (mixture \nof L. bulgaricus , S. faecium , L. plantarum , S. cere -\nvisiae,  B. bifidus,  and mannan-oligosaccharides) on \nfinal weight, weight gain, feed consumption, and feed \nconversion of broilers during the rearing for 6 weeks. \nDisparities in results between studies are likely due \nto differences in probiotic species and strains, pre -\nbiotic types and sources, doses of probiotics and \nprebiotics included in feeds, and experimental con -\nditions. [16,26]. In the case of K. galanga , research \non the utilization of this herbal plant as a broiler \ngrowth promoter remains lacking. Indeed, in terms \nof the efficacy of dietary herbal supplementation on \ngrowth performance, the growth-promoting effect of \nherbal products may be highly dependent on the types \nand natures of herbs used and the amounts given to \nchicks [27,28].\nInternal organs of broilers\nThe current investigation showed that dietary \nFERMIX, particularly at 0.5% of feed, enhanced \n(p<0.05) chicken spleen weight ( Table -3). The \nincreased spleen weight (relative to live body weight) \nis mostly associated with the improved immune \nresponse of broilers. In an earlier study, Sikandar \net al.  [29] documented an increase in spleen relative \nweight with the inclusion of probiotic Bacillus sub -\ntilis, an indicator of the improved immune responses \nin disease-free broilers. Consistent with this, Salam \net al.  [30] documented broiler\u2019s increased spleen rel -\native weight with supplementation of black cumin \npowder. In addition to the Bursa of fabricius  and thy -\nmus, the spleen is the vital immune organ responsi -\nble for the orientation and maturation of the immune \ncell. In healthy animals, the increased immune organ \nweight is attributed to enhanced immune cell pro -\nliferation, which indicates better immune compe -\ntencies [31]. According to Sikandar et al.  [29], the higher spleen weight may result from amplified B \nand T lymphocytes. Here, the capability of the pro -\nbiotic microorganism in modulating the immune \nresponse of broilers could be the reason for the \nincreased spleen relative weight in broilers. In line \nwith this, the potential of prebiotics and herbal prod -\nucts in modulating the immune responses and intesti -\nnal bacterial populations [1] contribute to the higher \nrelative weight of the spleen in broilers. Data in the \ncurrent work showed that relative liver weight was \nlower (p<0.05) in broilers fed with 1% FERMIX in \ndiet than that in other birds ( Table -3). The rationale \nbehind this condition was unknown, but it seemed \nthat the elevated levels of fiber in diets with the \nincreasing FERMIX were responsible for the lower \nliver weight. These inferences were supported by the \northogonal polynomial contrast test for linear effect, \nshowing that the liver weight decreased (p<0.05) \nwith the increased levels of FERMIX in broiler diets. \nPreviously, Mohiti-Asli et al.  [32] documented that \ndietary fiber reduced liver weight, mainly due to the \ndecreased fatty acid synthesis and thus accumulation \nof lipid in the liver. The orthogonal polynomial con -\ntrast test for quadratic effects revealed that broilers \nfed 0.25% FERMIX had a tendency (p=0.07) to have \na higher relative heart weight. Although the exact \ncause of this condition remains undetermined, the \nhigher metabolic rate in broilers due to FERMIX \ntreatment may increase the heart muscle activity and \nconsequently heart weight. However, this inference \nshould be treated with caution because the higher \nheart relative weight was not found in FERMIX050 \nand FERMIX100 birds.\nCarcass traits of broilers\nIn this study, it was discovered that including \nFERMIX in the feed, especially at 0.25%, enhanced \n(p<0.05) the proportion of broiler drumsticks com -\npared to the other treatments ( Table -4). This finding \nindicated that at 0.25% of diet, FERMIX was able to \nincrease the protein synthesis in broilers. Data regard -\ning the plasma total protein confirmed this inference, \nat which dietary FERMIX increased the concentration \nof the total protein plasma of broilers ( Table -5). It was \nmost likely that bioactive components in FERMIX, \nincluding probiotics, prebiotics, and phytogenic, \ncaused improved protein digestibility and utilization Table -2: Growth performance of broiler chickens.\nItems CONTROL FERMIX025 FERMIX050 FERMIX100 SEM p-value\nA L Q\nFinal BW, g/bird 1501 1505 1604 1512 24.9 0.44 0.57 0.35\nBW gain, g/bird 1329 1338 1435 1342 24.8 0.42 0.46 0.32\nFeed intake, g/bird 2699 2807 2791 2763 35.1 0.74 0.60 0.37\nFCR 2.03 2.10 1.95 2.09 0.04 0.61 0.96 0.69\nBW=Body weight, FCR=Feed conversion ratio, CONTROL=Broiler chicks provided with basal feed, FERMIX025=Basal feed \nsupplemented with 0.25% FERMIX, FERMIX050=Basal feed supplemented with 0.50% FERMIX, FERMIX100=Basal feed \nsupplemented with 1.00% FERMIX, A=Analysis of variance, L=Orthogonal polynomial contrasts test for linear effects, \nQ=Orthogonal polynomial contrasts test for quadratic effects, SEM=Standard error of the means\nVeterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 822\nAvailable at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.15/April-2022/1.pdf[16], resulting in increased protein synthesis and mus -\ncle deposition.

In line with \nerythrocytes, the values of hemoglobin and packed \ncell volume were also quadratically higher (p<0.05) \nin broilers administered 0.25 and 0.5% FERMIX in \ndiets ( Table -5). Given the key role of erythrocytes \ncontaining hemoglobin in transporting and delivering \noxygen for cellular activity, greater erythrocyte val -\nues may be considered to enhance the rate of energy \nproduction in the cells, resulting in a positive effect \non broiler growth performance [33]. Although statisti -\ncally insignificant, the fact that broilers fed with 0.5% \nFERMIX gained more weight than those in the control \ngroup supported this inference. Probiotic microorgan -\nisms enhance the values of erythrocytes and packed \ncell volume of broilers in Shah et al.  [34]. Likewise, \ndietary administration of mannan oligosaccharide \nincreased the levels of erythrocytes and packed cell \nvolume in the blood of turkey, as reported by Cetin \net al.  [35]. In addition, a recent study highlighted that \nthe mixture of garlic and Lactobacillus acidophilus  \ncould increase the levels of erythrocytes and packed \ncell volume of broilers in the study by Sunu et al. [36]. \nThe mechanism by which FERMIX increased the val -\nues of erythrocytes and packed cell volume of broilers \nremains unclear. However, it was most likely that the \ncontent of probiotic, prebiotic, and phytogenic com -\nponents in FERMIX improved protein digestibility \nand utilization, increasing the availability of protein \nused for erythrocyte synthesis. The active compounds \nin FERMIX, particularly herb ( K. galanga ), may also \ndeal with the stress condition, probably causing eryth -\nrocyte cell lysis during the rearing [33]. Altogether, \nthe protective and erythropoiesis-promoting effect of \nFERMIX were responsible for the higher erythrocytes \nand packed cell volume of broiler in this study. Plasma \ntotal protein concentration was greater (p<0.05) in \nFERMIX treated than in the control broiler in this trial. \nIndeed, the increased graded levels of FERMIX were \naccompanied by the linear and quadratic increased (p<0.05) values of plasma total protein. In most sit -\nuations, the increased plasma total protein values \nmay represent the increased protein synthesis in the \nliver, which is used for broiler growth [37]. As men -\ntioned above, the improved protein digestibility and \nutilization due to FERMIX administration seemed to \nbe attributed to the increased liver protein synthesis \nproducing an increased concentration of blood total \nprotein.\nIntestinal bacterial counts and morphology of \nbroilers\nData on the numbers of coliform, lactose-neg -\native Enterobacteriaceae , Enterobacteriaceae , \nLAB, and LAB to coliform ratio in the ileal and \ncecal digesta are presented in Table -6. In general, \ndietary interventions had no influence (p>0.05) on \nthese above selected bacterial counts, both in the \nileum and cecum. However, increased amounts \nof FERMIX in broiler diets caused a linear \ndecrease (p=0.08) in the number of lactose-nega -\ntive Enterobacteriaceae  in the ileum. Considering \nthe potential pathogenicity of lactose-negative \nEnterobacteriaceae , the decrease in such a bac -\nterial population may be beneficial for broilers\u2019 \nhealth condition. The antibacterial properties of \nprobiotics, prebiotics, and herbal products [1,5,12] \nin FERMIX were most likely to decrease the lac -\ntose-negative Enterobacteriaceae  proliferation in \nthe ileum of broiler in this investigation.\nObservation on the duodenum, jejunum, and \nileum segments revealed no substantial influence \n(p>0.05) of feeding FERMIX on the intestinal mor -\nphology of broilers. The increased levels of FERMIX \nin diets did not linearly alter VH, CD, and VH to CD \nratio (VH/CD) of the intestine ( Table -7). However, \nthere was a trend (p=0.09) that VH/CD was higher \nin the duodenum of broilers supplemented with 0.5% \nFERMIX. In addition, the orthogonal polynomial \ncontrast test revealed that the VH/CD in FERMIX050 \nTable -6: Selected intestinal bacterial population of broiler chickens.\nItems (log cfu/g) CONTRL FERMIX025 FERMIX050 FERMIX100 SEM p-value\nA L Q\nIleum\nColiform 7.20 7.58 5.86 7.69 0.34 0.22 0.93 0.29\nLNE 8.24 7.26 6.16 6.16 0.45 0.32 0.08 0.59\nEnterobacteriaceae 8.22 7.94 6.16 7.95 0.42 0.30 0.49 0.22\nLAB 10.6 10.4 10.3 11.4 0.19 0.20 0.18 0.11\nLAB/coliform ratio 1.52 1.41 1.83 1.53 0.08 0.27 0.52 0.53\nCecum\nColiform 7.91 7.57 7.55 6.76 0.24 0.39 0.12 0.64\nLNE 8.35 6.83 7.88 6.90 0.39 0.46 0.36 0.74\nEnterobacteriaceae 8.76 8.13 7.99 7.64 0.29 0.62 0.21 0.82\nLAB 10.9 10.8 10.5 9.91 0.28 0.63 0.24 0.61\nLAB/coliform ratio 1.37 1.45 1.45 1.51 0.06 0.91 0.50 0.96\ncfu=Colony -forming unit, LNE=Lactose-negative Enterobacteriaceae , LAB=Lactic acid bacteria, CONTROL=Broiler \nchicks provided with basal feed, FERMIX025=Basal feed supplemented with 0.25% FERMIX, FERMIX050=Basal feed \nsupplemented with 0.50% FERMIX, FERMIX100=Basal feed supplemented with 1.00% FERMIX, A=Analysis of variance; \nL=Orthogonal polynomial contrasts test for linear effects, Q=Orthogonal polynomial contrasts test for quadratic effects, \nSEM=Standard error of the means\nVeterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 824\nAvailable at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.15/April-2022/1.pdfwas quadratically higher (p<0.05) than in other birds. \nA higher VH/CD of the duodenum is attributed to the \nenhanced nutrient absorption capacity of broilers. In \nthis study, the higher duodenal VH/CD of broilers \nsupplemented with 0.5% agreed with the higher body \nweight of the respective chickens, although the val -\nues were not statistically significant. It seemed that \nprobiotic, prebiotic, and phytogenic activities were \nresponsible for the improved VH/CD in the broiler \nduodenum, as previously documented by Awad et al.  \n[38] and Mohiti-Asli et al. [39]. In the jejunum, the \nCD was quadratically lower (p=0.05) in FERMIX050 \nthan in other groups. According to Chacher et al. \n[40], decreasing the CD could signify efficient tis -\nsue turnover and good gut health. Indeed, the balance \nbetween pathogenic and beneficial bacteria increases \nthe length of the villi and decreases the depth of the \ncrypt [40]. Hence, it could be assumed that the probi -\notic, prebiotic, and phytobiotic activities of FERMIX, \nespecially at 0.5% of diets, could balance the patho -\ngenic and beneficial bacteria, resulting in better gut \nhealth.\nConclusion\nAlthough it did not influence growth, dietary \nFERMIX, notably at 0.5%, improved broiler immune \ncompetencies, as seen by higher spleen relative weight. \nThe physiological conditions were also improved by \nFERMIX at 0.5% of diets, as seen by higher levels \nof erythrocytes, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, \nand plasma total protein. The dietary treatment also \nimproved the health of the intestine by lowering the \ncounts of lactose-negative Enterobacteriaceae , rais -\ning the duodenal VH/CD, and decreasing the depth of \nthe jejunal crypt.\nAuthors\u2019 Contributions\nSS: Outlined the experiment, analyzed data, and \ndrafted the manuscript.
