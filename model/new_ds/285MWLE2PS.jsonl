It has been hypoth\u2011\nesized that L \u2011carnitine can improve cardiovascular risk factors. We aimed to investigate the effect of L \u2011carnitine sup \u2011\nplementation on lipid accumulation product (LAP) and atherogenic indices in women with overweight/obesity who \nhave knee osteoarthritis.\nMethods: In this double \u2011blind randomized controlled trial, seventy\u2011six women with overweight/obesity who had \nknee osteoarthritis were assigned into the intervention group and control group for 12 weeks. The intervention group \nreceived 1000 mg/day L \u2011carnitine as capsule, and the control group received placebo. The primary outcomes were \nLAP , atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), atherogenic coefficient (AC) and Castelli risk index II (CRI\u2011II).\nResults: We found no significant difference between the groups in baseline values of LAP , AIP , AC and CRI\u2011II. After \nthe intervention, a significant reduction in LAP was observed in intervention group compared to the control group \n(\u2212 11.05 (\u2212 28.24 to 0.40) vs. \u2212 5.82 (\u2212 24.44 to 2.68); P = 0.03). However, there was no significant difference between \ntwo groups in AIP (\u2212 0.05 \u00b1 0.16 vs. \u2212 0.01 \u00b1 0.13; P = 0.19), AC (\u2212 0.40 \u00b1 0.81 vs. \u2212 0.30 \u00b1 0.67; P = 0.67) and CRI\u2011II \n(\u2212 0.20 \u00b1 0.76 vs. \u2212 0.21 \u00b1 0.47; P = 0.11).\nConclusions: L\u2011carnitine supplementation for 12 weeks can improve LAP , but it has no effect on cardiovascular out \u2011\ncomes. To reach a definitive conclusion, further clinical trials with larger sample sizes and higher dosages of L \u2011carnitine \nare needed.\nTrial registration: Registered on 27/4/2017 at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT2017011932026N2.\nKeywords: Knee osteoarthritis, L \u2011carnitine, Lipid accumulation product, Cardiovascular risk\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Patients with \nosteoarthritis are suffering from pain, stiffness, deform -\nity, and loss of functional capacity [1, 3, 4]. Knee osteoar -\nthritis is a chronic musculoskeletal disease [3, 5].

BMC Rheumatology            (2022) 6:53 \ngender (female), advanced age and genetic contributed \nto the development of knee osteoarthritis [2\u20135]. Oxida -\ntive stress, obesity and dyslipidemia are involved in the \npathogenesis of osteoarthritis [6\u20138]. On the other hand, \nthe prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk fac -\ntors such as dyslipidemia, obesity and hypertension is \nhigher in individuals with osteoarthritis compared to the \nsubjects without osteoarthritis [9]. Atherogenic indices \nsuch as atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), atherogenic \ncoefficient (AC) and Castelli risk index II (CRI-II) are \nused to estimate the cardiovascular [10, 11]. The equa -\ntions of these indices are based on lipid profile [11]. It \nhas been suggested that atherogenic indices can predict \ncardiovascular risk better than low density lipoprotein-\ncholesterol (LDL-c), triglyceride (TG) or total cholesterol \n(TC) alone [10, 11]. In addition, lipid accumulation prod -\nuct (LAP) as a novel and available index can predict vis -\nceral obesity and cardiometabolic risk [12\u201315]. The LAP \nis based on TG and waist circumference (WC) [13].\nL-carnitine (4-N-trimethylammonium-3-hydroxybu -\ntyric acid) is synthesized from amino acids lysine and \nmethionine [16]. L-carnitine regulates the metabolism of \nfatty acids as well as ATP synthesis [16\u201318]. The dietary \nsources of L-carnitine are meat, fishes and dairy products \n[16, 17]. Some studies investigated the effect of L-car -\nnitine in obesity, insulin resistance and oxidative stress \n[19\u201323]. The recent evidence suggested the beneficial \neffects of L-carnitine on risk factors of knee osteoarthri -\ntis such as obesity and dyslipidemia [20, 21, 23\u201325]. The \nstudies that evaluated the effect of L-carnitine in patients \nwith osteoarthritis are scarce [19, 26, 27]. In addition, \nonly one study examined the effect of L-carnitine sup -\nplementation on LAP and atherogenic indices in women \nwith polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [28]. Therefore, \nwe designed a clinical trial to investigate the effect of \nL-carnitine supplementation on LAP and cardiovascu -\nlar indices in women with overweight/obesity who have \nknee osteoarthritis.\nMethods\nRecruitment and\u00a0eligibility screening\nA total of one hundred women with knee osteoarthritis \nwere screened at the Khatam Al-Anbia clinic of Rheu -\nmatology Department affiliated with Shahid Sadoughi \nUniversity of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran. The inclusion \ncriteria were as follows: subjects with knee osteoarthri -\ntis based on clinical criteria, aged more than 45\u00a0 years, \nand body mass index (BMI) between 25\u201335\u00a0 kg/m2. The \nexclusion criteria were as follows: former or planned \nknee-joint replacement, other rheumatic diseases, severe \nliver or kidney diseases, thyroid diseases, severe heart \ndiseases, pregnancy, taking pharmacological treatments \nfor obesity, lipid lowering medications and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), taking multivitamin, \nminerals, or other nutritional supplements. Unwilling -\nness to continue the trial, and poor compliance (consum -\ning L-carnitine and placebo less than 80% of the expected \namount) were considered as drop-out criteria.\nTrial design\nWe conducted a 12-week double-blind randomized con -\ntrolled trial (RCT) from September 2018 to December \n2018. The study protocol was confirmed by the ethical \ncommittee of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical \nSciences and Health Services in Yazd, Iran (IR.SSU.SPH.\nREC.1395.45). In addition, the protocol was regis -\ntered at the Iranian clinical trials website on 27/4/2017 \n(IRCT2017011932026N2) with URL: https:// www. irct. \nir/ trial/ 25050. A trained person assigned the subjects \ninto the intervention and control groups through sim -\nple randomization using random number table (random \nallocation software) [29]. Allocation concealment was \nconducted using opaque sealed envelopes to prevent \nselection bias by concealing the allocation sequence from \nthose assigning participants to the intervention groups. \nSubjects and investigators were blinded to the interven -\ntion assignment.\nIntervention\nThe intervention group received 1000\u00a0 mg/d L-carni -\ntine as capsule and the control group received the same \namount of placebo (cellulose). Every 2\u00a0 weeks, the sub -\njects received capsules. To estimate the compliance rate, \nthe empty sachets of capsules were collected at the end \nof each month. The capsules of L-carnitine and placebo \nhad similar appearance. All capsules were produced by \nKaren Pharmaceuticals Co., Yazd, Iran. In addition, all \nsubjects followed a low-calorie diet. A registered dietitian \nestimated the energy expenditure of each patient through \nHarris-Benedict formula [30]. The composition of the \ndiet was as follows: 50% to 60% carbohydrates, 15% to \n20% proteins, and less than 30% total fat.\nDietary intake and\u00a0physical activity assessments\nEnergy and macronutrients intakes were assessed by a \n3-day (1 weekend day and 2 nonconsecutive weekdays) \n24-h recall questionnaire at the baseline and week 12. \nAnalysis of the dietary intakes was performed using a \nNutritionist IV software (Warrington, United Kingdom).\nIn addition, physical activity was assessed at the base -\nline and after intervention using a long form of Interna -\ntional Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [31].\nLaboratory and\u00a0anthropometric evaluations\nLaboratory and anthropometric assessments were per -\nformed at the baseline and after intervention. To measure \nPage 3 of 7\n Sangouni\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Rheumatology            (2022) 6:53 \n \nthe serum concentrations of TC, TG and high density \nlipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), 5\u00a0 ml blood was col -\nlected after 8\u00a0 h fasting. The samples were centrifuged \nand immediately frozen and stored at \u2212 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Using an \nautoanalyzer (AVIDA 1800 chemistry system; Siemens, \nUnited Kingdom) and Pars Azmoon kits, the serum con -\ncentrations of TC, TG and HDL-c were measured. In \naddition, estimating LDL-c was performed by the Friede -\nwald\u2019s equation [32].\nAnthropometric measurements were performed at the \nbaseline and after intervention. The weight was measured \nusing a portable digital scale (Omeron BF511, Japan) \nwith an accuracy of 100\u00a0 g. Assessment of height was \nperformed utilizing a stadiometer with an accuracy of \n0.1\u00a0cm. Measuring WC was performed under the stand -\nard protocol by a measuring tape. We calculated body \nmass index (BMI) using the following formula: weight \n(kg)/height squared  (m2).\nIndices\nCalculating LAP [13], AIP [10], AC [33] and CRI-II [34] \nwas performed at baseline and after intervention using \nthe following equations:\nLAPwomen  = (WC\u00a0\u2212\u00a058) \u00d7 TG [ 13].\nAIP = log (TG/HDL-c) [10].\nAC = (TC-HDL-c)/HDL-c [33].\nCRI-II = LDL-c/HDL-c [34].\nSample size and\u00a0statistical analysis\nOur previous article reported the results of clinical symp -\ntoms, lipid profile, C-reactive protein and malondialde -\nhyde [26], and the optimal sample size was estimated to \nbe 38 for each group, by assuming confidence interval, \n\u03b1 = 0.05, and power = 80%. In addition, power analysis \nwas performed and power = 80% was obtained for AC. \nTo analyze the data, a statistical package for social sci -\nence (SPSS) software (Chicago, Illinois, USA) version 24 \nwas used. An intention-to-treat (ITT) approach using \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis method \nwas carried out. In this method, a missing follow-up visit \nvalue is replaced by the last observed value. ITT analysis \nincludes every subject who is randomized according to \nrandomized treatment assignment. It ignores noncom -\npliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and anything \nthat happens after randomization. Assessment of normal \ndistributions was performed by Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov \ntest. We used an independent t-test (for parametric vari -\nables), and Mann\u2013Whitney U test (for non-parametric \nvariables) to compare the variables between groups. In \naddition, analyzing parametric and non-parametric data \nwithin each group was performed using paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test, respectively. To identify the \ndifferences between groups after adjusting for covariates, \nunivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was carried \nout. P \u2264 0.05 was significant.\nResults\nCharacteristics and\u00a0anthropometric variables\nSix participants were excluded from the trial due to lost \nto follow-up. Finally, a total of 70 participants completed \nthe trial (Fig.\u00a0 1). The percentage of adherence to the study \nprotocol was 92.1% (89.4% in intervention group and \n94.7% in placebo group). We found no significant dif -\nference between groups in baseline parameters includ -\ning age, education, occupational status, physical activity, \nenergy intake, macronutrients intake, anthropomet -\nric variables and lipid profile (P > 0.05) (Table\u00a0 1). After \nintervention, there was no difference between groups in \nweight, BMI, WC and energy intake (P > 0.05) (Table\u00a0 2). \nIn addition, no serious adverse effect was reported dur -\ning the trial.\nOutcomes\nThere was no significant difference between groups in \nterms of LAP (P = 0.28), AIP (P = 0.93), AC (P = 0.11) \nand CRI-II (P = 0.15) at the baseline (Table\u00a0 3).

However, L-carnitine supple -\nmentation had no impact on AIP , AC and CRI-II.\nThe LAP index is known as an available and accurate \nscoring system to estimate cardiometabolic risk and \nvisceral obesity [12\u201315]. A RCT evaluated the effect of \n12-week L-carnitine supplementation (1000\u00a0 mg/day) \non LAP , and reported that L-carnitine has no effect on \nLAP among women with PCOS [28]. The crude results of our study was similar to the study of Sangouni et\u00a0 al. \n[28]; however, we found a significant reduction of LAP \nafter adjusting for education of participants. WC and \nTG are used in the equation of LAP [13]. The study of \nMalaguarnera et\u00a0 al. [22] demonstrated that 2000\u00a0 mg/\nday L-carnitine supplementation can improve the lev -\nels of TG in patients with T2DM. In addition, Lee et\u00a0al. \n[35] found a slight reduction in TG after 12-week L-car -\nnitine supplementation in patients coronary artery dis -\nease. However, the study of Malek Mahdavi et\u00a0 al. [19] \nreported that 750\u00a0mg/day L-carnitine has no effect on TG \nin women with osteoarthritis. In addition, Samimi et\u00a0al. \n[23] conducted a study among women with PCOS, and \nshowed that 250\u00a0 mg/day L-carnitine supplementation \nfor 12\u00a0weeks has no effect on TG. It seems, higher dos -\nages of L-carnitine can improve the levels of TG. On the \nother hand, a RCT found a significant reduction of WC \nin patients with PCOS who received L-carnitine sup -\nplementation for 12\u00a0 weeks [36]. However, the RCT of \nSamimi et\u00a0al. [23] reported that L-carnitine supplementa -\ntion (250\u00a0mg/day) for 12\u00a0weeks has no effect on WC in \nwomen with PCOS.

BMC Rheumatology            (2022) 6:53 \n \nsupplementation has a beneficial effect on body composi -\ntion. A meta-analysis of RCTs revealed that L-carnitine \nsupplementation between 1800 and 4000\u00a0 mg/day can \nimprove some anthropometric variables [37]. However, \nfurther RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed to \ndetermine the long-term effects of L-carnitine supple -\nmentation and subsequently reach a reliable conclusion. \nIt has been suggested that L-carnitine can reduce lipid \naccumulation through inducing lipid beta-oxidation, \nregulating hormone-sensitive lipase, acyl-coenzyme A \noxidase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\ngamma (the main factors involved in the lipid catabolism \nor adipogenesis), regulating appetite control, decreasing \nenergy intake and increasing energy expenditure [20, 21].\nWe demonstrated that AIP , AC and CRI-II did not \nchange after 12-week L-carnitine supplementation. Con -\nsistent with our findings, a RCT showed that L-carnitine \nsupplementation (1000\u00a0 mg/day) for 12\u00a0 weeks could not \nimprove AIP , AC and CRI-II in patients with PCOS [28]. \nAIP , AC and CRI-II are based on lipid profile [10, 33, 34]. \nThe study of Baghban et\u00a0al. [26] demonstrated that L-car -\nnitine supplementation (1000\u00a0mg/day) has no significant effect on TG, TC, LDL-c and HDL-c in women with \nknee osteoarthritis. In addition, the RCT of Samimi et\u00a0al. \n[23] reported that 250\u00a0mg/day L-carnitine supplementa -\ntion for 12\u00a0weeks could not improve TG, TC, LDL-c and \nHDL-c in women with PCOS. Moreover, a RCT found \nthat L-carnitine supplementation for 12\u00a0weeks with dose \nof 1000\u00a0mg/day has no impact on lipid profile in patients \nwith PCOS [38]. However, the study of Malaguarnera \net\u00a0 al. [22] demonstrated a significant reduction of TG, \nLDL-c and oxidized LDL-c in patients with T2DM who \nreceived 2000\u00a0 mg/day L-carnitine supplementation \nfor 12\u00a0 weeks. According to evidence, the main reason \nof some inconsistencies in this field can be the differ -\nence in dosage of L-carnitine. It seems, high dosage of \nL-carnitine has some beneficial effect on lipid profile. A \nmeta-analysis reported that L-carnitine intake more than \n2000\u00a0 mg/day can improve the blood lipid parameters \n[39]. High dose of L-carnitine can stimulate apolipopro -\ntein-A1 production, decrease synthesis of TG and esteri -\nfication toward acetylcarnitines formation, increase lipid \nbeta-oxidation, regulate hormone-sensitive lipase and \ninduce lipid catabolism [25, 40, 41].Table 3 Effect of L \u2011carnitine on indices in women with knee osteoarthritis*\nValues for AIP , AC and Castelli risk index II are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), while for LAP are presented as median and quartile range\n*P values are computed by Mann\u2013Whitney U test\n**P values are computed by Wilcoxon test\nP: resulted from within each group comparison\nP\u2020: resulted from comparing the means of each variable at the end of the study, between groups\nP\u2020\u2020: adjusted based on education and baseline values of parameters using univariate ANCOVA\nLAP: lipid accumulation product; AIP: atherogenic index of plasma; AC: atherogenic coefficient; CRI-II: Castelli risk index IIIndices L-carnitine (n = 38) Placebo (n = 38) P\u2020P\u2020\u2020\nLAP\nBaseline 88.76 (69.02 to 105.40) 100.57 (70.05 to 138.81) 0.28* 0.03\nWeek 12 74.70 (44.24 to 104.92) 101.69 (61.25 to 113.22) 0.05*\nP 0.002** 0.05**\nMean change of LAP \u2212 11.05 (\u2212 28.24 to 0.40) \u2212 5.82 (\u2212 24.44 to 2.68) 0.28*\nAIP\nBaseline 0.09 \u00b1 0.19 0.09 \u00b1 0.19 0.93 0.19\nWeek 12 0.04 \u00b1 0.17 0.08 \u00b1 0.20 0.37\nP 0.04 0.57\nMean change of AIP \u2212 0.05 \u00b1 0.16 \u2212 0.01 \u00b1 0.13 0.21\nAC\nBaseline 2.83 \u00b1 0.79 2.53 \u00b1 0.83 0.11 0.67\nWeek 12 2.43 \u00b1 0.60 2.23 \u00b1 0.81 0.22\nP 0.004 0.008\nMean change of AC \u2212 0.40 \u00b1 0.81 \u2212 0.30 \u00b1 0.67 0.57\nCRI-II\nBaseline 2.32 \u00b1 0.77 2.07 \u00b1 0.73 0.15 0.11\nWeek 12 2.12 \u00b1 0.47 1.85 \u00b1 0.57 0.03\nP 0.11 0.01\nMean change of CRI\u2011II \u2212 0.20 \u00b1 0.76 \u2212 0.21 \u00b1 0.47 0.94\nPage 6 of 7 Sangouni\u00a0et\u00a0al. BMC Rheumatology            (2022) 6:53 \nWe declare that our research group reported the find -\nings of clinical symptoms, anthropometric parameters, \nlipid profile, C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde \n[26], and we used the same data for the present article. To \nfollow the principals of ethics in research, we clarify that \nFig.\u00a0 1 and some important information of the mentioned \narticle [26] were added to the present article.\nAs an important strength, the present study was the \nfirst RCT that investigated the effect of L-carnitine sup -\nplementation on indices such as LAP , AIP , AC and CRI-II \nin women with knee osteoarthritis. However, the present \nstudy had some important limitations. The dosage of \nL-carnitine that we used for this study was low. In addi -\ntion, the sample size of this study was small. A small sam -\nple size may make it difficult to reach a firm conclusion.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, L-carnitine supplementation (1000\u00a0 mg/\nday) for 12\u00a0weeks improved LAP , but it has no effect on \natherogenic indices. Studies with larger sample sizes \nas well as higher dosages of L-carnitine are required to \ndemonstrate the real efficacy of L-carnitine.\nAbbreviations\nANCOVA: Analysis of covariance; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; HDL \u2011c: High \ndensity lipoprotein\u2011 cholesterol; IPAQ: International physical activity question\u2011\nnaire; ITT: Intention\u2011to \u2011treat; LAP: Lipid accumulation product; LDL \u2011c: Low \ndensity lipoprotein\u2011 cholesterol; LOCF: Last observation carried forward; \nNAFLD: Non\u2011alcoholic fatty liver disease; PCOS: Polycystic ovary syndrome; \nRCT : Randomized controlled trial; SPSS: Statistical package for social science; \nT2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus; TC: Total cholesterol; TG: Triglyceride; VAI: \nVisceral adiposity index; WC: Waist circumference.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge the contribution of the patients and co \u2011researchers.\nAuthor contributions\nMH, HM \u2011Kh and FBconducted the study, ADprovided material and technical \nsupport, AS carried out the statistical analysis, AS and MKh interpreted the \nfindings and drafted the manuscript, MH critically revised the manuscript, and \nMH supervised the study.
