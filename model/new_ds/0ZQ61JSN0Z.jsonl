Introduction\nPneumonia in children is caused by viral or bacterial patho-\ngens. Worldwide, pneumonia is the leading cause of pediat-\nric morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that more than \n2 million children under 5 years of age die from pneumonia \neach year, accounting for 20% of the annual deaths in this \nage group.[1\u20133] Treatment of pneumonia includes antimicrobial \ndrugs, supportive management with supplemental oxygen, \nintravenous fluids, and antipyretics. Immunization, breast-\nfeeding, adequate nutrition and good hygiene can help pre-\nvent pneumonia.[4]\nVitamin A plays an important pleiotropic role in supporting a \nnormal mucosal barrier. Vitamin A deficiency has been found to \nincrease the risk of invasive pathogens by causing squamous respi-\nratory epithelial metaplasia, impaired airway mucosal barrier, \ndelayed repair, and decreased airway antioxidants.[5\u20137] Children \nwith vitamin A deficiency are more likely to develop acute respi-\nratory infections and diarrhea. Zinc is essential for gene expres-\nsion and plays an important role in nucleic acid and protein \nsynthesis, cell replication, tissue growth and repair.[8,9] Therefore, \nzinc plays an important role in the development and maintenance \nof host defense against infection. The therapeutic benefit of oral \nzinc in diarrhea has been well documented in a review of 18 trials by Cochrane, which showed that oral zinc shortened the recovery \ntime of children with acute or persistent diarrhea in the 6 months \nto 5 years age group. It has also been shown that routine zinc sup-\nplementation reduces the risk of acute respiratory tract infections \nand clinical pneumonia in children.[10]\nThere is still controversy regarding the role of zinc and vita-\nmin A supplementation in pediatric pneumonia. More specifi-\ncally, the literature remains unclear regarding the advantages and \ndisadvantages of zinc supplementation alone, vitamin A supple-\nmentation alone, and combined zinc and vitamin A supplemen-\ntation. No comprehensive review has attempted to address this \nissue; therefore, we designed a systematic review and network \nmeta-analysis to incorporate the available evidence to determine \nthe role of vitamin A and zinc in pediatric pneumonia.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Search strategy\nFrom the inception to December 31, 2022, the Web of \nScience, EMBASE, Medicine, the Cochrane Central Register of \nControlled Trials and Cochrane Library electronic databases \nwere searched using the key phrases \u201cpneumonia,\u201d \u201cpediat-\nric,\u201d \u201czinc,\u201d \u201cvitamin A,\u201d and \u201ccohort\u201d for all relevant studies. \nJiangsu science and technology bureau project (N2021265).\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\nData sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or \nanalyzed during the current study.\nCRD42022371391.\na Respiratory department, Children\u2019s Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical \nUniversity, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.\n* Correspondence: Qing Han, Respiratory department, Children\u2019s Hospital \nAffiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China (e-mail: \nrjunpq00132@163.com).Copyright \u00a9 2022 the Author(s).

Study registration and ethical consideration\nThe protocol was registered on PROSPERO, with the regis-\ntration number CRD42022371391. We will update our pro-\ntocol for any changes in the entire research process if needed. \nGiven that the study data are based on a database study, ethical \napproval does not seem to apply to this paper.\n2.3. Eligibility criteria\nThis Bayesian network meta-analysis will be conducted in accor -\ndance with the PRISMA extension statement, which is used to \nreport systematic reviews that incorporated a meta-analysis of \nmedical intervention networks. Cohort studies assessing the effi-\ncacy and safety of zinc and/or vitamin A supplementation in \nchildren with pneumonia will be included for quantitative or \nqualitative analysis. Non-cohort studies and studies that do not \nmeet the inclusion criteria will be excluded. In addition, there \nare no language and publication time restrictions for this study. \nThe following PICO protocol is drafted to guide the search:\nP (population): Pediatric patients with pneumonia\nI (intervention): Group with vitamin A plus zinc\nC (comparison): Group with vitamin A or group with zinc or \nplacebo\nO (outcomes): Outcome measures include reduction in duration \nof pneumonia, adverse drug events, length of hospital stay, amount \nof antibiotics used, and radiological parameters. The primary out-\ncome is the degree of reduction in the duration of pneumonia.\n2.4. Selection of studies and data extraction\nEach trial will be independently assessed by 2 reviewers for \nscreening and data extraction. In case of disagreement, consen-\nsus is reached through discussion among reviewers or consulta-\ntion with senior scholars. We will screen for trial eligibility, extract \ndata, and reach consensus using a standardized and piloted web-\nbased data management tool and a codebook. We will extract trial \nfeatures such as design, size, and duration; characteristics of the \nintervention, such as dose and duration of treatment; participant \ncharacteristics such as mean age, sex, Body Mass Index, and mean \nduration of symptoms; as well as the outcome data for each time \npoint of interest. Where necessary, we approximate summary sta-\ntistics and variability measures from the charts. Where possible, \noutcomes based on intention-to-treat principles are extracted.\n2.5. Statistical analysis\nThe network meta-analyses will be performed using STATA/\nMP 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), through the routine \nfor Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model. The network \nmeta-analysis combines data from several different randomized \ncomparisons across treatments to provide a set of internally \nconsistent estimates, taking into account randomization within \neach trial. The network meta-analysis will be performed within \nthe framework of a generalized linear model, where the link \nfunction specifies the relationship between the outcome and the \nmodel coefficients to be estimated. When the endings are con-\ntinuous, the likelihood is modeled as normal. When the endings \nare event rates, the likelihood is modeled as Poisson. A random \neffects model is used for this analysis. Estimation is performed in \na Bayesian context using the non-information prior distribution \nof the parameters. The model is evaluated using the Deviation \nInformation Criterion, a measure that combines model fit and \ncomplexity. The analysis is estimated using a Bayesian Markov \nChain Monte Carlo model.2.6. Risk of bias and quality assessments\nTwo investigators will separately assess the methodological \nquality of the included studies. A modified Oxford score (rang-\ning from 0\u20137) is used to measure the methodological quality of \nall studies as described in the randomization, masked assign-\nment, blinding, and participant withdrawal reports.[11] Any con-\ntroversy will be resolved by discussing with a third author to \nreach a final consensus.\n2.7. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis\nStudy quality will be assessed using a modified Cochrane risk of \nbias assessment tool. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the \n2 items with the highest risk of bias and on the included stud-\nies. Subgroup analyses are performed to assess differences in the \nefficacy of different doses of zinc and vitamin A in patients.\n3. Discussion\nZinc deficiency can lead to growth disorders, loss of appetite, \nbehavioral changes and impaired immune function, resulting in \nsusceptibility to infections. Regarding vitamin A, it is 1 of the \nmost important micronutrients and is essential for many vital \nfunctions such as cell growth, epithelial integrity and immune \nsystem response. There is still controversy regarding the role \nof zinc and vitamin A supplementation in pediatric pneumo-\nnia. More specifically, the literature remains unclear regarding \nthe advantages and disadvantages of zinc supplementation \nalone, vitamin A supplementation alone, and combined zinc \nand vitamin A supplementation. No comprehensive review has \nattempted to address this issue; therefore, we designed a sys-\ntematic review and network meta-analysis to incorporate the \navailable evidence to determine the role of vitamin A and zinc in \npediatric pneumonia. We hypothesized that combined zinc and \nvitamin A supplementation would minimize the rate of healing \nand mortality of pediatric pneumonia.\nAuthor contributions\nConceptualization: Qing Han.\nData curation: Yu Shi, Qihong Lei.\nFormal analysis: Yu Shi, Qihong Lei.\nFunding acquisition: Qing Han.\nInvestigation: Yu Shi, Qihong Lei.\nMethodology: Qing Han.\nResources: Qing Han.\nSupervision: Hongxia Liu.\nWriting \u2013 original draft: Yu Shi.\nWriting \u2013 review & editing: Hongxia Liu.\nReferences\n [1] Yun KW, Wallihan R, Juergensen A, et al.
