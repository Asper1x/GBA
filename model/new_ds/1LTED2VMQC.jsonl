Caregivers of children are essential in the control of VAD; \nhowever, there is a paucity of data on their knowledge of VA, dietary sources, and VAD. This study sought to assess the \nlevel of VA-related nutrition knowledge (VANK) and its predictors among caregivers of preschool children in Eastern \nUganda.\nMethods  A cross-sectional analytical design was used. Both socio-demographic and knowledge and attitude (KA) \ndata were collected using a structured questionnaire partly adapted from the FAO model Knowledge, Attitude and \nPractice (KAP) questionnaire. A sample size of 256 was used. Caregivers of 24\u201359 months-old children were selected \nfrom Bukwo District in Eastern Uganda using purposive and random sampling methods. Knowledge scores (%) based \non responses to ten questions were determined and eventually classified as low (\u2264 40%) and moderate or high ( \u02c340%). \nDescriptive and inferential statistics were computed using SPSS (version 24). Logistic regression was used to identify \npredictors with p < 0.05 considered significant.\nResults  The study had 247 caregivers with a mean age of 30.9 \u00b1 7.7 years. The majority were female (90%), married, \nsubsistence crop farmers and had primary-level education or lower. The mean VANK score was 18.9 \u00b1 24.7%. Overall, \nmost of the caregivers had low VANK as only about 20% had moderate or high. The proportions that knew the \ndifferent aspects of VANK were correspondingly small. About half of the caregivers (46.6%) knew VA itself and only \n27% knew any of its sources. Those who knew VAD, its causes, signs/symptoms and prevention measures were 31, 22, \n13 and 24% respectively. The caregivers\u2019 VANK was significantly associated with their overall VA-related attitude, age \nand level of education. However, education and age were the significant predictors.\nConclusion  Caregivers had very low VANK. They barely knew VA and its food sources or VAD. The main predictors \nof VANK were caregiver age and level of education. The study recommends education of caregivers about VA for \neffective VAD control which contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2.Vitamin A-related nutrition knowledge gaps \nand predictors among caregivers of preschool \nchildren in Eastern Uganda: a cross-sectional \nstudy\nGilbert\u00a0Mangusho1*, Eunice\u00a0Njogu2, Rhona Kezabu\u00a0Baingana3 and Dorcus Mbithe\u00a0David-Kigaru2\nPage 2 of 10\nMangusho et al. BMC Nutrition            (2024) 10:85 \nBackground\nVitamin A Deficiency (VAD) is linked to poverty, espe -\ncially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [ 1, 2] and is persis -\ntent in Uganda and other low-income countries (LICs) \nin Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean [ 3, 4]. In \nthese countries, sub-clinical VAD affects 6\u201335% of pre -\nschool children [ 5, 6]. Worldwide, it is estimated that \nover 200\u00a0 million preschool-age children have VAD [ 7] \nand it remains a public health problem, particularly in \nSSA [ 8]. The primary effects of VAD are the functional \nimpairment of sight and debilitation of various physi -\nological processes including the immune response and \nwide-ranging secondary effects on health, productivity \nand growth of populations [ 1, 6].\nDespite nearly three decades-long VAD control efforts \nin Uganda including vitamin A supplementation (VAS), \nfood fortification, and bio-fortification [ 9\u201311], VAD \nremains a significant problem. The leading cause of VAD \nin preschool-age children is poor dietary vitamin A (VA) \nintake [ 12]. This factor could be addressed if caregivers \n(persons primarily charged with daily preschool-child \ncare/feeding) had the requisite knowledge, skills and \nmaterial resources. Caregivers\u2019 VA-related nutrition \nknowledge (VANK), including knowledge of VA as a \nnutrient important for the sight function and of VAD as \na physiological disorder resulting from insufficient bodily \nVA, facilitates the development of useful attitudes and \npractices that aid in alleviating the VAD burden [ 1, 13].\nStudy design and setting\nThis was a cross-sectional analytical study involving \ncaregivers of preschool children aged 24\u201359 months. It \nwas carried out in Bukwo District in Eastern Uganda, \na region with a total population of 9,042,422 [ 14], one \nof the poorest [ 15] in addition to having higher rates \nof VAD than most of the other regions in Uganda. The \nmain economic activity is subsistence agriculture, similar \nto other rural areas in the country [ 16]. Bukwo Districts \nis located on the eastern slopes of Mt Elgon, with the \nadministrative centre about 130 and 350\u00a0km northeast of \nMbale and Kampala respectively. It borders the districts \nKween (to the west and northwest) and Amudat (north), \nand the Republic of Kenya to the east and south. The dis -\ntrict, unlike most other parts of the country has one main \ncrop-growing season in a year where, typical of Uganda, \na variety of crops mainly maize and beans are grown. At \nthe time of the study, the district was minimally acces -\nsible due to poor roads and mountainous terrain. The \nnearest all-weather road was about 70\u00a0km away.Sample selection\nThe sample size (n) was first calculated from the Yamane \nformula n = N/(1 + N(e)2) [17], where N was the estimated \npopulation of preschool-age children in Eastern Uganda \n(1.3\u00a0 million [ 14]) and e 5%. The result (400) was then \nmodified for cluster sampling according to Hemming et \nal. [18] and Killip et al. [ 19]. An intra-class correlation \ncoefficient (\u03c1) of 0.03 was assumed and the required clus -\nter number (n\u03c1 or 12) was raised to 32 (by 20) for higher \npower and reasonable cost. Therefore, the maximum \ncluster size would be 20 (n/20) and corresponding sample \nsize 640. However, preliminary qualitative data showed \nthat a typical cluster in the area had only 6\u201310 eligible \ncaregivers. Considering the available resources, a cluster \nsize of eight, and 32 clusters were finally chosen, hence a \ntotal sample size of 256.\nA Multi-stage procedure (Fig.\u00a0 1) was used to select \nthe caregivers. Both Eastern Uganda and Bukwo District \nwere purposively selected, the former for its relative share \nof VAD, and the latter for being largely rural, remote from \nlarge food markets and lacking evidence of on-going VA-\nrelated interventions. To select caregivers, the district \n(12 sub-counties) was geographically stratified into four \nequal blocks from each of which one sub-county was \nselected using Simple Random Sampling (SRS)/lottery. A \nlist of clusters/villages with estimated sizes was obtained \nfrom the respective sub-county leaders. Small clusters \n(< 25 households) were excluded because they were more \nunlikely to provide the required numbers of caregivers. \nEight clusters and, subsequently, eight households/care -\ngivers with children 24\u201359 months were selected by SRS \n(lottery). The main individual that was responsible for \nmaking the daily child-feeding decisions in a household \nwas chosen as the caregiver. Those who had spent less \nthan a month with the child, had mental illnesses, or did \nnot consent to the study were excluded.\nData collection\nData were collected using a structured questionnaire. \nThe data consisted of VA knowledge (including VA itself, \nfood sources, and VAD, its causes, signs/symptoms and \nprevention), VA-related attitude and socio-demograph -\nics (gender, age, education, marital status, household \nsize, occupation, economic activity, income, caregiver-\nchild-household head relationships, type of health-care \nprovider). The questionnaire (see Supplementary File \n1) was partly adapted from FAO\u2019s Knowledge, Attitude, \nand Practices (KAP) model questionnaire and guidelines \n[16]. The model questionnaire was chosen because of its \nuniqueness in having a module specific for VA which was Keywords  Vitamin A, Caregivers, Knowledge, Vitamin A deficiency, Sources, Signs/symptoms, Prevention, Preschool \nchildren\nPage 3 of 10\nMangusho et al. BMC Nutrition            (2024) 10:85 \nappropriate for this study. The final version contained 10 \nmostly open-ended knowledge questions, eight attitude \nitems based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) captured \nusing a five-point Likert scale as shown in Table\u00a0 1, and \na number of socio-demographic questions adapted from \nUSAID\u2019s Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) pro -\ngram model questionnaires.\nThe enumerators were recruited and trained before the \nstudy. The questionnaire was translated into the local lan -\nguage and then back-translated to English during train -\ning, pretested and adjusted accordingly before being used \nfor the actual data collection. Face-face interviews with \ncaregivers were conducted at the household premises \nusing the local language.\nData analysis\nData were manually checked daily during collection to \nensure completeness. Responses to knowledge ques -\ntions were later scored using a marking guide designed \nto control for guesswork. Answers to questions espe -\ncially the multiple-response type such as VA sources, and \ncauses, signs/symptoms and measures to prevent VAD \nwere scrutinized based on their consistency. Each cor -\nrect answer was awarded 2 marks and an incorrect one, \n0 (zero). The data were then entered using an MS Access \n2016 (Version 16.0) database equipped with validation \nrules to limit errors during entry. The entered data were \ninspected, cleaned, and exported to SPSS (Version 24) for \nfurther cleaning and analysis.\nThe scores for all knowledge items were summed up \nto obtain an individual caregiver mark which and con -\nverted into a percentage. The maximum possible score \n(100%) was 20 marks. The mean score (%) was computed \nfor all caregivers. The scores were also categorized into low ( \u2264 40%), moderate (41\u201369%) and high ( \u2265 70) as in \nKigaru et al. [ 20]. The lower cut-off of 40% was consid -\nered appropriate to distinguish no or low from reason -\nable knowledge for ordinary caregivers who had no prior \npreparation for this relatively more specific study (on \nVA) as there were no similar studies or references. For \nattitude, an aggregate score was obtained for each care -\ngiver by calculating the mean score in the eight items. \nThe mean aggregate score was also computed to repre -\nsent the overall caregivers\u2019 attitude. Aggregate scores \u2264 3 \nwere categorized as poor attitude whereas 4 and 5 were \ncategorized as good. Proportions of caregivers with good \nand poor attitude were established. The SPSS (Version \n24) and MS Excel 2016 (Version 16.0) were used to per -\nform statistical tests and data transformations. Descrip -\ntive statistics including frequencies, means (and standard \ndeviations) were computed and used to describe the data. \nBivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression anal -\nyses were performed to identify the predictors of VANK. \nIn the regression, the VANK categories were reduced to \ntwo by creating a dichotomy around the lower cut-off, in \neffect, merging \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201chigh. \u201d Because attitude \ndata were obtained from only a sub-sample, attitude was \nexcluded from the multivariate analysis. The unit of anal -\nysis was the individual caregiver rather than the cluster to \nmaintain the study power.\nEthical approval\nThis study was approved by the Mildmay Uganda \nResearch Ethical Committee, MUREC (REC REF 0306\u2013\n2019) and registered by the Uganda National Council \nfor Science and Technology, UNCST (HS2664). Before \ninclusion, the caregiver provided written consent after an \nexplanation of the study aims and procedures had been Table 1  Likert scale values for measurement of VA-related attitude variables\nAttitude Variable* Value on Likert scale**\n1 2 3 4 5\nSusceptibility to VAD Very unlikely Unlikely Neutral Likely Very likely\nSeverity/seriousness of VAD Not serious at all Not serious Neutral Serious Very serious\nImportance of feeding child with VA foods Not important at all Not Important Neutral Important Very important\nTaste of VA-rich plant foods Dislike greatly Dislike Neutral Like Like greatly\nDifficulty preparing VA foods Very difficult Difficult Neutral Not difficult Not difficult at all\nConfidence preparing VA foods Not confident at all Not confident Neutral Confident Very confident\nCues for feeding VA foods Disagree strongly Disagree Neutral Agree Agree strongly\nBarriers to feeding VA foods Strongly Disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly Agree\n*As perceived by caregiver; **Responses ranked on a scale of 1\u20135\nFig. 1  Sampling procedure \nPage 4 of 10\nMangusho et al.

The filled questionnaires were kept in a \nspecial locked room and coded before entry to remove \nany personally identifiable information to ensure ano -\nnymity and confidentiality.Results\nSocio-demographic characteristics of caregivers\nA total of 247 out of the 256 selected caregivers partici -\npated in the study, representing nearly 97% of the sample \nsize. Only 3% were not found. The overall mean age was \n30.9 \u00b1 7.7 years, and most of them (90%) were female. The \nmajority had, at most, primary school-level education, \nwere married (94.3%), biological parents to the children \n(93%), subsistence crop farmers, and earned low monthly \nhousehold income ($14\u201328) as shown in Table\u00a0 2. The \nmean household size was 6.4 \u00b1 2.2 persons (95% CI: \n6.2\u20136.7).\nOverall vitamin A-related knowledge\nThe caregivers had very low levels of VANK \n(mean = 18.9% \u00b124.7, 95% CI: 15.9\u201321.9). More than \nhalf (132/53.4%) had no VANK whatsoever (VANK = 0). \nAmong those who had some knowledge (VANK > 0), \nthe mean VANK score (40.6 \u00b1 20.7%, 95% CI: 37.0-44.3) \nwas marginally moderate and, therefore, shallow. A clear \nmajority of all the caregivers (79.4%, 95% CI: 74.5\u201384.2) \nhad low VANK. The rest had moderate (15.8%, 95% CI: \n11.3\u201320.6) or high (4.8%, 95% CI: 2.4\u20137.3). Therefore, \nonly about 20% had moderate or high knowledge and the \nrest, low. There was no difference in VANK between the \nclusters, x2(31) = 42.64, p = 0.08.\nKnowledge of vitamin A, sources, and deficiency\nBarely half of the caregivers (46.6%) knew VA itself and \nwere therefore able to provide data on VAD and VA-\nrelated attitude (Fig.\u00a0 2).\nSmall proportions of caregivers had knowledge of the \ndifferent aspects of VA (Table\u00a0 3). Less than a third of all \n(two-thirds of those who knew VA) knew VAD. Among \nthem, the majority correctly identified the causes and \npreventive measures for VAD. There were also wide \ngaps in knowledge of VA-rich foods in the different \ngroups (animal; Dark Green Leafy Vegetables,\u00a0 DGLVs; \nfruits; Vegetables, Tubers and Roots,\u00a0 VTRs,\u00a0 and VA-\nfortified foods) as shown.

The VA-\nfortified foods were much better known than the DGLVs \nand VA-rich fruits.\nAs shown in Table\u00a0 4, the caregivers mentioned various \nfoods within the different groups as sources of VA. The \nleading foods were eggs and dairy (animal), Dodo ( Ama -\nranthus ), passion fruits, Irish potatoes (plant) and cook -\ning oil and wheat flour (industrially processed). However, \nsome of the foods, such as passion fruits and potatoes \nwere not truly good VA sources. The best known true \nVA-rich foods among the fruits and VTRs were actually \nripe mango and orange-fleshed sweet potato respectively, \nboth mentioned with incomparably lower frequencies \nthan the non-VA rich counterparts.\nKnowledge of causes, signs/symptoms, and prevention \nmeasures for VAD\nThe majority of caregivers mentioned consumption of a \npoor variety of food as the cause of VAD (Table\u00a0 5). Other \ncauses cited included a VA-deficient diet, infections, \ninadequate food intake, poor feeding, poor fruit intake, \ninadequate breastfeeding, and insufficient medical care. \nAmong the VAD signs/symptoms mentioned, physical \nweakness (an unspecific symptom) predominated over \neye problems and frequent infections which are the key \nVAD signs/symptoms. Also, the leading VAD control \nmeasure named by caregivers was increased consump -\ntion of VA\u2013rich (including VA-fortified) foods.Table 3  Caregiver knowledge of different aspects of VA and VAD\nAspect of VANK Caregivers with knowledge\nn % (N = 115 or 76)1% (N = 247)2\nVA Sources and VAD N = 115*\nAnimal foods 67 58.3 27.1\nDGLVs 19 16.5 7.7\nFruits 76.1 2.8\nVTRs 32.6 1.2\nVA-fortified foods 36 31.3 14.6\nVAD 76 66.1 30.8\nVAD  signs, causes, prevention N = 76**\nSigns/symptoms of VAD 32 42.2 13.0\nCauses of VAD 54 71.1 21.9\nPrevention of VAD 60 78.9 24.3\nVA = Vitamin A; VAD = Vitamin A Deficiency; 1Caregivers who knew VA or VAD; \n2All caregivers\n*Caregivers who knew VA; **Caregivers who knew VAD; DGLVs = Dark Green \nLeafy Vegetables; VTRs = Vegetables, Tubers and Roots\nTable 4  Knowledge of VA-rich foods\nVA-rich Food* Caregivers\nn %(N = 115a) %(N = 247b)\nAnimal foods\nLiver 39 33.9 15.8\nEggs 62 53.9 25.1\nMilk/Milk products 62 53.9 25.1\nOthers (non-VA-rich)d26 22.5 10.5\nDGLVs\nKale (Brassica spp) 51 44.3 20.6\nAmaranthus leaves/dodo 52 45.2 21.1\nPumpkin leaves 17 14.8 6.9\nLocal green vegetables (various) 43 37.4 17.4\nOthers (non-VA-rich vegetables \ne.g., cabbages)c26 22.6 10.5\nFruits\nRipe mango 18 15.7 7.3\nRipe papaya 5 4.3 2.0\nOthers (non-VA-rich: melons, \noranges, berries, guavas, passion \nfruits, etc.) c120 104.3 48.6\nVTRs\nOrange sweet potato 17 14.8 6.9\nCarrot 11 9.6 4.5\nPumpkin 5 4.3 2.0\nOthers (non-VA-rich potatoes, \nyams, etc.)c93 81 37.7\nVA-fortified\nMargarine 15 13.0 6.1\nCooking oil 23 20.0 9.3\nWheat Flour 23 20.0 9.3\nOthers (not VA-fortified)c84 73.1 34.0\naCaregivers who knew VA; bAll caregivers; cFoods mentioned but incorrect: \nDGLVs  = Dark Green Leafy Vegetables; VTRs = Vegetables, Tubers and Roots; \n*according to caregivers; n\u00a0 =\u00a0number/count; %\u00a0 =\u00a0percentTable 5  Causes, signs/symptoms, and means of prevention of \nVAD by caregivers\nAspect of VAD Caregivers\nn %(N = 76)1%(N = 247)2\nCauses\nPoor food variety 47 61.8 19\nDiet lacking VA 5 6.6 2\nInfections 5 6.6 2\nToo little food 8 10.5 3\nOthers (Poor feeding, fruit \nintake, breastfeeding and medi -\ncal care)8.9 11.7 3.4\nDon\u2019t know 9 11.8 4\nSigns/Symptoms\nPhysical weakness 48 63.2 19.4\nEye problems 10 13.2 4.1\nInfections 22 29 8.9\nDon\u2019t know 16 21 6.5\nPreventive measures\nVA-rich diet 50 65.7 20.2\nVA-supplements 14 18.4 5.7\nNutritious and varied diet 8 10.4 3.2\n1Caregivers who knew VAD; 2All caregivers; n = number/count; % = percent\nPage 6 of 10\nMangusho et al.

Crude and adjusted odds ratios (COR and AOR) were used to \nrepresent the relationships. Caregiver\u2019s age, education \nand VA-related attitude had statistically significant CORs \n(Table\u00a0 6).

Similarly, older caregivers ( \u2265 36 years) \nwere more likely to have moderate or high knowledge \nthan younger ones aged 26\u201330.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to establish the gaps in and \npredictors of VANK among caregivers of preschool chil -\ndren in Eastern Uganda. The level of VANK among care -\ngivers was found to be low (only nearly 20%), with a clear \nmajority (about 80%) having low knowledge. More than \nhalf of the caregivers did not know VA itself; around 75% \nhad no knowledge of any VA-rich food or VAD and its \nsigns/symptoms, causes and control measures. Two fac -\ntors: caregiver\u2019s age and educational level were significant \npredictors of VANK.\nThe study was carried out in Bukwo district which, \ndespite being relatively inaccessible, has largely similar \nsocio-demographic/economic and agro-ecological char -\nacteristics to those of most rural areas of other districts \nin Eastern Uganda [ 14, 21]. The caregivers were mainly \nyouthful married mothers of children 24\u201359 months, \nrepresenting a mature and experienced cohort that is \nactive in child feeding. They were slightly older than \nthose for a similar study in Pakistan (29 years) [ 22], and \nyounger than for another one in Tanzania (40.75 years) \n[23]. The households, like most in Eastern Uganda, were \nlarger than the average nationally (4.6 persons) and in \nrural Uganda (4.8 persons) [ 16]. Compared to national \nstatistics on educational attainment for aggregate \nnational, rural or mountainous regions [ 16] (the study \nsite being in a mountainous area), the caregivers had lev -\nels of education which were similarly distributed, as the \nhighest proportion was those with primary education or \nnone followed by those with some secondary education \nand the lowest, those with upper secondary and beyond.\nThe main instruments adapted for this study have been \nused by others including Weerasekera et al. [ 24]. They are \nbased on other validated tools/models such as the HBM \n[25] and are generally considered valid. In addition, the \nmodule for VA was peculiarly relevant to this study as \nsimilar modules were rare or unavailable.\nThis study found that most caregivers had low VANK. \nA systematic review by Barbosa et al. [ 26] shows that \nknowledge is commonly classified into low, moderate, \nand high although some studies, such as Liu et al. [ 27], \ndo not explicitly do so. Most studies, including Kigaru \net al. [ 20], which used the knowledge classification were, \nhowever, concerned with general nutrition knowledge \nand not specifically on VA as this study was, and involved \ndifferent population groups. Similar studies were rare \nand, therefore, a reference cut-off was not available. The \n40% cut\u2013off used in this study facilitated a more realistic assessment of the specific kind of nutrition knowledge \namong a group with widely varying characteristics.\nThese findings were similar to those in other related \nstudies [ 22, 28] but slightly different from studies in \nTanzania [ 23], Kenya [ 29], Ghana [ 30] and Ethiopia [ 31] \nwhich showed higher knowledge levels. These stud -\nies were different from this study because most of them \ninvolved urban caregivers who are usually more informed \nthan rural dwellers, were conducted after major interven -\ntions, and concerned mainly VAS.\nThe caregivers had generally poor knowledge of most \nof the aspects of VANK, but there were some variations \nwithin different aspects. On VA sources, animal-foods \nwere known better than other food types possibly due \nto a seemingly narrow range of animal foods used by the \ncaregivers which incidentally are also good VA sources. \nSome of these foods including the eggs and dairy, are \ncheaper and therefore more frequently used than others, \nfor example, liver. The fortified foods are equally few and \nusually labelled and promoted on mass media channels \nhence increasing caregivers\u2019 knowledge which, however, \nwas still very low. Hardly 10% of all caregivers knew any \nVA-rich fruit, vegetable or root/tuber, showing that they \nlacked basic knowledge of the nature of VA-rich plant \nfoods in which the orange colour as seen in ripe man -\ngoes, pumpkins and carrots, is a key indicator [ 32]. The \nDGLVs like kale and Amaranthus, though excellent pro-\nVA sources [ 28, 33], were not clearly known. Despite \nbeing mentioned, they were often undistinguished from \ncabbages, beans and other non-VA-rich vegetables \nthereby portraying a lack of true knowledge. Similarly, \nVA-rich fruits, roots and tubers were less known. In addi -\ntion, it appeared that majority of caregivers incorrectly \nbelieved that any fruit was a good source of VA.\nThere was little knowledge of VAD among caregivers. \nThis knowledge was considered in this study to be con -\ntingent on that of VA itself although it may not always be \ntrue. Indeed, a large proportion of caregivers who knew \nVA did not know VAD. This study, together with others \n[22, 28], reveals serious gaps in knowledge of VAD across \ndifferent societies in LICs and calls for stronger edu -\ncational action. Consumption of a poor variety of food \ntopped the caregivers\u2019 causes of VAD while inadequate \ndietary VA intake, a more direct and presumably a readily \ndiscernible cause, was of negligible proportion.\nEye problems (physical and functional defects) are the \nclassic VAD signs/symptoms [ 28, 34] unlike frequent \ninfections and variable skin conditions [ 35] which are \nnon-specific. Infections have a vicious relationship with \nVA [ 35, 36]. The ability of caregivers to correctly recog -\nnize VAD in children is essential in its control, however, \nthey were scarcely competent. These findings are consis -\ntent with those of Hadzi et al. [ 30] in exposing the danger \nof the hidden but prevalent sub-clinical VAD [ 5, 21].\nPage 8 of 10\nMangusho et al. BMC Nutrition            (2024) 10:85 \nFinally, caregiver participation in VAD prevention \nis recommended. Although fortunately some caregiv -\ners knew appropriate prevention measures, the limited \nknowledge of both VAD (Table\u00a0 3) and the right foods \n(Table\u00a0 4) would be a discount. Improving the knowledge \nof VA-rich foods and VAD among caregivers potentially \nnarrows this gap. Use of VA supplements and a nutritious \ndiet, among other methods mentioned, are effective but \nproblematic due to the former\u2019s high cost and non-food \nnature [ 37, 38] and poor understanding of the latter.\nPredictors of VANK\nIn this study, age of caregiver and educational attainment \nwere found to be predictive of VANK. Level of formal \neducation attained was a positive predictor of VANK. \nThis was in agreement with other studies [ 13, 26, 27]. \nEducation was indicated according to formal educational \ncategories, which reflected to years of schooling: primary \nand below (0\u20137), lower secondary (8\u201311), upper second -\nary and beyond ( \u2265 12). This study strengthens the others \nwhich suggest that formal education directly or indi -\nrectly contributes to health-related knowledge through \nincreased exposure and ability to comprehend and apply \npertinent information. Generally, maternal education \ncorrelates positively with child survival through better \nhealthcare practices [ 39],\u00a0 and knowledge could play an \nimportant intermediary role.\nConcerning age, caregivers above 35 had greater odds \nof moderate or high VANK than those who were a decade \nyounger. These findings show that a ten-year age differ -\nence among caregivers of preschool children is signifi -\ncant in terms of VANK and point to a role of experience \nin child care. The senior caregivers have possibly had \n3\u201310 more rounds of pre-school child-care experience \nthan the junior ones. It\u2019s argued that accumulated expe -\nriences increase particular knowledge [ 40]. Accordingly, \nolder caregivers are wont to possess greater knowledge \nthan their juniors due to their longer participation in, \nfor example, the national twice-yearly VAS programme, \ninteraction with the healthcare system/professionals \nand peers, and self-discovery through the child-feeding \nchores.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study concerns caregivers\u2019 knowledge of VA, a key \nnutrient for the health and growth of children. Stud -\nies in this area are quite rare. Caregivers are essential in \nchildren\u2019s nutrition, and their knowledge of VA is cru -\ncial. The findings from this study are important for the \neffective engagement of caregivers for the prevention of \nVAD among children with the potential of reducing the \nreliance on expensive VAS. However, there were some \nlimitations. The scope did not fully cater for the wide \nethnic and cultural diversity in Eastern Uganda although the sociodemographic and economic characteristics are \nlargely the same for rural areas in Uganda. Also, only \ncaregivers who knew or had heard of VA were asked \nabout VAD, thereby excluding data from caregivers who \nprobably knew VAD independently of VA. The study \nrelied on caregivers for estimation of certain variables \nsuch as education level, age, and income and could not \ntherefore control the level of precision even though deep \nprobing was employed in data collection. Finally, the \npower of the study was limited by the small sample size. \nHowever, stratified sampling and individual-level analysis \nmade the study stronger.\nConclusion\nThe objectives of this study were to assess the VA-related \nnutrition knowledge (VANK) and identify its gaps and \npredictors among caregivers of preschool-age children. \nThe caregivers possessed very low (only about 20%) \nVANK. Therefore, there was an 80% gap in VANK among \ncaregivers of preschool children aged 24\u201359 months. \nMore than half of caregivers had no VANK whatsoever. \nThere was a lack of deep knowledge of VA as only nearly \na quarter of all caregivers knew any other aspect con -\ncerning VA including VA/pro-VA-rich foods and causes, \nsigns/symptoms and prevention of VAD. The key pre -\ndictors were caregiver\u2019s age and educational level and \nVANK appeared to increase with both. This study rec -\nommends deliberate efforts to promote knowledge of VA \nand related aspects among caregivers of preschoolers in \nrural areas where VAD is a problem. More attention is \nneeded for the younger and less-educated caregivers to \nnarrow the gaps in VANK. Enhanced VANK among care -\ngivers will strengthen VAD control and contribute to the \nachievement of SDG 2 and other nutrition-related goals. \nMore studies, including the formulation and regulariza -\ntion of precise nomenclature for VA and related aspects \nin local dialects, are needed to further investigate VANK \npredictors among caregivers in varying contexts and \nalso to improve VAD control policy formulation and \neffectiveness.\nAbbreviations\nFAO  Food & Agriculture Organization\nHBM  Health Belief Model\nKAP  Knowledge Attitudes and Practices\nLC  Local Council\nLIC  Low-Income Country\nMUREC  Mildmay Uganda Research Ethical Committee\nSDG  Sustainable Development Goal\nUNCST  Uganda National Council for Science & Technology\nVA  Vitamin A\nVAD  Vitamin A Deficiency\nVANK  Vitamin A-related Nutrition Knowledge\nVAS  Vitamin A Supplementation\nDGLVs  Dark Green Leafy Vegetables\nVTRs  Vegetables, Tubers and Roots\nPage 9 of 10\nMangusho et al.
