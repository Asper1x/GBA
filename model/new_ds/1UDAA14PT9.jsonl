The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of mucosal immunity in\ndefending against infectious agents. Vitamin A is known to influence the production of secretory\nimmunoglobulin A (SIgA) predominantly in the gut, where it is a critical component of the first line\nof defense on mucosal surfaces. Methods: This cross-sectional study, conducted 14 days post-positive\nCOVID-19 diagnosis, aimed to determine the relationship between the nutritional status of vitamin\nA and SIgA levels in COVID-19 outpatients. Serum and saliva samples were collected. Vitamin\nA nutritional status was determined based on the assessment of dietary intake and the analysis of\nretinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4). SIgA levels were analyzed from salivary samples. In addition, serum\nantibodies were analyzed. Results: Dietary vitamin A intake and RBP4 levels positively correlated\nwith SIgA. Patients with higher vitamin A intake showed higher SIgA/IgG1 and SIgA/IgG3 ratios,\nwhile those with higher RBP4 levels showed higher SIgA/IgM, SIgA/IgG1, and SIgA/IgG2 ratios.\nConclusions: These findings underscore a significant correlation between vitamin A nutritional\nstatus and SIgA levels in COVID-19 outpatients, which may suggest the potential importance of\nmaintaining optimal vitamin A levels for the prevention of viral infections.\nKeywords: vitamin A; retinol-binding protein; secretory IgA; antibodies; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2;\nrespiratory tract infections\n1. Introduction\nRespiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the main cause of primary care visits. Although\nupper RTIs generally cause mild symptoms, they can occasionally lead to severe compli-\ncations. However, lower RTIs are responsible for a significant number of deaths, ranking\nfourth among the leading causes of mortality worldwide [ 1\u20133]. More than three years after\nidentifying the respiratory virus responsible for COVID-19, officials declared the end of\nthe health emergency [ 4,5]. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 remains worrisome because of its\ntendency to mutate into variants with augmented transmission capabilities, and it may\npose a threat to evading immunity triggered by vaccines or past infections [5].\nJ. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 1538. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13061538 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\nJ. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 1538 2 of 15\nDue to the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, the immune response of the\nrespiratory mucosa is crucial in the defense against infectious agents, where secretory\nimmunoglobulin A (SIgA) is produced in considerable amounts [ 6,7]. In this sense, it\nhas been suggested that targeting the production of SIgA may be an effective strategy for\npreventing respiratory infections [8\u201310].\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble compound acquired through the ingestion of foods abundant\nin retinol, retinol esters, or carotenoids [ 11]. Its metabolism results in the production of\nretinoic acid (RA), which when bound to its nuclear receptors acts as a transcription factor\nthat regulates the expression of different genes, some of which serve functions within the\nimmune system. Vitamin A plays a critical role in mucosal immunity, where RA has been\ndocumented to contribute to the class switch to IgA in gut-associated lymphoid tissues\n(GALTs) [11,12].\nSince the recognition of the relevance of vitamin A in treating measles, researchers\nhave investigated the close connection between vitamin A deficiency and respiratory\ninfection incidence [ 13,14]. Preclinical studies have shown that Wistar rats which were\nfed a vitamin A-deficient diet had lower SIgA concentrations than those in the control\ngroup [ 15]. Similarly, mice that were intranasally inoculated with influenza virus and\nprovided a vitamin A-rich diet or vitamin A supplements had higher concentrations of\nSIgA compared to the control group [16\u201318].\nOn the other hand, although less explored to date, investigations in human serum sam-\nples have recorded a positive correlation between retinol concentrations and the IgA/IgM\nratio as an indicator of class switch recombination [ 19]. In addition, a correlation has been\ndocumented between the concentrations of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), which is the\nmain vitamin A transporter protein, and IgA concentrations [20].\nSince SIgA is the predominant isoform of this antibody on mucosal surfaces, this study\naimed to determine the relationship between the nutritional status of vitamin A, assessed\nby dietary vitamin A intake and RBP4 concentrations, and SIgA levels in COVID-19 outpa-\ntients. The study findings demonstrated a direct correlation of dietary vitamin A intake\nand RBP4 with SIgA.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Design and Patients\nFourteen days post-diagnosis of COVID-19 in the patients, a cross-sectional assessment\nwas carried out. Patients were recruited between January and March 2022 during the critical\nperiod for infections in Mexico attributed to the Omicron variant. Patient selection was\nperformed at the Laboratorio de Diagn \u00f3stico de Enfermedades Emergentes y Reemergentes\n(LaDEER) at the Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS) de la Universidad de\nGuadalajara (UdeG). Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was established through RT-PCR using\nthe DeCoV19 Kit Triplex assay kit (Genes2Life G2L-DeCoV19-MP , Guanajuato, Mexico).\nIdentification of SARS-CoV-2 variants was also performed using the Master Mut Kit assay\n(Genes2Life G2LMUSC-14, Guanajuato, Mexico) as previously described [ 21]. The LaDEER\neligibility criteria for RT-PCR testing of suspected COVID-19 patients has previously been\npublished in greater detail [22,23].\nThe calculation of the sample size was conducted using Cohen\u2019s formula for hy-\npothesis testing of the correlation coefficient [ 24], wherein the correlation reported by\nJones BG et al. [20], served as a reference. A sample size of 33 patients was determined\nwith 80% power and 95% confidence. After confirming COVID-19, people between 18 and\n60 years old were invited to participate in the study. Individuals with malabsorption dis-\neases, immunosuppression, autoimmune diseases, lactating or pregnant women, those with\na body mass index \u226418.5 kg/m2or\u226539.9 kg/m2, and those who had consumed vitamin\nsupplements within the previous two weeks were not included in the study. Patients who\nconsented to participate in the study were provided with an informed consent form that\nincluded a thorough description of their participation, possible risks, benefits, and contact\ndetails. The current research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki\nJ. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 1538 3 of 15\nand authorized by the CUCS Research, Research Ethics, and Biosafety Committees under\nopinion number CI-04621, date of 11 October 2021.\n2.2. Data Collection\nPatients were invited to LaDEER for assessment 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nSociodemographic, clinical data, and vital signs were collected from each patient. The pres-\nence of 23 symptoms and their rating according to the Wong\u2013Baker scale were evaluated.\nBody temperature was assessed utilizing an infrared thermometer (Yuwell YT-1C, Yuwell-\nJiangsu Yuyue Medical Equipment & Supply, Shanghai, China), while oxygen saturation\nwas monitored using a digital pulse oximeter (Sonolife LMT-01, Sonolife, Shanghai, China).\nHeart rate and blood pressure were recorded via a digital sphygmomanometer (Omron\nHEM-7120, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan).\n2.3. Analysis of Serum Samples\nBlood sample collection was performed through venipuncture after 8 to 12 h of fasting.\nA vacuum system was used to draw blood, which was deposited in two 6 mL tubes\nwithout anticoagulant. Blood samples were processed for serum separation. Aliquots were\nprepared and stored at \u221280\u25e6C until analysis. At all times, precautions were taken to protect\nthe blood and serum samples from direct exposure to light.\nLiver function was evaluated by analyzing transaminases through absorbance pho-\ntometry with BioSystems kits (11531 and 11533, Barcelona, Spain). Additionally, the\nhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentration as an inflammatory biomarker\nwas determined using BioSystems kit 31927 (Barcelona, Spain) through turbidimetry. Fur-\nthermore, the concentration of interleukin 6 (IL-6) was determined using a high-sensitivity\nsandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific\nBMS213HS, Dreieich, Germany). In cases where a sample was found to be outside the\nstandard curve, the measurement was repeated in a 1:3 dilution with the kit sample diluent\nin a volume of 120 \u00b5L, and its concentration was multiplied by a dilution factor of three.\nThe concentration of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF- \u03b21) was determined\nusing the BioLegend 436707 kit (San Diego, CA, USA), employing a sandwich ELISA\nmethod. The TGF- \u03b21 activation protocol was followed as directed by the manufacturer,\nalthough the sample dilution was modified to 1:100 with the kit\u2019s sample diluent in a 300 \u00b5L\nvolume. The concentration was multiplied by a dilution factor of 200 in the final calculation.\nIn addition, the total levels of IgA, IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 isotypes were de-\ntermined employing a bead based multiplex immunoassay (Bio-Rad 171A3100M, Hercules,\nCA, USA), in accordance with the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. The inhibition\nrate of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) for SARS-CoV-2 (RBD) was determined by a blocking\nELISA (GenScript cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization kit (Piscataway, NJ, USA)), following\nthe original protocol.\nThe concentration of RBP4 was assessed as a surrogate for retinol. For this, a sandwich\nELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific BMS2199, Dreieich, Germany) following the manufac-\nturer\u2019s guidelines was employed. The concentration categories used for classification\nwere as follows: deficiency, <16 \u00b5g/mL; insufficiency, 16 to 22 \u00b5g/mL; and sufficiency,\n>22\u00b5g/mL [20,25].\n2.4. Analysis of Salivary Samples\nEach patient was instructed to attend the appointment without having previously\nexercised, smoked, chewed gum, or drank alcohol or coffee. Patients were asked to have\ntheir mouths rinsed with drinking water, and, after a 10 min period, saliva was collected\nfrom their mouths. Approximately 2 mL of saliva was collected from each patient in a\n50 mL conical tube. To achieve this, patients were instructed to tilt their heads forward,\nbring the tube to their mouths, and gently guide saliva into the tube until the required\nvolume was reached.\nJ. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 1538 4 of 15\nAlthough 14 days had elapsed since COVID-19 diagnosis, the salivary samples were\ninactivated based on a previously reported protocol [ 26]. For this, 10% Triton X-100\n(Sigma-Aldrich T8787, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) with PBS was applied, and\nthe inactivation reagent was added to each saliva aliquot to achieve a final dilution of 1%.\nSubsequently, saliva aliquots were incubated with Triton X-100 at room temperature for\none hour and stored at \u221280\u25e6C until analysis.\nThe salivary SIgA concentration was analyzed using a sandwich ELISA method\n(Abnova KA3980, Taipei, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Prior to\nanalysis, the samples were thawed and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min to remove\nsalivary particles that may have interfered with the assay. The ratio of SIgA to the other\nisotypes was analyzed to monitor class switching, as previously reported [19].\n2.5. Assessment of Nutrient Intake\nThe dietary nutrient intake assessment relied on the 24 h dietary recall (24HR) method\nof a previous day. The first 24HR was obtained via video call after the patients had\nconsented to participate in the study. The second 24HR was recorded during the evaluation\nappointment. A photographic food album was employed as a visual support to aid patients\nin describing their food portions [ 27]. The food amounts, measured in grams, obtained\nfrom both 24HR were entered into the Nutritionist Pro software v7.9 from Axxya Systems\n(Redmond, WA, USA) to compute the average nutrient intake. The residual method was\nused to adjust for the total energy intake [28].\nThe vitamin A dietary intake of each patient was compared with the estimated average\nrequirement (EAR: 500 \u00b5g RAE for women; 625 \u00b5g RAE for men) and the recommended\ndietary allowance (RDA: 700 \u00b5g RAE for women; 900 \u00b5g RAE for men) outlined in the\nguidelines of the U.S. Institute of Medicine [29].\n2.6. Statistical Analysis\nThe data underwent analysis employing the statistical packages IBM SPSS Statistics\n(version 25.0, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism (version 7.0, San Diego, CA, USA)\nwith a predetermined statistical significance threshold of <0.05. A Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was\nconducted to assess the normality of the data. The numerical variables were presented\nusing medians with quartiles Q1 and Q3, while categorical variables were expressed as\nfrequencies and percentages.\nFor between-group comparisons, patients were divided into two groups based on\nwhether they met the EAR for vitamin A (intake below the EAR vs. intake above the EAR).\nPatients were similarly grouped based on RBP4 concentration, labeled as \u201cinsufficient\u201d\nor \u201csufficient\u201d. Box-and-whisker plots were used to show the data, displaying medians\nand interquartile range (Q3\u2013Q1). Comparisons between groups were analyzed using the\nMann\u2013Whitney Utest.\nAdditionally, a correlation analysis was conducted using Spearman\u2019s correlation\ncoefficient ( rs). Subsequently, SIgA levels were categorized as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d based on\nmedian values. An ROC curve analysis was then performed to determine the optimal\ncutoff value, sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio (+LR) of vitamin A intake\nand RBP4 concentration in discriminating a high SIgA response.\n3. Results\n3.1. Clinical, Biochemical, and Nutritional Characteristics\nA total of 39 outpatients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 14 days earlier\nwere assessed. All patients (100%) were infected with the Omicron variant. Among them,\nCOVID-19 was reported to have been experienced for the first time by 84.6% of the patients.\nNotable persistent symptoms included phlegm (69.2%), cough (64.1%), headache (59%),\nconstipation (48.7%), and weakness (48.7%).\nCOVID-19 vaccination had already been received by most patients (97.4%). The most\nfrequently used vaccines were Pfizer/BioNTech (31.6%) and CanSino (31.6%). Additionally,\nJ. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 1538 5 of 15\nit was reported by all vaccinated patients that the complete vaccination schedule had\nbeen received. Serum analysis revealed an IL-6 concentration of 0.89 (0.77) pg/mL and an\nhs-CRP level of 1.73 (3.48) mg/L (Table 1).\nTable 1.

This vitamin\nwas found to be consumed at a level of 511.36 (354.71) \u00b5g RAE, with 252.28 (265.47) \u00b5g\noriginating from retinol and 111.61 (435.58) \u00b5g from carotenoids (Table 2). It was observed\nthat the EAR of vitamin A was not met by 48.8% of the patients, while 79.5% did not reach\nthe RDA of this vitamin. The concentration of RBP4 was 26.77 (17.96) \u00b5g/mL. Based on the\nRBP4 classification in Table 1, it was noted that concentrations below the sufficiency levels\nwere exhibited by 35.9% of patients.\nJ. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 1538 6 of 15\nTable 2.

In this analysis, the concentration of RBP4 was similar be-\ntween both groups (25.87 vs. 25.73 \u00b5g/mL) as depicted in Figure 1A. Similarly, patients with\nvitamin A intake below the EAR displayed an IgA concentration of 752.38 (371.85) \u00b5g/mL ,\nwhile those with intake above the EAR had a concentration of 734.97 (284.54) \u00b5g/mL,\nevidencing no significant difference (Figure 1C). In contrast, patients with an intake of\nvitamin A above the EAR showed a significantly higher concentration of SIgA compared to\nthose classified as having an intake of this vitamin below the EAR (183.1 vs. 140.75 \u00b5g/mL,\np= 0.028) (Figure 1B). No differences were found between groups concerning the other\nisotypes (Figure 1). Regarding the symptom score, patients with vitamin A intake below\nthe EAR reported higher scores than those with vitamin A intake above the EAR (20.5 vs.\n10 points); however, this difference was not significant ( p= 0.095).\nJ.

Discussion\nThe results of the current study demonstrate a significant prevalence of suboptimal\nvitamin A intake and insufficient RBP4 concentrations in COVID-19 outpatients. However,\nboth vitamin A intake and RBP4 concentrations were found to be directly correlated\nwith SIgA. Furthermore, patients with higher vitamin A consumption exhibited a higher\nSIgA/IgG1 and SIgA/IgG3 ratio, while those with higher RBP4 concentrations showed a\nhigher SIgA/IgM, SIgA/IgG1, and SIgA/IgG2 ratio.\nVitamin A deficiency remains among the top nutritional deficiencies worldwide,\nespecially in developing populations [ 30]. Nutritional transition in recent decades has\nbeen characterized by the consumption of ultra-processed foods [ 31]. The intake of such\nfood has been associated with a decreased provision of essential micronutrients for human\nhealth, such as vitamin A [ 32]. In a report derived from the Encuesta Nacional de Salud y\nNutrici \u00f3n (National Health and Nutrition Survey) 2012 in the Mexican population, it was\nobserved that a diet based on ultra-processed food results in a 50% lower intake of vitamin\nA compared to a diet based on unprocessed or minimally processed food [ 33]. Likewise,\nprevious research in the Mexican population has reported a high prevalence of insufficient\nvitamin A intake [22,34,35], which is in accordance with the present study.\nThe leading cause of vitamin A deficiency is insufficient intake of retinol and carotenoid\nfood sources [ 11,14]. RBP4 is often used as a surrogate for retinol to determine vitamin A\nnutritional status [ 20,36]. However, both retinol concentration and RBP4 synthesis can be\ncompromised in acute inflammatory processes, as demonstrated in patients hospitalized\nfor COVID-19 [ 37\u201339]. According to previous reports, the acute-phase response of mild\nCOVID-19 has a duration of approximately 5 to 9 days [ 40,41]. In the present study, more\nthan one-third of the patients had insufficient RBP4 concentration even though the time\nelapsed, at the time of evaluation, had already passed the acute phase of infection.\nIn addition to contributing to visual health, vitamin A has fundamental functions in\nthe immune system response [ 11,14]. Studies have reported that low intake and low serum\nconcentration of vitamin A have been associated with respiratory tract infections [ 42,43].\nFurthermore, according to Sirisinha et al. [ 15], Wistar rats assigned to a vitamin A-deficient\ndiet exhibited lower concentrations of SIgA in intestinal samples compared to the control\ngroup. The previously mentioned is similar to what was reported in the present study,\nwhere patients with vitamin A intake below the EAR and insufficient RBP4 concentrations\nhad lower SIgA levels. As discussed in previous reviews, RA\u2014an active metabolite of\nvitamin A\u2014can act alone and in combination with other stimuli to promote germinal\ncenters, resulting in enhanced antibody response, especially of the IgA class [ 44]. More\nrecently, it has been suggested that RA, in conjunction with the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)\nand retinoid X receptor (RXR), bind directly to the \u03b1-switch region of the Ig heavy chain\ngene to facilitate activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) activity to promote class\nswitching to IgA antibodies [12].\nJ. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 1538 11 of 15\nThe above has been observed predominantly in GALT; however, several preclini-\ncal studies have shown that mice inoculated intranasally with a respiratory virus and\nsubsequently assigned to a vitamin A-rich diet or vitamin A supplementation exhibit a\nbetter SIgA response compared to the control group [ 16\u201318]. In addition, intranasal retinol\nadministration improved the SIgA response in nasal washes in vitamin A-deficient mice\ninoculated with a respiratory virus [ 45]. In this regard, it has been proposed that vitamin A\nalso has a close relationship with the SIgA response in the respiratory tract for airborne\nvirus infection prevention. According to Rudraraju et al. [ 46], aldehyde dehydrogenase 1\n(ALDH1A), which is involved in the metabolism of retinal to RA, is constitutively expressed\nin upper and lower respiratory tract epithelial cells. They also described that these cells\ncould produce cytokines that, in synergy with RA, over-regulate IgA production in this\ntissue [46].\nConsistent with the above, a direct correlation of vitamin A and RBP4 with SIgA was\nidentified in the present study. SIgA in this study was analyzed from salivary samples. As\nhas been reviewed in other studies, nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) corresponds\nto the inductive site of IgA+plasmablasts that migrate to the salivary glands, where\nplasmablasts differentiate into IgA-producing plasma cells [ 47]. However, the formation\nof ectopic germinal centers in the salivary glands has also been proposed [ 48]. Likewise,\nit has been suggested that GALT contributes significantly to the expansion and class\nswitch to IgA+plasmablasts, which then migrate to the salivary glands. The migration of\nplasmablasts is controlled by their expression of integrins and chemokine receptors [ 49\u201351].\nThe previously mentioned factors could explain the positive correlation between dietary\nintake of vitamin A and RBP4 with salivary SIgA identified in the present study, since\nvitamin A is essential in the production of IgA in GALT [ 12], and retinol could be directly\nmetabolized in the epithelial cells of NALT to favor class switching [46].\nAlthough it is generally accepted that the mucosal and systemic immune systems act\nseparately in the humoral response [ 47], studies in patients immunized against SARS-CoV-2\nintramuscularly have shown anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of the SIgA class in saliva sam-\nples [ 8,52]. Exactly how intramuscular administration of vaccines induces the mucosal\nSIgA response is not known at this time; however, it has been suggested that vaccination\nmay generate a mucosal IgA response in the intestine and that plasma cells generated in\nthe intestine may migrate into the oral cavity [ 52]. Similarly, it has been suggested that\nB cells from peripheral lymph nodes could mobilize to the mucosa under the influence\nof their homing receptors to differentiate into plasma cells and secrete SIgA [ 8,53]. In\nthe present study, a positive correlation was identified between vitamin A intake and\nthe SIgA/IgG1 and SIgA/IgG3 ratio. In turn, RBP4 was positively correlated with the\nSIgA/IgM, SIgA/IgG1, and SIgA/IgG2 ratios. Therefore, considering that nearly all evalu-\nated patients had been previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, it is hypothesized\nthat vitamin A may have promoted class switching at the systemic level, leading to the\nproduction of IgA+plasmablasts which could be subsequently mobilized to the site of\ninfection for SIgA production.\nAccording to a previous report, RBP4 correlated with IgA, IgA/IgM, and IgA/IgG1 in\nserum samples [ 20]; however, in the present study, these correlations were not replicated. In\nfact, RBP4 correlated negatively with serum IgA. The above could support the hypothesis\nthat after the class switching, there is an increased migration of IgA+plasmablasts to\neffector sites in the airways to favor SIgA production. However, it should not rule out the\npossibility that RBP4 could be redistributed to the infection sites to directly promote the\nrelease of retinol, which, when metabolized, favors SIgA production in the salivary glands\nsince, in the present study, a positive correlation of RBP4 with SIgA was identified.\nFurthermore, an exploratory analysis was performed to determine the correlation of\nvitamin A nutritional status with COVID-19 symptomatology; however, no significant\ncorrelations of dietary vitamin A intake and RBP4 levels with symptom score were identi-\nfied. Likewise, SIgA did not correlate with symptom score. Thus, the potential protective\nJ. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 1538 12 of 15\nrole of SIgA against COVID-19 symptomatology in outpatients was not established in the\npresent study.\nTo our understanding, this is the first study in which both dietary vitamin A intake\nand RBP4 concentrations are evaluated together to determine their correlation with SIgA in\nhuman biological samples. In addition, the samples were collected within the period when\nSIgA kinetics peak after a natural respiratory tract infection. However, in the present study,\nit was not possible to assess salivary SIgA specific to SARS-CoV-2 because there was no kit\navailable. This assay could have provided valuable information since it corresponds directly\nto SIgA with neutralizing activity. Also, all patients had already been exposed to the antigen\n(vaccinated or previous COVID-19), so they could have mounted an immune response\ndifferent from the primary response, which could also have masked the correlation of IL-6\nand TGF- \u03b21 with SIgA. On the other hand, apo-RBP4 is found in circulation, although to a\nmuch lesser extent than holo-RBP4 (15% vs. 85%) [ 36]; therefore, it is considered relevant\nto include in other studies the analysis of retinol directly as a biomarker of vitamin A\nnutritional status.\nPreviously, meeting the daily RDA of vitamin A has been proposed as a prophylac-\ntic intervention for respiratory infections. In addition, in cases of mild COVID-19, the\nadministration of mega doses of 60,000 \u00b5g of RAE (200,000 IU) of vitamin A for two con-\nsecutive days has been suggested to promote antibody response [ 54], which is similar\nto measles treatment in children [ 13]. According to previous studies, the use of RA as a\nvaccine adjuvant has been suggested [ 55\u201357], which could be crucial in second-generation\noral and nasal vaccine formulation for SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging and reemerging\nviruses. Likewise, the stabilization of sufficient retinol concentrations before respiratory\nvirus seasonality, either through a healthy diet or supplementation, could be an appropriate\nstrategy for respiratory tract infection prevention.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, dietary vitamin A intake and RBP4 concentration were correlated with\nSIgA. Furthermore, patients with higher vitamin A intake exhibited a higher SIgA/IgG1 and\nSIgA/IgG3 ratio, whereas those with higher RBP4 concentrations showed higher SIgA/IgM,\nSIgA/IgG1, and SIgA/IgG2 ratios. Therefore, although the present study cannot establish\ncausality, it is suggested that nutritional vitamin A status may be a pivotal contributor to\nthe SIgA response in preventing the incidence and progression of respiratory infections.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.J.T.-H. and J.F.M.-V .; data curation, F.J.T.-H.; formal\nanalysis, F.J.T.-H.; funding acquisition, J.F.M.-V .; investigation, F.J.T.-H., S.G.-A., L.E.H.-J., D.L.P .-B.,\nH.R.C.-G., F.N. and G.M.-R.; methodology, F.J.T.-H.; project administration, J.F.M.-V .; resources,\nG.G.-E. , F.M.-S., N.V .-M., F.N. and J.F.M.-V .; supervision, F.M.-S. and J.F.M.-V .; verification, F.J.T.-H. ,\nS.G.-A. and J.F.M.-V .; visualization, F.J.T.-H.; writing\u2014original draft, F.J.T.-H.; writing\u2014review\nand editing, F.N. and J.F.M.-V .
