Therefore, it is critical to develop and test new therapeutic agents that are anabolic for the TMJ cartilage and subchondral bone. Thus, agents which modify both the carti-lage and subchondral bone are promising for TMJ-OA, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alendronate. Given the severity of TMJ-OA and the unique nature of the osteo-chondral tissues of the TMJ, it is not likely that a single thera-peutic agent will be able, on its own, to promote or restore the anabolic responses in TMJ-OA. Accordingly, identifying sig-nals that can synergize to produce anabolic functions in the cartilage and subchondral bone are essential for the develop-ment of clinically feasible treatments for TMJ-OA.\nThe cells in the TMJ cartilage expresses Collagen type 1 \n(Col1a1), Collagen type 2 (Col2a1), and Collagen type 10 (Col10a1).\n3 Usually Col2a1 is found in the knee cartilage,4 \nand Col1a1 is predominantly expressed in the bone.5 Col1a1 1109229 CarXXX10.1177/19476035221109229CartilageChen et al.\nresearch-article 2022 2022\n1Division of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, UConn Health, \nFarmington, Ct, USa\n2Department of Developmental Sciences, Marquette University School \nof Dentistry, Milwaukee, Wi, USa\n*Po-Jung Chen is now affiliated to  Department of growth and \nDevelopment, College of Dentistry-University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska\nCorresponding Author:\nSumit Yadav, Department of Orthodontics, School of Dental Medicine, UConn Health, 263 Farmington avenue, MC1725, Farmington, Ct 06030, USa. email: syadav@uchc.eduAnabolic Response of Intermittent \nParathyroid Hormone and Alendronate  on the Osteochondral Tissue of TMJ\nPo-Jung Chen1, Ke Wang1, Shivam Mehta2, Mara H. O\u2019Brien1,  \nCaroline N. Dealy1, Eliane H. Dutra1, and Sumit Yadav1\nAbstract\nObjective. to characterize the effects of parathyroid hormone (PtH) and alendronate (alend) on the osteochondral tissue \nof temporomandibular joint (tMJ). Materials and Methods. Ninety-six male and female transgenic reporter mice, 4 to 5 \nweeks old were divided into 6 groups: (1) Control group: Saline was injected daily for 14 days; (2) PtH: PtH was injected daily for 14 days; (3) alend: alend was injected every alternate days for 14 days; (4) Combined PtH and alend: PtH was injected daily and alend injected every alternate days for 14 days; (5) PtH then alend: PtH was injected daily for 14 days \nfollowed by alend injections in alternate days for 14 days; and (6) PtH wait alend: PtH was injected daily for 14 days. \nthere was a waiting period of 1 week before administration of alend in alternate days for 14 days. Mice were injected with 5-ethnyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (edU), 48 and 24 hours prior to euthanization. Results. there was significant increase in bone volume and decrease in osteoclastic activity in groups in which alend was administered after PtH in both gender. there was significant increase in cartilage thickness with PtH or alend alone in females, whereas in males, PtH alone led to increase in cartilage thickness. Chondrocyte apoptosis was significantly decreased with PtH or alend alone in both male and female. Matrix metallopeptidase 13, and aggreganase-2 (aDaMtS5) expression were significantly decreased with PtH and alend alone in both gender. Conclusion. PtH and alend administration causes anabolic effects in the osteochondral \ntissue of tMJ.\nKeywords\nmandibular condylar cartilage, parathyroid hormone, alendronate, temporomandibular joint\n172 CaRTilage 13(4) \ncells are predominantly located in the proliferative zone of \nthe TMJ cartilage,6 and Col10a1 cells are located in the \nhypertrophic zone of the TMJ cartilage.6-9\nIntermittent administration of PTH (I-PTH) is a United \nStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved ana-bolic treatment for osteoporosis in clinical practice. Our pre-vious data suggest that I-PTH promotes an anabolic effect at the mandibular condyle of mice, and there was significant increase in the cartilage thickness with the I-PTH administra-tion.\n10 In fact, I-PTH is commonly used in association with \nanti-resorptive agent bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis,\n11,12 whereas the effects of this treatment modal-\nity in TMJ osteoarthritis are largely unknown. Therefore, it is now crucial to determine the effects of this combination in the cartilage and subchondral bone of the TMJ and its under -\npinning molecular mechanisms.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no study compar -\ning the individual and synergistic effects of the I-PTH and alendronate on the cartilage and the subchondral bone of the TMJ. The purpose of this project was to study whether the use of I-PTH and alendronate together would provide a therapeutic advantage by combining different mechanism and have an anabolic effect on the cartilage and the sub-chondral bone. Our objective was to determine the effects of I-PTH and alendronate treatment on the microarchitec-ture of the cartilage and the subchondral bone of the TMJ. In addition, we also studied the effects of independent and simultaneous treatment with I-PTH and alendronate.\nMaterials and Methods\nethical Statement\nAll the experimental protocol used in this research involving \ntriple transgenic reporter mice were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of the University of Connecticut Health Center. Our study followed the ARRIVE guidelines for in vivo experiments using these mice.\nTriple Transgenic Mice\nNinety-six 4- to 5-week-old male and female triple trans-genic reporter mice (Col1a1 \u00d7 Col2a1 \u00d7 Col10a1) on a CD-1 background\n6,13 were used for this study. The Col1a1-\nGFP cyan contains a 3.6-kb fragment of the rat type 1 col-lagen promoter that is strongly expressed in bone and the mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC). The Col2a1-CFP contains a 1-kb fragment of the type 2-collagen promoter that is expressed in the pre-hypertrophic zone of the MCC. The Col10a1-RFP is fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and is expressed in the hypertrophic zone of the MCC.In Vivo Study Design\nAll the mice received subcutaneous injection of saline or PTH [1-34] (60 \u03bcg/kg body weight, Prospec, East Brunswick, NJ, USA) or/and Alendronate (Alend, alendro-nate sodium trihydrate, 50 \u03bcg/kg, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\nMice were divided into 6 groups and equal number of \nmales and female mice were used in each group (n = 8 male \nand 8 female per group). Groups were divided as described below:\n1. Control group: Saline was injected daily for 14 days;\n2. PTH group: PTH was injected daily for 14 days;\n3. Alendronate (Alend) group: Alendronate was injected every alternate day for 14 days;\n4. Combined PTH and Alend group: PTH was injected daily combined with Alend injected every alternate days for 14 days;\n5. PTH then Alend group: PTH only was injected daily for 14 days followed by Alend only injections in alternate days for another 14 day;\n6. PTH wait Alend group: PTH only was injected daily for 14 days. There was a waiting period of 1 week before initiation of Alend only injections in alternate days for another 14 days (Fig. 1).\nWe used these experimental groups as we wanted to \nclearly decipher the effects with different combinations of I-PTH and alendronate. Furthermore, we needed to deter -\nmine how alendronate can be optimally used in conjunction with I-PTH for the anabolic effects. Mice were injected with EdU (5-ethnyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY , USA) (30 mg/kg body weight) 48 and 24 hours prior to euthanization. All animals in the control and experimental groups were healthy and gained weight during the entire duration of the study. All mice were euthanized 24 hours after the last injection of EdU.\nFigure 1.

The MCC along with subchondral bone were fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours, placed in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight, then embed-ded in cryomedium (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) using disposable base molds (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The medial surfaces of the samples were embedded parallel to the floor and against the base of the mold. Specimens were stored at \u201320\u00b0C until sectioning with a Leica cryostat (Nussloch, Germany). Transfer of fro-zen sagittal sections of the condyles (5-7 \u03bcm) to slides was completed with tape transfer method.\n14\nMicro\u2013computerized tomography (Micro-CT)\nThe MCC and subchondral bone of condyles were ana-\nlyzed using micro-CT (SCANCO Medical AG, Bru\u0308ttisellen, Switzerland) at 55 kV and 145 \u03bc A, with a \nvoxel size of 6 \u03bc m. The samples (n  = 8 per group) were \nscanned in 70% alcohol, and serial tomographic projec-tions were acquired at 1,000 projections per rotation at 300,000 \u03bcs. An automated algorithm using local thresh-\nold segmented the reconstructed gray scale images to dis-tinguish calcified tissue from non-calcified tissue (Scanco \nMicroCT software). The mushroom-shaped condylar head was the region of interest. Bone volume fraction (BVF [%]) was assessed.\nHistomorphometry and Histological Staining\nOur histological sections were stained and analyzed as previously described. The 5 to 7 \u03bc m sagittal sections of \nmandibular condyles were adhered to glass slides through the entire processes of staining and imaging. The sections were first imaged for fluorescent signals Col1a1 (green) and Col10a1 (red). Baseline imaging of the sections was performed with an observer ZI fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY , USA) using a yellow fluo-rescent protein filter (eYFP, Chroma Cat 49003ET, EX: \n500/20, EM: 535/30) and a RFPcherry filter that was also used for detecting alizarin complexone staining (mCherry, Chroma Cat 49009ET, EX: 560/40, EM: 630/75). Subsequently, the coverslip was removed by soaking slides in PBS and stained for EdU (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY , USA) then imaged. Sections were then stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using ELF97 (Life Tech, Waltham, MA, USA), generat-\ning a yellow fluorescent signal. Finally, the slide was rinsed in distilled water then stained with Toluidine blue (TB) and reimaged using bright field microscopy to examine the proteoglycans.We also performed fluorescent TUNEL (R&D systems, \nMinneapolis, MN, USA) as well as immunohistochemistry for degeneration markers, matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5; ThermoFisher).\nHistological analysis and Quantification\nImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to quantify green and red pixels within the cartilage of the mandibular condyle to analyze Col1a1 and Col10a1 expression in sagittal sections of condyles. Percentages were obtained by dividing the number of green or red cells over the total number of 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) cells. Similarly, we examined TRAP activity by dividing the area of yellow pixels over the area of the sub-chondral bone region. EdU and TUNEL were quantified as the ratio of EdU or TUNEL positive cell number to DAPI positive cell in the TMJ cartilage, respectively. The thick-ness of all layers of cartilage was assessed by averaging the measurements at 5 different locations throughout the mid-dle portion of MCC using TB staining.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to examine the distribution of BVF, tissue density, and histological analysis. Statistically significant differences among means were determined by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test. All statistical tests were 2 sided, and a P value of <0.05 was deemed to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was computed using Graph Pad Prism (San Diego, CA, USA).\nResults\nBone Volume and Remodeling\nWe first analyzed bone volume in the MCC and subchon-\ndral bone of condyles of experimental and control mice by Micro-CT. All these 3 types of combination uses of PTH and Alend caused a significant increase in bone volume when compared with PTH alone, in both females and males (females: PTH vs. PTH + Alend: P = 0.005; PTH vs. PTH \nthen Alend: P < 0.05; PTH vs. PTH wait Alend: P = 0.05; \nmales: PTH vs. PTH + Alend: P = 0.001; PTH vs. PTH \nthen Alend: P < 0.005; PTH vs. PTH wait Alend: P < \n0.0005. Figs. 2A, C, and D). We also noticed a significantly \nhigher bone volume in PTH + Alend female group when \ncompared with Alend only (P < 0.05; Fig. 2D).\nBone remodeling was studied by fluorescent TRAP \nstaining. PTH alone led to a significant increase in TRAP activity in relation to saline group in males (PTH vs. Saline: P = 0.01, Fig. 2E). Interestingly, in female mice, the \n174 CaRTilage 13(4) \ncombination uses of Alend and PTH led to a significant \nreduction in TRAP activity in comparison with the saline \ngroup or the PTH group, when the individual use of Alend failed to do so (Saline vs. PTH + Alend: P = 0.001; Saline \nvs. PTH then Alend: P < 0.01; Saline vs. PTH wait Alend: \nP < 0.05; PTH vs. PTH + Alend: P = 0.001; PTH vs. PTH \nthen Alend: P = 0.01; PTH vs. PTH wait Alend: P < 0.05;  \nFig. 2B and F). We also observed a similar trend in males; Alend, when used alone or combined with PTH, signifi-cantly decreased TRAP activity when compared with the PTH group; in addition, PTH + Alend led to a sharp reduc-tion in TRAP activity when compared with saline group (Alend vs. PTH + Alend: P = 0.05; Alend vs. PTH wait \nAlend: P = 0.01; PTH vs. Alend: P < 0.005; PTH vs. PTH \n+ Alend: P < 0.0001; PTH vs. PTH then Alend: P < 0.000; \nPTH vs. PTH wait Alend: P 0.01; Fig. 2B and E). Taken \ntogether, these data suggest that a combined use of PTH \nmay promote the effect of Alendronate in inhibiting the osteoclastic activity, indicating a synergistic effect of the combination of PTH and Alendronate.Cartilage Thickness\nMandibular condyle cartilage thickness was evaluated in TB-stained sections. In female mice, PTH or Alend alone caused a substantial increase in cartilage thickness (PTH vs. Saline: P = 0.01; Alend vs. Saline: P < 0.001; Fig. 3A and \nC). Nevertheless, when these 2 drugs were combined in dif-ferent scenarios, the individual beneficial effects were lost and a decrease in cartilage thickness was observed in females (PTH vs. PTH then Alend: P < 0.0001; PTH vs. \nPTH wait Alend: P < 0.0001; Alend vs. PTH + Alend: P = \n0.01; Alend vs. PTH the Alend: P < 0.0001; Alend vs. PTH \nwait Alend: P < 0.0001, Fig. 3C). In males, PTH alone led \nto a significant increase in cartilage thickness (PTH vs. Saline: P < 0.0001; PTH vs. Alend: P < 0.01; PTH vs. \nPTH then Alend: P < 0.0001; PTH vs. PTH wait Alend:  \nP < 0.0001; Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, Alend alone did not \ninduce a significant change in cartilage thickness, but the combination of PTH + Alend led a greater increase than \nany other groups in which Alend was injected (PTH + Alend vs. Saline: P < 0.001; PTH + Alend vs. Alend: P < \nFigure 2.

In both females and males, PTH or Alend treatment alone reduced chondrocyte apoptosis in comparison with \nFigure 3. Significant increased cartilage thickness after i-PtH administration in male and female. in addition, in males, the cartilage \nthickness was significantly increased with concurrent administration of i-PtH + alendronate, whereas in females, the cartilage \nthickness was increased with administration of alendronate.

Black dotted line is the tidemark area and black vertical lines are the measurement for the cartilage thickness. i-PtH = intermittent administration of PtH; PtH = parathyroid hormone.\nSaline (females: Saline vs. PTH: P  = 0.0005; Saline vs. \nAlend: P < 0.05; males: Saline vs. PTH: P  < 0.0001; Saline \nvs. Alend: P < 0.0001; Fig. 4A, C, and D ). There was no \nstatistical difference between PTH or Alend treatment alone. \nHowever, the combination of PTH +  Alend seems to have \neliminated the individual effects of these drugs in both females and males (females: PTH vs. PTH +  Alend:  \nP < 0.0001; Alend vs. PTH +  Alend: P < 0.0005; males: \n176 CaRTilage 13(4) \nPTH vs. PTH +  Alend: P < 0.0001; Alend vs. PTH + \nAlend: P < 0.0001; Fig. 4A, C, and D). For the other 2 \ncombination protocols (PTH then Alend, PTH wait Alend), \nwe also observed a similar response in both genders; PTH then Alend seems to induce a similar effect as the individual drugs alone have caused (females: Saline vs. PTH then Alend: P < 0.001; PTH vs. PTH then Alend: ns; Alend vs. \nPTH then Alend: ns; males: Saline vs. PTH then Alend: P  < \n0.0001; PTH vs. PTH then Alend: ns; Alend vs. PTH then Alend: ns; Fig. 4A, C, and D ). Last, PTH wait Alend treat-\nment caused an decrease in chondrocyte apoptosis in com-parison with saline in males only (Saline vs. PTH wait Alend: P < 0.0001. Fig. 4D).\nEdU proliferation assay revealed that PTH administra-\ntion alone induced an increased chondrocyte proliferation in comparison with saline or when PTH in combined with Alendronate in female mice (PTH vs. Saline: P  = 0.PTH \nvs. PTH +  Alend: P < 0.001; PTH vs. PTH then Alend: P \n< 0.001; PTH vs. PTH wait Alend: P  < 0.05; Fig. 4B and \nF). However, no statistical difference was observed \nbetween PTH versus Alend or between all other groups in female mice (Fig. 4F). The effects of different treatment in chondrocyte proliferation in males was comparable with females; PTH led to increased proliferation in relation to combined treatment and saline (PTH vs. saline: P  < 0.001; \nPTH vs. Alend: P = 0.001; PTH then Alend: P  < 0.05; \nPTH wait Alend: P < 0.05; Fig. 4B and E ). Although there \nwas no statistical difference between PTH versus Alend, chondrocyte proliferation in the Alend group was signifi-cantly increased in comparison with Saline (Alend vs. saline: P < 0.05; Fig. 4E).\nOur transgene expression revealed that PTH administra-\ntion alone induced an increased Col1a1 cells when com-pared with other experimental groups both in males and females (PTH vs. saline: P < 0.001; PTH vs. Alend: P = \n0.001; PTH then Alend: P < 0.001; PTH wait Alend: P < \n0.05; Fig. 5A, B, and C). In addition, PTH then Alend group \nhad significantly increased Col1a1 when compared with PTH + Alend group (PTH then Alend vs. PTH + Alend:  \nP < 0.0001; Fig. 5A, B, and C).\nThe Col10a1 cells were significantly increased in PTH \nwait Alend group when compared with Saline, PTH and \nFigure 4. Significant increased tUNel in saline and concurrent administration of i-PtH and alendronate.

In addition, \nAlend alone group had significantly increased Col10a1 \ncells when compared with PTH and PTH + Alend group (Alend vs. PTH: P < 0.0001; Alend vs. PTH + Alend:  \nP < 0.05; Fig. 5A, D, and E).\nexpression of Cartilage Degeneration Markers\nAdministration of PTH or Alend alone or in separated \ncombination (PTH then Alend, PTH wait Alend) substantially decreased the expression of MMP13, in both female and male mice in comparison with saline injection (females: Saline vs. PTH: P  < 0.0001; Saline vs. Alend: P \n< 0.0001; Saline vs. PTH the Alend: P  < 0.0001; Saline \nvs. PTH wait Alend: P  < 0.001; males: Saline vs. PTH: P \n< 0.001; Saline vs. Alend: P  < 0.001; Saline vs. PTH then \nAlend: P < 0.0001; Saline vs. PTH wait Alend: P  < 0.05. \nFig. 6A, C, and D ). However, the combination of PTH + \nAlend has eliminated the beneficial effects of the other \ntreatments in both gender groups (females: Saline vs. PTH + Alend: ns; males: Saline vs. PTH +  Alend: ns; Fig. 6C  \nand D).\nFigure 5.

For males, \nthe different combined treatment also did not induce a sig-nificant treatment except for PTH +  Alend (Saline vs. PTH \n+ Alend: P < 0.0001; Saline vs. PTH then Alend: ns; Saline \nvs. PTH wait Alend: ns; Fig. 6E).\nDiscussion\nThe current treatment for TMJ-OA is limited and National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) rec-ommends palliative treatment with analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Partial or total TMJ replacement is the only available alternative treatment for TMJ-OA. Therefore, the development of effective disease modifying treatment for TMJ-OA is needed.\neffects of i-PTH and alendronate on Bone\nWe found that in both male and female mice, I-PTH and Alendronate had no effect on mandibular condylar sub-chondral bone volume when administered individually, but when combined, they acted synergistically to promote sig-nificant increases on bone volume. Effects on bone volume were comparable regardless of the combination, and it made no difference if I-PTH and Alendronate were co-adminis-tered or administered in sequence. I-PTH and Alendronate also acted synergistically to block osteoclast activity (as revealed by TRAP staining) in both males and females. In males, this effect was somewhat less pronounced when Alendronate was administered immediately after I-PTH and significantly less pronounced when Alendronate was \nFigure 6.

Although there was a significant increase in TRAP levels in males, overall, I-PTH and Alendronate had little effect on osteoclast activity by them-selves in either males or females. Together, these results demonstrate strong, synergistic, and anabolic effects of PTH and Alend on mandibular condylar subchondral bone when they are administered in combination or in sequence, but not individually. This signifies that concurrent I-PTH + \nAlendronate administration and Alendronate treatment after \nI-PTH administration significantly reduced the subchondral bone remodeling and increased mandibular condylar sub-chondral bone volume both in males and females. Alendronate has been shown to improve the architecture of subchondral bone and periarticular bone following OA in the knee joint.\n15 The efficacy of anti-resorptive treatments \nfor preventing OA may depend on several systemic and environmental factors, such as the rate of subchondral bone turnover. The current study used young male and female triple transgenic reporter mice, and they have an accelerated subchondral bone remodeling of the TMJ, which is further accentuated by administration of I-PTH,\n10 and Alendronate \nhas been shown to be more effective in a background with high bone turnover.\n15 Increased bone volume in response to \ncombined PTH and Alend paralleled decreased osteoclast activity, raising the possibility that reduced matrix turnover might be responsible for the increased bone volume. One of the hallmark of OA is thickened subchondral bone or sig-nificant loss of subchondral bone. Loss of subchondral bone usually happens after trauma/injury and based on our obser -\nvation, alendronate if given after I-PTH can significantly reduce the loss of subchondral bone.\n15-18\neffects of i-PTH and alendronate on Cartilage \nalone\nPTH is an endocrine regulator of mineral homeostasis spe-\ncifically of calcium and phosphate levels.19,20 It has been \nshown that continuous PTH exposure results in catabolic effects, while intermittent PTH is associated with anabolic effects.\n19,20 I-PTH has been used for the treatment of clini-\ncal osteoporosis.17,21,22 Effects of individual I-PTH and \nAlendronate were consistently anabolic for TMJ cartilage, causing significantly increased cartilage thickness and chondrocyte proliferation, and significantly reduced levels of apoptotic cell death, MMP13, and ADAMTS5. It has been shown that I-PTH has an anabolic effect to the osteo-chondral tissue of TMJ\n10 and knee joint.23,24 Anabolic \neffects of I-PTH and Alendronate were nearly always sig-nificantly more dramatic in males; the only exception was cartilage thickness in response to Alendronate\u2014which was increased in both males and females, but the increase did not reach statistical significance in males. These observa-tions lead us to conclude that overall, female TMJ cartilage is less responsive than male TMJ cartilage to anabolic stim-ulation by I-PTH\n25 or Alendronate, and/or that some aspects \nof female physiology impair the ability of I-PTH or Alendronate to promote anabolic responses.\n25,26\nWe also noted significant changes in the domains of \nexpression of Col1a1 and Col10a1 in response to I-PTH treatment. Specifically, in response to PTH, the domain of Col1a1 expression in the MCC was significantly increased, and that of Col10a1 significantly decreased. Increased Col1a1 expression in MCC is associated with anabolic stimuli such as treatment with BMP2\n27 or mechanical \nloading.28 Thus, the increased Col1a1 expression in mice \ntreated with I-PTH can be unambiguously categorized as an anabolic response, which aligns well with the other anabolic effect that I-PTH exerted on TMJ cartilage, including increased proliferation and cartilage thickness and suppression of apoptotic cell death and MMP13/ADAMTS5 levels. That the reduced Col10a1 expression domain is also an anabolic response to I-PTH is supported by other studies demonstrating reduced Col10a1/collagen type X levels in TMJ cartilage in response to other ana-bolic stimuli, such as genetic FGFR1 deletion, in which decreased collagen type X accompanied increased carti-lage thickness and chondrocyte proliferation, and reduced matrix protease production.\n29\nThe increased Col1a1\u2014and decreased Col10a1\u2014\ndomains in response to I-PTH are not the result of altered collagen turnover, because the fluorescent reporters in our study reflect mRNA expression, and not protein distribu-tion. Rather, the changes in Col1a1 and Col10a1 expres-sion domains in I-PTH-treated TMJ cartilage reflect a shift toward a greater proportion of chondrocytes express-ing Col1a1 relative to Col10a1. This pattern is characteris-tic of TMJ cartilage from young animals as opposed to aged animals,\n30 suggesting I-PTH treatment not only stim-\nulates growth of the MCC, but may also rejuvenate it; this idea is supported by recent studies by us and others show-ing delay of age-related TMJ degeneration in response to I-PTH.\n10,31\neffects of i-PTH and alendronate on Cartilage \nTogether\nCo-administration of I-PTH and Alendornate (PTH + \nAlend) significantly blocked or blunted their individual anabolic effects on chondrocyte proliferation and suppres-sion of apoptosis and MMP13 levels, in both male and female TMJ cartilage.\nNotably, and only in females, co-administration also \nblocked the individual anabolic effects of I-PTH and Alendronate on TMJ cartilage thickening. This result is consistent with our suggestion that some aspects of female physiology impair the anabolic effects of PTH and Alendronate on TMJ cartilage,\n25 and further, raises the \n180 CaRTilage 13(4) \npossibility that this catabolic influence is part of a feedback \nresponse to I-PTH7,32,33 and/or Alendronate stimulation.\nOur observation that TMJ cartilage thickness was \nincreased only in male mice in response to co-administered I-PTH and Alendronate (PTH +  Alend) is at first puzzling, \nas most of the accompanying physiologic measures were catabolic, not anabolic\u2014for example, proliferation and Col1a1 levels were reduced, and MMP13, TUNEL, and Col10a1 levels were no longer suppressed. Moreover, simi-lar changes occurred in female mice, indicating that changes in these measures were not influenced by the sex of the ani-mal. However, we noticed that in males, ADAMTS5 levels continued to be very strongly suppressed in response to co-administered I-PTH and Alendronate\u2014to the same extent as they were in response to I-PTH or Alendronate alone\u2014but this was not the case in females, in which ADAMTS5 levels returned to baseline when I-PTH and Alendronate were co-administered. These results indicate that ADAMTS5 sup-pression is completely blocked by co-administered I-PTH and Alendornate in female TMJ cartilage only. We propose that the increased cartilage thickness in male mice in response to co-administered I-PTH and Alendronate is due to impaired ADAMTS5-mediated matrix turnover\u2014pre-sumably of aggrecan and/or other matrix components nor -\nmally targeted by ADAMTS5, such as hyaluronan or versican.\n34-36 In the future, it will be of interest to examine \nthe relative abundance of aggrecan, hyaluronan, and versi-can in male versus female TMJ cartilage in the presence of PTH and Alend alone and in combination.\nAdministering I-PTH and Alendronate in sequence (first \nPTH, then Alendronate), restored some, but not all, of their individual anabolic effects on MCC, which were otherwise blocked by combined delivery. For example, the ability of I-PTH or Alendronate to suppress TUNEL and MMP13 lev-els, and of I-PTH to increase Col1a1 expression\u2014anabolic effects that were completely blocked when I-PTH and Alendornate were given together\u2014were partially restored when PTH and Alendronate were given in immediate sequence. This is surprising as the difference between administering I-PTH and Alendronate together, versus administering them in immediate sequence, is only a matter of moments. Our interpretation is that the physiology of MCC is exquisitely sensitive to even subtle shifts in the relative amounts of I-PTH and Alendronate in the body. In contrast, the physiology of mandibular condylar bone was relatively insensitive to these shifts, at least as assayed by the measures we examined in this study (bone volume as revealed by uCT and osteoclast number as revealed by TRAP staining), which were virtually the same regardless of I-PTH and Alendronate co-administration, immediate sequential delivery, or sequential delivery with a 7-day wait in between.\nNotably, sequential delivery was unable to restore the \nanabolic effects of individual or combined I-PTH and Alendronate on chondrocyte proliferation or cartilage thick-ness. Chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage thickness are key indicators of anabolic response and suggests the poten-tial clinical benefit of individual or co-administered I-PTH and Alendronate supplementation for cartilage homeostasis.\nInterestingly, the anabolic effect of immediate sequen-\ntial delivery on restoring the ability of I-PTH and Alendronate to suppress TUNEL and MMP13 levels was reversed by waiting 7 days between I-PTH and Alendronate administration, and the resultant increases in TUNEL and MMP13 levels were significantly more dra-matic in females than in males. Similarly, levels of ADAMTS5 and Col10a1 were also significantly increased by the I-PTH-wait-7-day-Alendronate regimen, and these increases were also more dramatic in females than in males. The physiological role of I-PTH as a factor modu-lating the proliferation and differentiation of chondro-cytes has been long identified through parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)\u2013Indian hedgehog (Ihh) feedback loop,\n7,32,33 whereas the role of alendronate on \nchondrocyte turnover is unclear.\nMMP1337 and ADAMTS538,39 are established cartilage \ndegeneration markers,40 and increase in MMP13, \nADAMTS5, and TUNEL positive cells plays an important role in degradation of the cartilage.\n37,39-43 In particular, \nMMP13 plays a central role in degrading collagenase matrix,\n44,45 whereas ADAMTS5 is known to degrade aggre-\ncan.46,47 In our study, we observed significant reduction in \nMMP13 with the administration of I-PTH, Alendronate, and I-PTH and then alendronate. Elevation of MMP13 usu-ally signifies the breakdown of the extracellular matrix and which usually precedes cartilage degeneration.\n10,37,40,48 Our \nfindings of reduction in MMP13 with I-PTH and alendro-nate treatment have been reported previously in knee carti-lage.\n37,40,49 In addition, our immunostaining of ADAMTS5 \n(preoteoglycan degrading enzyme) showed that both I-PTH and alendronate administration alone leads to decreased expression of ADAMTS5.\n38 The results of our immunos-\ntaining are also consistent with increased cartilage thick-ness and chondrocyte proliferation, and decreased degradation of collagen and aggrecan. Collagen and aggre-can are basic structural components of the TMJ cartilage, and their breakdown correlates with the progression of TMJ-OA. Furthermore, we observed significant decrease in TUNEL (apoptosis) positive cells with the administration of I-PTH, alendronate, and I-PTH and then alendronate. Our findings of immunostaining and TUNEL positive cells are in synchrony.\nOur study had several strengths including the triple \ntransgenic reporter male and female mice and in-depth his-tological and micro-CT examination. To our knowledge, this is the first study looking at the effects of alendronate alone and in combination with I-PTH on the TMJ. Several other studies have investigated the role of PTH\n23,41 and \nChen et al. 181\nalendronate on knee joint15; however, knee joint and TMJ \nhave distinct developmental origins35 and are made up of \ndifferent types of cartilage, comprised of unique chondro-\nprogenitor and chondrocyte population and with matrices that differ in molecular composition, structure, and mineral content.\n3,50 In addition, TMJ cartilage is a secondary carti-\nlage (develops after bone formation), whereas knee carti-lage is a primary cartilage (precedes bone formation).\n16,50 \nOur study focused on younger mice to understand the role of I-PTH and alendronate in different permutations and combinations to harness the distinct role of individual and synergistic/antagonistic effects of PTH and alendronate on the osteochondral tissue of TMJ.\nOur future studies will focus on studying the effects of \nI-PTH and alendronate in a acute (artificially induced) and chronic (age-related) TMJ degeneration model and to study the possible mechanistic pathways by which I-PTH and alendronate act synergistically or antagonictically to mod-ify the disease.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization and Methodology: Mara O\u2019Brien, Eliane Dutra, \nPo-Jung Chen, Ke Wang, Sumit Yadav.
