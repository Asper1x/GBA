The present study investigated the effects of  Mg++ supplementation \non preventing CS-induced muscle atrophy in an animal model, which provided experimental data for potential clinical \ntranslation.\nMethods Twelve 24-week-old male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CS methyl-\nprednisolone (MPS) to induce muscle atrophy, with half of the rats also given daily 50\u00a0mg/kg  Mg++ oral supplementation. \nAdditional six rats without LPS + CS treatments were used as normal controls. After treatment for 6\u00a0weeks, serum was \ncollected for  Mg++ quantification, animal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed for tissue composition, \nand the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was collected for muscle functional test and histology including muscle fiber size, \nintramuscular fat infiltration and fiber typing. In\u00a0vitro myotube atrophy model was used to study the in\u00a0vitro effect associated \nwith in\u00a0vivo muscle atrophy.\nResults LPS + CS treatments induced hypomagnesemia while the serum  Mg++ level was in normal range after  Mg++ sup-\nplementation. DXA showed 53.0% lower fat percent and 29.7% higher lean mass in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared \nto LPS + CS group. Muscle functional test showed 22.2% higher specific twitch force and 40.3% higher specific tetanic \nforce in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Histological analysis showed 4.1% higher proportion of \nmuscle fibers area to total area and 63.6% lower intramuscular fat infiltration in EDL sections in LPS + CS + Mg group when \ncompared to LPS + CS group. LPS + CS + Mg group had 33.0% higher area proportion and 29.4% higher cross-sectional \narea (CSA) of type IIb muscle fiber. Myoblast culture results showed that  Mg++ supplementation group had larger myotube \ndiameter. The mRNA expressions of the muscle atrophy marker genes MuRF1 and MAFbx were lower in  Mg++ supplemen-\ntation group both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.\nConclusion The current study demonstrated that  Mg++ supplementation successfully alleviated CS-associated muscle atrophy \nin rats at both functional and morphology levels, indicating a translational potential for patients undergoing CS therapy. This \nstudy provided the evidence for the first time that  Mg++ supplementation could prevent muscle atrophy\u2014an adverse effect \nof CS therapy, currently also adopted for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nKeywords Corticosteroid\u00a0\u00b7 Magnesium\u00a0\u00b7 Muscle atrophy\n * Ling Qin \n lingqin@cuhk.edu.hk\n1 Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory of\u00a0Department \nof\u00a0Orthopaedics and\u00a0Traumatology and\u00a0Innovative \nOrthopaedic Biomaterial and\u00a0Drug Translational Research \nLaboratory, Li Ka Shing Institute of\u00a0Health Sciences, \nThe Chinese University of\u00a0Hong Kong, Rm74026, 5/F, \nClinical Science Building, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, \nHong\u00a0Kong\u00a0SAR, People\u2019s\u00a0Republic\u00a0of\u00a0China2 Centre for\u00a0Regenerative Medicine and\u00a0Health, Hong \nKong Institute of\u00a0Science and\u00a0Innovation, Chinese \nAcademy of\u00a0Sciences Limited, Hong\u00a0Kong\u00a0SAR, \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic\u00a0of\u00a0China\n3 Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and\u00a0Technology \nInstitute (Futian), The Chinese University of\u00a0Hong Kong, \nHong\u00a0Kong\u00a0SAR, People\u2019s\u00a0Republic\u00a0of\u00a0China\n4380 European Journal of Nutrition (2021) 60:4379\u20134392\n1 3\nIntroduction\nPulsed and long-term corticosteroid (CS) were frequently \nindicated in the treatment of infectious and rheumatoid dis-\neases for modifying the disease progression and life-saving, \nsuch as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Sys-\ntemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and severe coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) [1 , 2]. A large clinical trial in \nthe UK demonstrated that treatment with CS reduced one-\nthird of deaths of patients critically ill with COVID-19 [3 ]. \nHowever, the side-effects of CS might include myopathy, \nelectrolyte abnormalities, obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and \nosteonecrosis, etc., that were similar to Cushing\u2019s syndrome \n[4, 5].\nCS-associated muscle atrophy was first described in 1932 \nin Cushing\u2019s syndrome [ 6] with an incidence of 60% in CS-\ntreated patients [7 ]. Recent studies showed increased mus-\ncular consequences in infectious diseases such as SARS and \nCOVID-19 with therapeutic CS [8 , 9]. Evidence showed \nthat CS had a direct effect on increasing muscle protein \ndegradation and inhibiting amino acid transport to muscle \ncells [10, 11]. CS also induced electrolyte abnormalities, \nsuch as lower serum magnesium (Mg) in patients [ 12]. Mg \ndeficiency was associated with the increase of numerous \nclinical risks, including sarcopenia, vascular and metabolic \ndisorders, insulin resistance, alterations in lipid metabolism \n[13], which were just similar to Cushing\u2019s symptoms. There \nwas a vicious circle between Mg deficiency and metabolic \ndiseases, while Mg supplementation benefited the patients \nin alleviating the symptoms [14, 15]. Evidence showed \nthat Mg deficiency was associated with impaired muscle \nfunction [16]. The serum Mg concentration was indepen-\ndently correlated with muscle performance in the elderly \n[17], and Mg supplementation benefited muscle strength \nin humans [18]. Thus, besides direct effects, CS could also \nimpair the skeletal muscle indirectly through CS-induced \nMg deficiency.\nWe hypothesized that  Mg++ supplementation could alle-\nviate CS-induced muscle atrophy. A rat model with CS-\nassociated muscle atrophy symptom was used in this study \n[19]. The serum  Mg++ level, tissue composition, muscle \nfunction and morphology were evaluated to understand the \neffect of  Mg++ supplementation in\u00a0vivo. The direct effects \nof CS and  Mg++ on myoblasts in\u00a0vitro were also investi-\ngated. The in\u00a0vivo mRNA expression of muscle atrophy \nmarker genes MuRF1 and MAFbx were examined. The \nresults of this study demonstrated for the first time that \nthe CS-associated muscle atrophy was alleviated by  Mg++ \nsupplementation.Materials and\u00a0methods\nEthics statement\nAll the experimental protocols were reviewed and \napproved by the Animal Experimental Ethics Commit-\ntee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Ref No. \n17\u2013087-MIS). We followed both the Guide for the Care \nand Use of Laboratory Animal (1996) [ 20] and the \nARRIVE (Animals in research: reporting in\u00a0vivo experi-\nments) guidelines [21].\nExperimental animals and\u00a0study design\nEighteen 24-week-old male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats with \nbody weight of 500  ~ 550\u00a0g were used in this study. \nThey were housed in a standard temperature-controlled \nanimal room (25\u00a0\u00b0C) and received food and water \nad\u00a0libitum.\nAnimals were randomly divided into three groups \n(n = 6). Twelve rats were used to induce CS-associated \nmuscle atrophy with the induction procedure as follows: \non day 1, under general anesthesia with i.p. injection \nof 90\u00a0mg/kg of ketamine and 10\u00a0mg/kg of xylazine, \neach rat was intravenously injected with 0.2\u00a0mg/kg of \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli O111:B4; \nSigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) via tail vein with a \ncontrolled stable speed of injection steadily over 30\u00a0min \nfor each rat to mimic the clinical inflammatory diseases \nto be indicated for CS therapy [ 19]. Clinically, high dose \nMPS (30\u00a0mg/kg) was prescribed to severe sepsis patients \n[22]. The dosage for rats was calculated based on a guide \nfor dose conversion between animals and human [23]. \nLong-term CS therapy was used for the treatment of vari-\nous clinical conditions [24]. To simulate long-term CS \ntherapy on severe infection, on day 2, 3, 4 of the first \nweek, three intraperitoneally injections of high-dose \nCS methylprednisolone (MPS, 100\u00a0mg/kg body weight, \nPfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV) were given, and then \nlow doses of MPS (40\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) were given three times \na week from the second week through week 6. Week 6 \nwas selected as the time point for efficacy assessment \nbased on the previous dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry \n(DXA) results that shorter treatment could not induce \nlower muscle mass in rat [19]. Six rats without LPS + CS \ntreatment were used as normal controls. Saline was used \nas the vehicle control with the same injection procedures \nas LPS and MPS treatments. The LPS + CS-treated rats \n4381 European Journal of Nutrition (2021) 60:4379\u20134392 \n1 3\nwere randomly divided into the  Mg++ supplementation \ngroup (LPS + CS + Mg group) and the LPS + CS group. \nFor the LPS + CS + Mg group, from the first day of \nMPS injection, magnesium sulfate  (MgSO4) dissolved \nin drinking water (providing 50\u00a0mg/kg/day  Mg++) was \norally administrated daily to rats with oral gavage [25]. \nDrinking water was administrated daily to the normal \ngroup and LPS + CS group with oral gavage. The body \nweight of the rats was monitored twice a week. At the \nend of week 6, the rats were euthanized by intravenous \ninjection of pentobarbital, and samples were collected for \nfurther analysis (Fig.\u00a0 1).\nAnimal dual\u2011energy X\u2011ray absorptiometry (DXA)\nFor determination of the tissue composition of lean weight \nand fat percent, at week 6 before euthanasia, rats were \nscanned and analyzed using UltraFocus\u2122 Digital Radi -\nography System (Faxitron Bioptics, LLC, USA) with \u00d7 1.0 \nmagnification at the lower body. Limited by the animal DXA \nmachine, a whole-body scan could only be carried out on \nmice in our setting. The region of interest (ROI) was circled \nmanually as an oval shape with a 0.8\u20131.0\u00a0  cm2 size adjacent \nto the lateral tibia but not including any bone tissue. The \nROI was chosen at the low limb excluded the bone region \nbecause the fat percent in normal rat was as low as 1.5% in this ROI to study the tissue composition alterations in the \nLPS + CS-treated groups [19].\nEx vivo muscle functional test\nAt week 6 before euthanasia and under general anesthesia, \nthe extensor digitorum longus (EDL) of the left hind limb \nwas dissected. CS was catabolic for fast-twitch muscles \n(e.g., EDL) while slow-twitch muscles (e.g., soleus) were \nmore resistant to CS [26], the EDL was, therefore, chosen \nfor analysis in the present study. For stabilization, the freshly \nisolated muscle was incubated in the Krebs solution with \nbubbled gas (95%  O2 and 5%  CO2) for 15\u00a0min. After stabili-\nzation, the muscle function was investigated with the dual-\nmode muscle lever arm system (305C-LR, Aurora Scientific \nInc., Newmarket, Canada) [27, 28]. For the warm-up, two \ntetanic contractions (10 pulses with the Pulse Frequency \n200\u00a0Hz and Pulse Width 0.2\u00a0ms) with a 3-min rest interval \nwere induced before the functional test. Optimal length (L0) \nwas measured from a serial isometric twitch (one pulse with \n0.2\u00a0ms width) with 30-s intervals with increasing muscle \nlength until maximal force. Under L0, the Twitch force (F0) \nwas the max force generated by a single stimulus (one pulse \nwith 0.2\u00a0ms width). Under L0, the Tetanic force (Ft) was the \nmax force generated by tetanic contractions (80 pulses and \nthe Pulse Frequency: 200\u00a0Hz, Pulse Width 0.2\u00a0ms). 30-s \nFig. 1  Animal treatment protocols. Rats were treated with one injec-\ntion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for simulating inflammation dis-\neases and subsequent injections of CS methylprednisolone (MPS) for disease treatment for 6\u00a0 weeks. Daily oral supplementation of  Mg++ \nwas performed from the first day of MPS injection for 6\u00a0weeks before \nsample collection\n4382 European Journal of Nutrition (2021) 60:4379\u20134392\n1 3\nrest was needed after each twitch stimulation, and 3-min \nrest was needed after each tetanic stimulation. The muscle \nmass was measured immediately after the functional test. \nThe Dynamic Muscle Control system (DMC v5.4; Aurora \nScientific, Inc.) was used to record muscle functional test \nresults, and the Dynamic Muscle Analysis system (DMA \nv3.2; Aurora Scientific, Inc.) was used for the analysis of \nthe functional test results.\nThe physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was cal-\nculated by dividing the muscle mass (MM) with the mus -\ncle optimal length (L0) and the density (D ) of mammalian \nskeletal muscle (1.06\u00a0mg/mm3). Normalized by PCSA, the \nspecific twitch force  (SF0) and specific tetanic force  (SFt) \nwere obtained as the following equations [27]:\nHistological and\u00a0immunofluorescence analyses\nAt week 6 before euthanasia, the EDL of the right hind \nlimb was dissected under general anesthesia, and then fro-\nzen immediately in liquid nitrogen-chilled 2-methylbutane \nin optimal length for 20\u00a0s. The frozen muscles were stored \nat \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C, then transverse sectioned with 8\u00a0\u03bcm thickness \nusing a cryostat (Cryocut 1800, Leica) at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C and \nstored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C for further analysis. After cryosection, \nthe other half of EDL was stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C for mRNA \nquantification.\nThe cryosections were thawed at room temperature, fixed \nin 10% buffered formalin for 10\u00a0min, and then stained with \nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Oil Red O for histologi-\ncal evaluations of muscle fiber and intramuscular fat infil-\ntration. Briefly, for H&E staining, the fixed cryosections \nwere stained with hematoxylin for 1\u00a0min, differentiated \nand blued and then stained with eosin for 2\u00a0min. For Oil \nRed O staining, the fixed cryosections were stained with \n0.5% Oil Red O working solution in isopropanol for 15\u00a0min \nand counterstained with hematoxylin for 30\u00a0s after washed \nwith distilled water.

The outline of the indi-\nvidual fibers was traced, and the area was expressed in \u03bcm2. \nFor analyzing intramuscular fat infiltration, the proportion \nof Oil Red O-stained area to total area was determined on \nOil Red O-stained images with Image J (ImageJ 1.51j8, \nNational Institutes of Health, USA). The area of red stain-\ning was automatically differentiated and calculated by the \ndefault program.\nFor muscle fiber typing, immunofluorescence (IF) \nstaining of myosin heavy chain (MHC) was performed \nwith a primary antibody cocktail including antibodies \nagainst MHC I (BA\u2212F8), MHC IIa (SC\u221271), and MHC \nIIb (BF\u2212F3) (DSHB, IA, USA), and the secondary anti-\nbody cocktail including Alexa Fluor 350\u00a0IgG2b, Alexa \nFluor 488\u00a0IgG1, and Alexa Fluor 555\u00a0IgM (Invitrogen, \nCA, USA). The concentrations of both cocktails were \n4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL[29]. After the image acquisition with a micro-\nscopic imaging system (Leica DM6000B, Leica Micro-\nsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), areas of MHC I (blue), MHC \nIIa (green), MHC IIb (red) were quantified with Image J \n(ImageJ 1.51j8, National Institutes of Health, USA). Data \nwere expressed with the area proportion and the CSA of \nthe different fiber types.\nSerum  Mg++\nSerum was collected at week 6 and stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C. Col-\nourimetric test was performed to determine the serum  Mg++ \nlevel using Mg  LiquiColor\u00ae kit (Stanbio Laboratory, Texas, \nUSA).\nCell culture\nThe mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 (ATCC, Rockville, \nMD, USA) was grown in the growth medium, which was \nDMEM containing 10% FBS in a 5%  CO2 humidified \natmosphere at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. For myoblast differentiation, the \ngrowth medium in C2C12 myoblast cultures was replaced \nby the differentiation medium, which was DMEM con-\ntaining 2% horse serum (HS) in a 5%  CO2 humidified \natmosphere at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The medium was changed every \nday. After 2\u00a0days of incubation with differentiation \nmedium, cells were treated with CS (1\u00a0\u00b5M MPS) with \nor without 10\u00a0 mM magnesium chloride for 2\u00a0 days. \nThe control group was treated with solvent only. After \n2\u00a0days of MPS or solvent treatment, the myotube diam-\neter was measured and the total mRNA was extracted for \nquantification.\n4383 European Journal of Nutrition (2021) 60:4379\u20134392 \n1 3\nMeasurement of\u00a0myotube diameter\nMyotube cultures were photographed under a phase-\ncontrast microscope at \u00d7 100 magnification on day 4.

There \nwas no significant difference for the time to max-force or \nthe half-relaxation time among groups (p  > 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 4F, \nG). Then we tested the muscle strength, contractibility, and \nrelaxation parameters under tetanic stimulation (Fig.\u00a0 4H). \nThe results showed that the specific tetanic force in the \nLPS + CS group was 40.3% lower than that in the normal group ( p < 0.001, Fig.\u00a0 4I), the time to max-force in the \nLPS + CS group was 17.9% shorter than that in the normal \ngroup (p  < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 4J), whereas  Mg++ treatment group \nshowed higher specific tetanic force (42.0%) and longer \ntime to max tetanic force (18.9%) when compared to the \nLPS + CS group (p  < 0.05 for both, Fig.\u00a0 4I, J). The half-\nrelaxation time for the LPS + CS group was 27.5% longer \ncompared to that in the normal group (p  < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 4K), \nbut  Mg++ treatment group had 15.8% shorter half-relaxation \ntime (p  < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 4K).\nMg++ protects muscle morphology \nin\u00a0LPS + CS\u2011treated rats\nHistology and histomorphometry analysis were performed \non the transverse sectioned EDL 6\u00a0weeks after CS treat-\nment. Quantification results on the H&E-stained images \nshowed that the proportion of muscle fiber area to total \narea of the LPS + CS group was 6.0% lower than normal \n(p < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 5A, D), and that  Mg++ supplementation \ngroup had 4.1% greater the proportion of muscle fiber \narea to total area when compared to the LPS + CS group \n(p < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 5A, D). There was no significant difference \nin muscle fiber CSA among groups (p  > 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 5E). Oil \nRed O staining showed that LPS + CS treatment for 6\u00a0weeks \ninduced fat infiltration between muscle fibers (Fig.\u00a0 5B). \nQuantification of Oil Red O-stained images showed that \nthe proportion of stained areas in LPS + CS group was 12.8-\nfold higher than normal (p  < 0.001, Fig.\u00a0 5F), but  Mg++ sup-\nplementation group had 63.6% lower the proportion of the \nstained area when compared to LPS + CS group (p  < 0.001, \nFig.\u00a05F). Myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunofluorescence \nstaining results showed that the percentage area of type \nIIb in the LPS  + CS group was 35.6% lower than normal \n(p < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 5C, G), but that of type IIa was 71.9% higher \nthan normal (p  < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 5C, G). LPS + CS + Mg group \nshowed 33.0% higher percentage of type IIb fibers than the \nLPS + CS group (p  < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 5C, G). The type IIb muscle \nfiber CSA of the LPS + CS group was 28.9% lower than nor -\nmal (p  < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 5C, H). LPS + CS + Mg group showed \n29.4% higher type IIb muscle fiber CSA than the LPS + CS \ngroup (p  < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 5C, H). No significant differences were \ndetected for the type I or type IIa muscle fiber CSA among \ngroups (p  > 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 5C, H).\nMg++ inhibits C2C12 myotube atrophy induced \nby\u00a0CS in\u00a0vitro\nWe investigated the  Mg++ effect on myotube atrophy induced \nby CS using the C2C12 myoblast cell line (Fig.\u00a0 6A). The dif-\nferentiation of C2C12-myoblast to myotube was observed Fig. 3  Mg++ regulates tissue composition in CS-treated rats.

Been treated with 2% \nHS for 4\u00a0days, the fusion of cells and the formation of elon-\ngated myotubes were observed (Fig.\u00a0 6B). The qPCR analysis \ndetected the expression of myogenic and atrophic markers \nin cultured myoblast after 4\u00a0days of their differentiation. \nResults showed that after 2\u00a0days of CS treatment during the \ndifferentiation from myoblast to myotube, the diameter of \nthe C2C12 myotubes was smaller than that of control group \n(p < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 6C).  Mg++ treatment group had significantly \nlarger diameter of the C2C12 myotubes when compared to \nthe CS group (p  < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 6C). For the myoblast differ -\nentiation marker genes MyoD, MyoG, Myf-5, and Myf-6, \nthere was no significant difference in their mRNA expres -\nsion among groups (p  > 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 6D\u2013G). For the genes \nregulating protein degradation, the Foxo3 mRNA expres-\nsion was not significantly affected by CS or  Mg++ treatment \n(p > 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 6H), while the MuRF1 (official name Trim63) \nand MAFbx (official gene name Fbxo32) mRNA expres-\nsions were both significantly greater in CS treatment group \n(p < 0.01 for both, Fig.\u00a0 6I, J).  Mg++ treatment group had \nsignificantly lower expressions of the MuRF1 and MAFbx \nmRNA compared to the CS group (p  < 0.01 for both, Fig.\u00a0 6I, \nJ).\nMg++ inhibits LPS + CS\u2011induced gene expression \nassociated with\u00a0muscle atrophy in\u00a0vivo\nWe quantified the mRNA levels of MuRF1 and MAFbx \nin EDL in\u00a0vivo. Results showed that LPS + CS group \nhad 41.3% greater MuRF1 (p  < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 7A) and 32.1% \ngreater MAFbx (p  < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 7B) mRNA expressions \nin EDL of rats.  Mg++ supplementation group had 39.6% \nlower MuRF1 and 46.7% lower MAFbx mRNA expres-\nsions when compared to the CS group (p  < 0.01 for both, \nFig.\u00a0 7A, B).\nDiscussion\nThe present study demonstrated that supplementation \nof  Mg++ alleviated CS-associated muscle atrophy in \nrats, primarily evidenced by the muscle function tests \nwhere LPS + CS-induced lower specific twitch force and \nthe specific tetanic force, while  Mg++ supplementation \nresulted in greater specific twitch force and the specific \ntetanic force than those LPS + CS-treated animals. This \nmight suggest that  Mg++ supplementation could become \na cost-effective prevention strategy for CS-associated \nmuscle atrophy. In fact, as CS-associated musculoskel-\netal disorders have significant implications in our clinics, recent efforts have been made to develop relevant preven-\ntion and treatments, including anti-adipogenic and mus-\ncle tonifying herbs for the prevention of CS-associated \nosteonecrosis [30\u2013 32].\nMg++ is the fourth abundant cation in the body and \nis the second abundant within the cell.  Mg++ is a co-\nfactor for more than 300 cellular enzymes involving in \nenergy production and protein and nucleic acid synthe-\nsis [33]. CS therapy was reported to be associated with \nhypomagnesemia, i.e., if the serum  Mg++ concentration \nwas below the normal range [34]. The causes of  Mg++ \ndeficiency in CS-treated patients were multi-factorial, \nincluding the primary disease itself, decreased  Mg++ \nabsorption, and increased urinary excretion of  Mg++ [12, \n34]. Our data suggested that CS treatment induced Mg \ndeficiency in the current rat experimental model, and that \n Mg++ supplementation maintained or increased the serum \n Mg++ level back to normal range. The study, therefore, \nrevealed the beneficial effect of simple  Mg++ supplemen-\ntation in the prevention of metabolic disorder associated \nwith CS therapy.\nCS-induced muscle atrophy in this rat model, as evi-\ndenced by the lower muscle mass measured by DXA, \ndecreased weighting of EDL and lower optimal length \nof EDL confirmed by muscle functional test. The mus-\ncle functional results consistently demonstrated the CS-\ninduced muscle weakness including a reduction in the \nspecific twitch force and the specific tetanic force, which \nwere consistent with previous studies and clinical situa-\ntions [35\u2013 37]. In the LPS + CS group, the time to peak \ntetanic force was shorter and the half relaxation time was \nlonger compared to those in the normal control group, also \nindicating that muscle weakness was induced by LPS + CS \ntreatment.  Mg++ supplementation elevated muscle mass \nshown by DXA measurements, improved strength muscle \nfunction in the specific twitch force and the specific tetanic \nforce, held the time to peak tetanic force and the half relax-\nation time, suggesting the beneficial effect of  Mg++ sup-\nplementation on attenuating CS-associated muscle atrophy \nand weakness.\nFor the relationship between  Mg++ and lipid metabo-\nlism, our histological results showed that  Mg++ supple-\nmentation significantly lowered the intramuscular fat infil-\ntration induced by LPS + CS treatment, and DXA results \nshowed that  Mg++ supplementation significantly lowered \nthe fat percent in the lower body. Correspondingly, the \nprevious study showed that  Mg++ supplementation signifi-\ncantly decreased the bone marrow fat area fraction in the \nsame CS-treated rat model [ 25]. In\u00a0vitro study suggested \nthat  Mg++ did not affect pre-adipocyte differentiation [38], \nwhich suggested that  Mg++ indirectly decreased the fat \n4388 European Journal of Nutrition (2021) 60:4379\u20134392\n1 3\n\n4389 European Journal of Nutrition (2021) 60:4379\u20134392 \n1 3\naccumulation in muscle and bone marrow by regulating \nsystemic lipid metabolism. Clinical studies showed that \n Mg++ intake was negatively associated with the incidence \nof metabolic syndrome, i.e., there were inverse relations \nbetween  Mg++ intake and fasting glucose level, waist cir -\ncumference, and blood triglycerides [39, 40].  Mg++ could \nmodulate blood lipids as dietary  Mg++ contributed to the \nreduction of total serum cholesterol, low-density lipopro-\ntein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride [41]. It was dem-\nonstrated that serum lipid level was positively associated \nwith muscle adiposity [42 ] and bone marrow fat [ 43]. Thus, \nthe role of  Mg++ supplementation in intramuscular fat \naccumulation could be secondary to the effect on systemic \nlipid metabolism.\nFor the muscle fiber typing, the results of the cur -\nrent study demonstrated that CS treatment resulted in \nlower proportion of type IIb fiber area to total area and \nlower type IIb CSA. Although CS was reported to had \npathologic changes to all types of muscle fibers [44], the \nprevious study also demonstrated that the slow-twitch \nmuscles were more resistant to CS [26], which supported \nthe relevant finding of the current study. Similarly, the \ndecline in muscle mass in the elderly was mainly due to \nthe reduction in type II but not type I muscle fiber CSA [45]. However, the LPS + CS group had higher proportion \nof type IIa fiber area to total area yet with no difference \non type IIa CSA. The higher proportion area of type IIa \nmight be compensatory to the lower proportion area of \ntype IIb.  Mg++ supplementation significantly elevated the \nproportion of type IIb fiber area to total area and type IIb \nCSA when compared to the LPS + CS group, suggesting \nits protecting effect on muscle fiber IIb atrophy associ-\nated with CS treatment.\nMuscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy \nF-box (MAFbx) are markers of muscle atrophy. Report \nshowed that they were muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase \nthat transcriptionally increased under muscle atrophy con-\nditions [46]. Our in\u00a0vitro study showed that CS group had \nlower diameter of the myotubes and greater MuRF1 and \nMAFbx expression, evidence that CS induced muscle atro-\nphy by directly inducing muscle protein degradation. For \nthe degradation of intact myofibrillar proteins, they were \ndisassembled and removed from the myofibril by the cal-\ncium-dependent calpain system first and then degraded by \nthe proteasome [ 47].  Mg++ could act as a calcium antago -\nnist to block the calcium-activated protein degradation [48]. \nThe in\u00a0vitro study indicated that  Mg++ supplementation \nreversed the CS-induced lower diameter of the myotubes \nand activated MuRF1 and MAFbx expression, thus provid-\ning evidence that  Mg++ protected muscle from atrophy by \ninhibiting muscle protein degradation. The in\u00a0vivo MuRF1 \nand MAFbx expression were corresponding with the in\u00a0vitro \nstudy.\nIn conclusion,  Mg++ supplementation promoted the ana -\nbolic effect on muscle function and morphology by inhibiting \nfat accumulation and muscle fiber protein degradation. The \npresent study demonstrated for the first time that  Mg++ sup-\nplementation attenuated the adverse effect of CS treatment on \nmuscle atrophy in a rat model. Our preclinical study provided \na scientific foundation for facilitating the supplementation of \n Mg++ as a potential clinical application for patients indicated \nfor CS therapy.Fig. 5  Mg++ protects muscle morphology.
