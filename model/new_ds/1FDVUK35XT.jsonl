In the CG, this neoformation was restrictedto the edges with the deposition of loose co nnective tissue with reduced thickness.

Researchers in this area have\napplied the principles of biological and health sciences,chemistry, physics, and engineering to developing and im-\nproving regenerative techniques and biomaterials capable of\nrestoring or improving the function and aesthetics of com-promised tissues and organs.\n1\u20134\nTo de \ufb01ne the applicability of these biomaterials, they shall\npresent physical-chemical, biological, and morphological prop-erties similar and compatible with living tissues to act as three-\ndimensional (3D) scaffolds assisting tissue regeneration or\nworking as suitable replacements for damaged or lost tissuesand organs. Among the various biomaterials currentlyavailable,\ncalcium phosphate bioceramics (CaP) represent a widely\nresearched and used class in bone regenerative techniques.\n1\nAmong these materials, synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA) has\nstood out in recent decades due to its biocompatibility, similar-\nity with biological apatite, bioactivity, osteoconductivity, non-immunogenicity, and enabling cellular events observed during\ntissue regeneration, such as angiogenesis and osteogenesis.\n1\u20134\nHowever, this ceramic presents slow biodegradation and bio-\nresorption rates after in vivo implantation, asynchronous to the\nbone regeneration mechanism.1\u20134Furthermore, it is a rigid and\nbrittle material, which can remain in the implantation site formonths and even years, depending on the synthesis and\nprocessing method.4,5\nGiven this, one of the main objectives of researchers in this\narea has been to improve the properties of synthetic HA and\nmodify the characteristics of this material to enhance the\ntissue response after in vivo implantation. Among the different\nmethods available to carry out these modi \ufb01cations, HA-hex-\nagonal-structure isomorphic substitutions have shown satis-factory results\n3,6due to the effects on the physical properties\nof the material, observed by changes in network parameters,\ncrystalline structure, morphology, solubility, and thermalstability compared to unsubstituted HA.\n7\nIn these cases, other metals, such as zinc (Zn), strontium\n(Sr),\ufb02uorine (F), manganese (Mn), and magnesium (Mg), can\nreplace calcium (Ca).3,4,6Magnesium has attracted great\nscienti \ufb01c interest, considering that, among other properties,\nit participates in the homeostasis of bone tissue and, togetherwith other minerals, is fundamental to the mechanism of\nbone regeneration, stimulating bone formation, through the\nactivation of osteoblasts and inhibiting resorption, throughaction on osteoclasts.\n8\u201311\nDespite these possibilities, the physicochemical proper-\nties, biological behavior, and regenerative capacity of CaPsubstituted with Mg still require further studies to ensure\nthe effectiveness of the techniques used during the synthesis\nand processing of these biomaterials. Therefore, this studyevaluated the repair of non-critical bone defects after\nimplantation of Mg-substituted HA microspheres in the\nrats \u2019calvaria.Conclusion The biomaterials studied showed biocompatibility, osteoconductivity,\nand bioactivity. The Mg concentration in the substituted HA did not stimulate moresigni \ufb01cant bone formation than HA without this ion.\nResumo Objetivo O presente estudo teve como objetivo fazer uma an\u00e1lise histomorfom\u00e9trica\ndo reparo de um defeito \u00f3sseo n\u00e3o cr\u00edtico ap\u00f3s a implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de microesferas dehidroxiapatita (HA) com substitui\u00e7\u00e3o por magn\u00e9sio (Mg).M\u00e9todos Trinta ratos foram distribu\u00eddos em 3 grupos experimentais, avaliados aos 15\ne 45 dias ap\u00f3s a cirurgia: GHA (defeito \u00f3sseo preenchido com microesferas de HA);GHAMg (defeito \u00f3sseo preenchido com microesferas de HA com substitui\u00e7\u00e3o por 1 mol% de Mg) e GC (defeito \u00f3sseo sem implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de biomateriais).Resultados Aos 15 dias, evidenciou-se que os biomateriais preencheram toda a\nextens\u00e3o do defeito, com neoforma\u00e7\u00e3o de matriz osteoide de permeio \u00e0s microesferas.\nNo GC, essa neoforma\u00e7\u00e3o \ufb01cou restrita \u00e0s bordas, com deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de tecido conjuntivo\nfrouxo de espessura reduzida.

The Author(s).520\n\nMaterials and Methods\nBiomaterials\nThe biomaterials evaluated in this study have been synthe-\nsized, processed, and sterilized in the Biomaterials Labora-tory (LABIOMAT, in the Portuguese acronym) of the Brazilian\nCenter for Physical Research (Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas\nF\u00edsicas, CBPF). The synthesis, processing, and characteriza-tion are described in Santos et al.\n4\nSurgical Procedures\nThis study was performed in the bioterium of Universidade\nEstadual de Feira de Santana (UEFS) after approval by the Ethics\nCommittee on Animal Use (CEUA, in the Portuguese acronym)of Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica, protocol\n02/2013. Thirty adults male Wistar rats, with body weight\nbetween 350 and 400g, were randomly distributed to form 3experimental groups, with 5 animals each: HAG (defect \ufb01lled\nwith HA microspheres group); HAMgG (bone defect \ufb01lled with\nMgHA microspheres group), CG \u2013control group (bone defect\nwithout biomaterial), evaluated 15 and 45 days after surgery.\nThe surgical technique used was the same as described by\nMiguel et al.\n12and illustrated by Santos et al.2However, it is\nworth highlighting that in these studies, the bone defect\nwas approximately 8.0 mm in diameter, while in this study, it\nwas about 5.0 mm13(\u25baFig. 1 ).\nHistological Processing and Histomorphological\nAnalysis\nAt the biological points of 15 and 45 days, the animals have\nbeen euthanized with a lethal ketamine and xylazine dose.\nThen, the upper portion of the calvaria was removed, the softtissues were discarded, and the specimens were \ufb01xed in 4%\nbuffered formaldehyde for 7 days. After this step, they were\ndecalci \ufb01ed in 5% nitric acid for 2 hours, embedded in paraf-\n\ufb01n, and cut into 5.0-\u00b5m thick slices. The histological sectionsobtained were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and\nsubsequently examined by standard light microscopy(DM1000 \u2013Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for histo-\nmorphological and morphometric analysis. A digital camera\n(DFC 310 FX \u2013Leica Camera AG, Wetzlar, Germany) coupled\nto a standard light microscope (DM1000 \u2013Leica) and the\nsoftware QWin 3.1 (Leica) measured the area of the newly\nformed mineralized matrix in the 3 experimental groups.Subsequently, statistical analysis was carried out based on\nthe mean and standard deviation to obtain the p-value, with\na signi \ufb01cance level of 5% ( p<0.05), using the analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA).\nResults\nHistomorphological Analysis\nAt 15 days, in the HAG, neoformation of an osteoid matrixwas observed associated with the bone edges and surround-\ning some microspheres, which were predominantly orga-\nnized in a monolayer and occupied the entire extension ofthe bone defect, maintaining the thickness proportional to\nthe edges (\n\u25baFig. 2A ). Active osteocytes and osteoblasts were\nobserved associated with this matrix. The formation ofconnective tissue and mild chronic in \ufb02ammation with\nmononuclear in \ufb02ammatory in \ufb01ltrate and multinucleated\ngiant cells, mainly around the microspheres, was notedbetween the mineralized areas and the microspheres\n(\n\u25baFig. 2B ).\nAt the biological point of 45 days, the microspheres in the\nHAG were mainly distributed in multilayers. The newly\nformed osteoid matrix was more evident than at 15 days\nand\ufb01lled, on average, 4/5 of the bone defect in a centripetal\ndirection, surrounded by the biomaterial ( \u25baFig. 2C ). The\nmicrospheres near the edges were surrounded by the newly\nFig. 1 Surgical steps for creating a non-critical bone defect.

The Author(s).521\n\nformed osteoid matrix, with many active osteoblasts, osteo-\ncytes, and some concentric lamellae ( \u25baFig. 2D ). In the\nresidual area, the formation of connective tissue with a\ndenser appearance than the previous biological point wasnoted, with the presence of blood vessels and a mild chronic\ngranulomatous in \ufb02ammatory response.\nIn the HAMgG, at 15 days, with the biomaterials, neo-\nformation of the osteoid matrix was noted in a centripetal\ndirection, more evident in the peripheral region of the defect\n(\n\u25baFig. 3A ). Like HA, the biomaterials \ufb01lled the entire bone\ndefect, with a thickness proportional to the edges, and\narranged in a monolayer. Active osteoblasts and numerous\nosteocytes were observed in association with the osteoid\nmatrix. The remaining areas were \ufb01lled with loose connec-\ntive tissue full of blood vessels ( \u25baFig. 3B ) and chronic\ngranulomatous in \ufb02ammatory in \ufb01ltrate of moderate appear-\nance, mainly surrounding the microspheres.At the biological point of 45 days, in the HAMgG, the new\nbone formation permeated by the microspheres extendedcentripetally and con \ufb02uently, \ufb01lling approximately 2/3 of the\nlinear extension of the defect (\n\u25baFig. 3C ). Furthermore, it was\nnoted that the microspheres located close to the edges weresurrounded by osteoid neoformation rich in osteocytes. In\nthe residual area, there was a new formation of connective\ntissue, more organized than at 15 days, and a large number ofblood capillaries (\n\u25baFig. 3D ).\nThe CG, at 15 days, displayed bone neoformation with a\nreactional appearance associated with the edges, presentingactive osteoblasts and osteocytes. The remaining area\nshowed deposition of loose connective tissue, with reduced\nthickness, abundant in spindle cells and blood vessels(\n\u25baFig. 4A ). At 45 days, new bone formation extended beyond\nthe edge in a centripetal direction, more evidently than at\n15 days ( \u25baFig. 4B ). The chronic in \ufb02ammation observed was\ndiscreet and scarce. Tissue repair was completed with the\nformation of connective tissue in the region and no\nmineralization.\nHistomorphometric Analysis\nThe histomorphometric study displayed no statistically sig-ni\ufb01cant differences among the three groups evaluated at\n15 days when analyzing the newly formed osteoid matrix\narea. At the biological point of 45 days, statistical signi \ufb01cance\nwas noted when comparing the HAMgG and HAG with the\nCG, with the latter group having a higher average of newly\nformed osteoid matrix (\n\u25baTable 1 ).\nDiscussion\nExperimental models in vivo have been referenced for many\ndecades in different types of studies in various knowledge\nareas. To evaluate biomaterials designed for bone regeneration,\nthese models must present anatomical and physiological char-\nacteristics that enable an understanding of natural phenomenato determine the osteogenic potential of the materials investi-\ngated.

The Author(s).522\n\nbone defect created in the calvaria of a rat stands out, which\npresents easy access and surgical manipulation, low cost, goodpredictability, and reproducibility.\n14Therefore, this study eval-\nuated the repair of non-critical bone defects after implantation\nof HA microspheres substituted with Mg.\nThe surgical procedureto create this defect promoted tissue\ndamage and, consequently, vascular rupture that resulted in\nblood leakage and clot formation, followed by release ofcytokines that triggered an in \ufb02ammatory response. This in-\n\ufb02ammation, chronic granulomatous, discrete, and regressive\nthroughout the study, agreed with what occurs when abiomaterial is implanted in vivo .\n15,16These \ufb01ndings are in\nline with what was observed by Santos et al .,2Santos et al.,4\nMiguel et al .,12Daltro et al.,13Almeida et al.17and Ribeiro\net al.18These authors evaluated different types of biomaterials\nfor bone regeneration, in rat calvaria, and described the same\ntissue response.\nDuring the physiological events that occur in bone regen-\neration, besides the release of cytokines and chemical medi-\nators, there is the secretion of growth, cellular differentiation,and angiogenic factors, which stimulate the formation of\nconnective tissue rich in new blood vessels, with consequent\ndevelopment of granulation tissue, as well as deposition of the\nosteoid matrix, which subsequently becomes mineralized. At\nall biological points, such histomorphological characteristicswere observed in the three groups evaluated in our study. At\n45 days, in the CG, the neoformation of mineralized tissue was\napproximately 60%. However, in HAG and HAMgG this per-centage was 25 and 20%, respectively. This difference in bone\nneoformation in the two groups with biomaterial implanta-\ntion, as compared to the CG, derives from the presence ofmicrospheres in the bone defect since these were sintered and,\nconsequently, not reabsorbed due to the sintering of the\nmaterial \u2013a procedurethat promotes changes in the HA crystal\nlattice with crystal fusion.\n19Thus, in HAG and HAMgG, the\nmicrospheres occupied a large part of the sectional area of the\ndefect and, thus, formed a three-dimensional frameworkthroughout the linear extension and height of the bone defect.\nIt is worth highlighting that although some authors\nsuggest and defend some methodologies as standard, thereis still no consensus in the literature on which bone defect\nexact diameter shall be considered non-critical or critical. A\n\u201ccritical \u201dbone defect has been de \ufb01ned as a bone defect that\ndoes not regenerate throughout the life of the animal\n20or of\nthe study.21In these cases, the repair is completed by\n\ufb01brosis, and new bone formation is restricted to theedges.4,12,17,18This situation was not observed in the present\nstudy, in which new mineralized tissue formed centripetallyalong the biological points, with regeneration of almost the\nentire defect area in the CG at 45 days. These \ufb01ndings\ncontrast with the results obtained by authors who classifythis 5.0-mm bone defect as critical.\n22\u201324\nConcerning bone regeneration, a 3D scaffold is essential for\nthe cellular and vascular events observed during this mecha-nism. Therefore, ceramic biomaterials have been widely stud-\nied for this purpose in different forms of presentation and\ncomposition. Scienti \ufb01c and technological advances experi-\nenced in recent decades have increasingly enabled the devel-\nopment of materials with biomimetic physicochemical\ncharacteristics to stimulate new bone formation. Among thesematerials, HA has been extensively researched due to its\nbiocompatibility, similarity with natural components of the\nmineral phase of bone tissue, osteoconductivity, bioactivity,\n1,3\nand lack of toxicity and immunogenicity. Our study observed\nsuch characteristics in the two groups in which biomaterials\nwere implanted, in the three biological points, which allowedthe formation of an osteoid matrix and connective tissue\nbetween and surrounding the microspheres.\nThe HA hexagonal structure performs ionic exchanges at\nthe Ca\n2\u00feand HPO 43/C0sites with elements or functional\ngroups that are naturally part of the bone composition topromote changes in crystallinity, solubility, biodegradation,\nand, consequently, in biological properties of the biomaterial\nafter in vivo implantation.\n4,25,26Mg stands out, playing a\ncritical role in bone metabolism and growth: the de \ufb01ciency\nof this element inhibits the osteoblasts \u2019activity, favoring the\nosteoclasts \u2019survival and performance.27,28Furthermore, the\npresence of Mg contributes to biomineralization, mainly in\nthe initial phase of osteogenesis: it increases the kinetics of\nHA nucleation, delays its crystallization, and can interferewith qualitative changes in the bone matrix.\n29This is proba-\nbly why the average bone formation at 15 days was higher in\nHAMgG compared to HAG, however, without statisticallysigni\ufb01cant differences. Despite this, this pattern did not\nrepeat after 45 days, and the average osteoid matrix forma-\ntion was similar between these groups.\nMg also has an essential effect on promoting angiogenesis,\nstimulating endothelial cells, and the production of vascular\ngrowth factors,\n30which may justify the presence of more\nevident blood vessels in HAMgG than in the other groups\nthroughout the study. Furthermore, incorporating this metal\ninto the HA structure promoted a slight decrease in theTable 1 Percentage of the newly formed mineralized area in relation to the total area of the defect at the 15- and 45-days biological\npoints, in the 3 experimental groups\nGroup\nPeriodHAMgG HAG CG P-value\n(between-group)Comparison\nHAMgG x HAGComparison of CG with\nHAMgG and HAG\n15 days 25% (/C629) 12% ( /C67) 20% ( /C638) p\u00bc0.58 NS p\u00bc0.55 NS HAMgG: p\u00bc0.89 NS\nHAG: p\u00bc0.82 NS\n45 days 20% (/C613) 25% ( /C611) 61% ( /C621) p\u00bc0.01 S p\u00bc0.92 NS HAMgG: p\u00bc0.01 S\nHAG: p\u00bc0.02 S\nAbbreviations: CG, control group; HAG, group with defect \ufb01lled with hydroxyapatite microspheres; HAMgG, group with bone defect \ufb01lled with\nmagnesium-substituted hydroxyapatite micro spheres group; NS, not statistically signi \ufb01c a n t ;S ,s t a t i s t i c a l l ys i g n i \ufb01cant.\nRev Bras Ortop Vol. 59 No. 4/2024 \u00a9 2024.
