Past medical history was unremarkable except for \noxandrolone (an anabolic steroid) 30/day for bodybuilding 21 days before the presentation. He reported that his symptoms developed rapidly in the past two days. \nAfter taking patient consent, we started the treatment with a single dose of anti-androgen (proxlatumide 400 mg) followed by 200 mg daily for one week. There was \nno need for hospital admission. On-call follow-up showed a marked response with resolving of most symptoms. Follow-up for six weeks later demonstrated a full \nrecovery. \nDiscussion: Using anabolic androgen steroids have been considered a risk factor for developing pneumonia. With the wide use between bodybuilders, many reports \nshowed a link between the use of such drugs and COVID-19 disease. Anti-androgen drugs may lead to resolution of the symptoms. \nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case reporting the link between anabolic steroids use and covid-19 disease severity.   \n1.Introduction \nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak to be a pandemic situ-\nation as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated \nwith the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its highly contagious nature \n[1]. \nThis virus can affect the immune response and, in addition to res-\npiratory complications [2]. \nAnabolic androgen steroids (AAS) use during the pandemic has \nshown to have a negative impact. \nIt is also oftentimes acknowledged to be problematic, particularly the \nnegative health implications resulting from androgen use. Examples of \nthese implications include multiorgan damage and related negative \ncardiac effects. Indeed, there are a variety of specific health risks asso-\nciated with androgens and other Image and Performance, \nEnhancing Drugs (IPEDs) [3]. \nThe use of androgen could conceivably accelerate, exacerbate, or \neven initiate significantly more dangerous responses to COVID-19. There were no widely available case studies or peer reviewed re-\nsources that had clearly demonstrated a link between androgen use and \nincreased risk of mortality or disease severity from COVID-19, as well as \nassociated mental health challenges [4]. \nUsing androgen receptor inhibitors then, is considered a possible \ntherapeutic strategy to address the vulnerability of male individuals to \nsevere COVID-19 responses [5]. \nHere, we report a rare case of an otherwise healthy male athlete who \nused anabolic steroid for bodybuilding. He was diagnosed with covid-19 \ndisease. Treatment with an anti-androgen drug succeeded to help in \nrecovery. \nThis case report examines one such presentation in line with the \nCARE guidelines. \n2.Case presentation \nA 32 years old male with no known healthy problems presented to an \nout-patient clinic with cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle pain, \nand insomnia.

He is an athlete with regular \nvisiting gym since seven years ago. His past medical history was \nremarkable for taking oxandrolone 30/day for bodybuilding 21 days \nbefore the presentation. His claimed he did not take any medication such \nhormones. Vital signs were as follow: blood pressure was 110/65 mm/ \nHg. Pulse was 82/min, temperature was 38.1 Co, Spo2 was 94%, respi-\nratory rate was 19/min. His body mass index (BMI) was 27.2 kg/m2. \nPhysical examination showed a well-built man with just muscle \ntenderness. He was suspected to have COVID-19. Real-time reverse \ntranscription PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 test confirmed the diagnosis. C \nreactive protein level (CRP) was 29 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation \nrate. \n(ESR) was 12 mm/hour, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was 9.08 \nng/mL. Blood testosterone level was 140.3 ng/dl. \nBased on what we had and what the patient took (oxandrolone), we \nsuggested to treat the patient with anti-androgen drugs. After full \nexplaining the possible risks and taking the patient consent, we \nadministrated a single dose of proxlatumide 400 mg followed by 200 mg \ndaily for seven days. On-call follow-up after 48 hours demonstrated \ngreat response of most symptoms. Reassessment after five days showed a \ncomplete resolution of all the symptoms. His spo2 was 99%. Other \nlaboratories were: CRP dropped to 1.1 mg/l, ESR was 3.1 mm/hour, and \nCK-MB fell to 3.4 ng/ml. \nFollow-up for six weeks in the out-patient clinic showed no relapse of \nany symptom. \n3.Discussion \nAnabolic androgen steroids (AAS) and performance-enhancing drugs \nhave been previously reported to trigger severe viral pneumonia with \nacute respiratory distress syndrome in young patients [6]. \nThe relationship between androgens and COVID-19 is supported by \nthe epidemiological corroboration that prepubertal children are rarely \naffected by clinically severe COVID-19. \nIn a 2021 case study, Cadegiani et al. outline how an otherwise \nhealthy 28-year-old male recreational bodybuilder who was using 40 \nmg/day of oxandrolone (an androgen), presented severe COVID-19 \nsymptoms. The patient was given a single 600mg dose of a novel anti-\nandrogen, proxalutamide, and within 24 h demonstrated a significant \nimprovement in symptoms [6]. \nFurthermore, a randomized controlled trial investigated the effects \nof supplementing standard treatment with a 30-day course of dutaseride \non adult patients presenting with early COVID-19 symptoms. Compared \nwith placebo controls, treatment-arm patients (n\u00bc43) evidenced \nreduced disease duration, as well as lower reported fatigue and in-\nflammatory markers, by day 7 [3]. \nWe had a rare case of a previously health patient who is an athlete. \nHe was taking anabolic steroids before the presentation. After that, he \nhad many symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, and \nheadache. When he presented to out-patient clinic, he was diagnosed \nwith covid-19 disease. \nAfter a full discussion with the patients about the side effects of anti- \nandrogen drug, we decided to treat him by proxlatumide. He was not \nadmitted to the hospital. Follow-up by phone revealed a well response \nwith no other complains. After that, he showed a well recovery with \nresolution of all symptoms. \n4.Conclusion \nWe succeeded to treat an athlete male with severe covid-19 disease \nby administration of anti-androgen drug (proxlatumide). More research is needed to reach a standard treatment for patients with the use of \nanabolic steroid drugs and they have covid-19 disease. \nEthical approval \nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publi -\ncation of this case report and accompanying images, in line with local \nethical approval requirements.
